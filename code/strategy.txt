First: large experiments on 10000 (5000+5000 pairs) in background corpus
150 iterations, 100 potential imposters, 30 actual imposters (all these had limited effect in original paper):
- character 4-grams
- word unigrams
- word uni- and bigrams
Report maximal f-scores for each feature type > continue with best feature type

Now: tables with maximal f1-scores, but now randomly sample 10000 pairs (to simulate the real-world imbalance of both types of curves):
- vary nr of potential/actual imposters
- effect of nr_features
- effect of iterations


**** now we proceed to test set without Exp.
- compare best settings to Burrows's Delta by plotting densities for both minmax and delta
- show precision-recall curve and explain why we should optimize on precision
- run the expositio experiment
