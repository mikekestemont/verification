IN the last volume of the Transactions of the Geological Society, there is a description of the strata in the cliffs between Lymington and Muddiford near Christchurch; and, in a section accompanying the Memoir, the extent of the different formations exhibited in this line of coast is laid down. Large collections of the fossils of these cliffs have been made since the days of Brander, who published an account of them in 1766; and many have paid hasty visits to the spot, for the purpose chiefly of procuring fossil shells. But it was reserved for Mr. Webster to discover and first make known, in 1822, the existence of a distinct freshwater formation on the Hampshire coast, corresponding with the lower freshwater formation in the Isle of Wight. I have examined these freshwater strata in minute detail, their order of superposition, and their organic contents, with a view of furnishing data to geologists, for comparing these beds with those of the opposite coast of the Isle of Wight; and also to decide the question, on which doubts were entertained by the author of the Memoir above mentioned, whether the upper marine formation occupies any portion of Hordwell Cliff.
In determining the names of the shells, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. James Sowerby; without whose assistance in examining specimens of the marls brought from these cliffs, several of the organic remains would have been entirely overlooked.
The following is a list of the beds in the order of their superposition as they are seen rising from beneath each other with a gentle inclination to the east, as we proceed from the eastern extremity of Hordwell Cliff towards Barton Cliff. Their extent and position will be easily seen by referring to the annexed sketch. (See PI. XXX. No. 2.)
