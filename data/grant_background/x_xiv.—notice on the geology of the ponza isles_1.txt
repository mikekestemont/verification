xivnotice on the geology of the ponza isles by g poulett scrope esq fgs read april d may th and st all the islands that rise from the mediterranean off the coast of terracina and gaieta are often designated as the ponza isles from the name of the central and largest amongst them it would be more correct however to consider the three most westerly isles viz ponza palmarola and zannone together with the minor insulated rocks that are scattered round them as one group and ventotiene and san stefano which are separated from these by a considerable interval very little less indeed than that which divides them on the other side from ischia as a second these islands are all subject to the crown of naples two only are permanently inhabited or in cultivation ponza and ventotiene the former has a small but deep and extremely secure port though a number of halfconcealed rocks and sunk ledges near its entrance render it dangerous of approach to vessels of burden unless with an experienced pilot to the small craft that ply between genoa and naples it affords an invaluable refuge in the rough and variable weather for which the tuscan sea has been always notorious and the more important from the perilous character of the whole western coast of italy which from orbitello to naples consists of a sandy shore shoaling gradually to a great distance into the sea upon which a current constantly setting towards the land produces a violent and destructive surf in fact a number of boats are annually lost upon this shore which may be compared to the coast of lincolnshire or still more correctly to the low shore of africa between cape blanc and the canaries under such circumstances the harbour of ponza situated in deep water and at sufficient distance from the main coast to prevent risk in running for it is probably the means of saving annually a very considerable number of vessels and lives during one day that i was myself confined to the island by hard blowing weather no less than fifteen vessels occupied in different branches of the coasting trade put in for shelter these islands were imperfectly described by sir w hamilton in in the philosophical transactions dolomieu examined them in the subsequent year and published his observations in considerable detail in his memoire sur les isles ponces but at that period geological investigations were almost solely confined to the mineral characters of rocks or to crude speculations upon their origin very little attention being paid to their geognostical relations owing partly to this cause and in a great measure to the changes that have since taken place in the nomenclature of the science few fects of any importance are to be gleaned from the accounts of either writer and consequently we find these islands unnoticed in most general works on geology the vague descriptions of the french travellers being perhaps mistrusted while no more definite or recent observations have been made public by any other geologist still it was known from the account of dolomieu and from the specimens brought by him to paris that these islands consist principally of trachyte and contain some remarkable resinous and quartzose varieties of this rock the relations of which became an object of geological interest it was also known that the examination of them is facilitated by the constant degradation of their steep and naked cliffs occasioned by their exposed situation in a boisterous sea of great depth and the friable nature of many of their component rocks the few trachytic districts which have been as yet examined with attention and according to the improved method of modern science occur inland and great difficulty has uniformly been experienced in every endeavour to ascertain the relative positions of the different varieties that compose them a difficulty perhaps exaggerated by the prepossession for some favourite theory but chiefly owing to the facility with which the rocks of this family yield to the wasting influence of the weather in consequence of which their debris usually reach to so great a height against their escarpments that few natural sections of any extensive surface are to be obtained in traversing such inland districts the observations of the acutest geologist are almost necessarily limited to geographical data the intervals between the knolls or protruding masses of different varieties being concealed by detritus this is a source of peculiar obscurity among the trachytic formations which being unstratificd give no indications by the dip of their beds of the relative positions of their discordant members vertical sections in this case are invaluable and without them the geological observer is liable to be led into unavoidable and pernicious errors so general indeed and fatal is this difficulty that there still exist douhts in the minds of geologists of great experience and who have had opportunities of examining more than one trachytic district but under the disadvantages to which i allude as to whether this rock ever occurs in absolute superposition to any other for these reasons the ponza isles whose internal structure is completely laid open in the surfaces of their worn and skeleton forms become objects of considerable interest notwithstanding the comparative smallness of their extent such were the considerations which induced me to visit them in the beginning of may i was on the whole very fortunate in weather and was enabled by the calmness of the sea to explore almost every part of them at leisure making the tour of each in a boat and landing wherever it was judged necessary to examine more closely the composition of the cliffs by which they are invested this the largest island of the group has a very remarkable figure of extreme length in comparison with its width the former may be estimated at little more than four miles its width is exceedingly unequal the shores are eaten into numerous deep concavities seemingly produced by the undermining action of tle waves wherever the component rock was more friable than that of the intervening promontories when these points of extreme erosion accidentally correspond on either side the island is very nearly divided by the junction of the two opposite coves this occurs to a remarkable degree on two different points of the islands length in which its transverse dameter does not exceed a few hundred feet it is probable that in no great length of time a complete separation will be effected on both these spots one of which is the narrow strip of land that divides the cove called chiaja di luna from the harbour of ponza the other a still narrower ridge which backs the cala dlnferno and is now continually sapped by the breach of the sea on either side such a disjunction appears already to have taken place in more than one instance at the northern extremity of the island where a narrow channel cuts off from it the littl circular islet called la gabbia and further on in the prolongation of the same direction which is that of the longitudinal extent of the main island three or four insulated rocks rise above the waterlevel identical in constitution with the nearest extremity of ponza and connected with it by a reef which may be traced by soundings and seen on many points when the sea is calm the island of zannone stands at no great distance further on in the same line and forms the extremity of this range of submarine heights the proofs of rapid and continual destruction visible in the main island of ponza render it probable that the remaining insular eminences of this chain were once united even above the sea level the island does not offer a single uninterrupted and central ridge or axis with a gradual slope on either side as is often the case with such strips of elevated land its present form rather leads to the supposition that it once consisted of two parallel but irregular ridges branching off from the massive eminence which terminates the island to the south of these ridges the westerly one is almost wholly worn away by the violence of the swell to which this quarter is almost incessantly exposed the few more durable fragments that remain of it project as capes into the sea rising in height from the interior of the island to their extremity where they terminate in an abrupt cliff thus reversing the general figure of ordinary promontories the eastern range of hill not being subjected to so constant an erosive force isless degraded there are however few points on which any portion of its seaward slope remains the perpendicular escarpment of its waterworn face dropping in general directly from the acute edge of the opposite or landward slope a number of pointed and picturesque rocks of columnar trachyte rising from the sea on either side of the island at short distances from its steep cliffs add to the proofs of its greater original width in the same manner as those which connect zannone and la gabbia indicate its former extension in a longitudinal direction besides those which appear above the waterlevel there are many sunk rocks between and around them at a certain distance however from the island the water suddenly deepens and becomes unfathomable the southern extremity swells into a bulky and rounded eminence called la montagna della guardia a name common to the principal height of almost every island in the italian part of the mediterranean and derived from the lookout which till within a very few years was necessarily kept there day and night to give notice of the approach of the barbaresque corsairs which were in the habit of paying frequent spoliatory visits to these straggling and unprotected islands this mountain if it may be called so rises to about feet above the sea while no other point of the island exceeds it has a gradual and concave slope on the northeast towards the circular cove which forms the port and the neck of land which connects it with the remainder of the island on every other side it is bounded by cliffs with or without a talus at their base throughout the remaining circumference of the island in consequence of the depth of the sea by which it is continually corroded and probably by reason also of the existence of some marine current which sweeps away the detritus of its shores no accumulation of fragments appears to take place at the foot of their escarpments these therefore present the most complete natural sections in which the constitution of the island may be studied with the greatest facility the brilliant whiteness of many rocks the strongly contrasting colours of others their remarkable forms and the irregular manner in which they are mutually disposed give an extraordinary and striking aspect to the island particularly when approached from the east the range of cliffs on this side seen from a short distance presents the characters of an ideal geological section coloured with conventional tints to distinguish the different rocks which compose it the colours made use of for this purpose in the accompanying sketches are the same as in nature and scarcely deepened in tint the substance of the island with the exception perhaps of the massive bed which forms the capping and the southern front of the montagna della guardia is trachyte this rock however varies considerably and frequently in character the mineral composition of these varieties is very similar all consist principally of felspar and differ only in a greater or less admixture of mica and quartz the rock which from its superior durability appears to support and strengthen the less solid parts with which it is intimately associated is universally prismatic and generally divided into groups of small but very regular columns from which common character i will distinguish it for the present by the name of prismatic trachyte its predominant colour when broken is grayish or whitish yellow mottled with irregularly parallel streaks of a pinkish brown ochry brown or blackish blue tint the surface of the columns and consequently the natural face of the rock is of an ochry brown apparently produced by the infiltration of an oxide of iron the ferruginous matter has frequently penetrated to the interior of the prisms producing rows of concentric stripes usually parallel to the outer surface and wholly independent of the direction of the other streaks or zones mentioned above the latter distinguish themselves by alternations of different texture as well as colour the darker layers being universally more compact and finegrained as well as harder than the intervening parts of a lighter tint these zones traverse uninterruptedly a great extent of rock without any regard to the position of the columns and generally cutting them at some angle to their axis thus indicating that a partial modification of internal structure in the substance of the rock preceded its separation into prismatic concretions they are not necessarily straight but frequently waved or contorted in concentric curvatures like the stripes of certain varieties of marbled paper and this both on the large and small scale the thickness of the streaks varies from some inches to that of the finest thread this variegated appearance is at times exchanged for one in which the reck assumes the character of a breccia of fragments of different colours and grain embedded in a zoned basis this latter variety generally occurs towards the extremity of the mass and where it loses its prismatic division this species of trachyte usually exhibits an earthygranular base consisting of felspar with numerous imbedded plates of mica hexagonal or rhomboidal but seldom entire and imperfect halffused crystals of glassy felspar it is porous particularly the more earthy and lightercoloured lamina and the direction of the porous parts as well as of the vacuities themselves coincides with that of the stripes the darkcoloured zones are not only of a finer and closer grain than the intermediate layers but harder and apparently more siliceous in some places they become so compact as to communicate to the rock a sharp and splintery fracture approaching to conchoidal and a flinty aspect this is particularly the case where it resembles a breccia on these points the rock flies when touched by the hammer in the manner of flint and rings like glass the imbedded fragments are often not always equally siliceous with the base and so firmly cemented to it as never to separate at the line of contact they seem to be portions of the zoned or variegated trachyte broken off by friction before the whole was consolidated and enveloped in the parts which still remained liquid where the alternate zones are most contrasted in colour and texture the whiter and more friable ones show a minute spherolitic structure the globules are of felspar generally hollow and internally ragged and angular the base is compact finegrained somewhat siliceous and of a dark gray or a reddish brown colour complete and gradual transitions from this to the ordinary zoned or marbled variety may be observed within the compass of the same block the spherolitic concretions increasing in number and appearing drawn out into a long ellipsoidal or lenticular form until they form together a whitish earthy zone or vein while the intervening compact matter is equally stretched out into stripes which retain their colour and texture these passages lead me to be of opinion that even where no traces of spherolitic structure are visible the ribboned arrangement of the rock is owing to the mass of matter having been drawn out in the direction of the zones while still liquid after a previous separation had taken place of the feldspathose spherolites which are analogous to the vitrolithoid globules of glass furnaces and the impure semisiliceous base a close examination of these zones makes it obvious that the finer and darker parts possessed a higher fluidity than the earthy and more feldspathose ones and that the different degrees of mobility of these alternate layers was the chief cause of their irregular wavings and contortions almost every distinct crystal of felspar or mica may likewise be observed to have produced a similar irregularity in the neighbouring zones proportioned to its size and form by the resistance it offered to their freedom of motion the elongated crystals of both minerals have generally taken the direction of the movement their longer axes lying more or less in the plane of the zones and frequently a single crystal of felspar will appear to have been broken up and carried away piecemeal by the friction of the neighbouring laminae leaving a train of halffused fragments with empty spaces between them the columns into which this rock is divided assume every direction though with a general tendency to the vertical they are sometimes united into fanshaped clusters at others the rock appears separated into irregular vertical beds composed of columns arranged in bundles like faggots and disposed horizontally or nearly so their axes being always perpendicular to the sides of the bed or vertical seams the width of the bed is always proportioned to the diameter of the columns they are sometimes bent in one or more directions preserving however their general parallelism and recovering by degrees the straight direction on either side they are usually small and the smallest are the most regular very perfect five or sixsided prisms from half an inch to four or five in diameter are closely grouped together in vast numbers into clusters and by the sharpness of their angles seen in the perpendicular face of the cliffs exhibit an appearance which was compared both by dolomieu and hamilton to some kinds of roman brickwork those columns which are piled horizontally are universally the least and shortest the vertical ones much longer and of greater diameter the superior hardness of this rock aided probably by its prismatic structure which under a certain arrangement of the columns adds to the durability of the mass as much as a different disposition often facilitates its destruction has enabled it on many points to resist lie breach of the sea more effectually than the other varieties of trachyte and the conglomerates hence it constitutes most of the insulated rocks that surround the island its columnar structure adding much to the picturesque effect of their outline the prismatic trachyte also forms a large part of the main island particularly of its southern moiety it abounds throughout the range of vertical cliffs of the whole eastern shore as well as on the opposite side of the island from the punta del fielo to that de paraglioni in these natural sections it is constantly accompanied by a rock which i am about to describe with which it alternates in irregular massive beds assuming every possible direction except perhaps the horizontal in its ordinary character it consists of an earthy and very friable substance of a pure white or grayish white colour inclosing numerous fragmentary blocks of an ash gray or grayish green semivitreous trachyte which have in general much of the fibrous structure and elongated cells of pumice are extremely brittle and light and occasionally pass into common glassy pumice on a close examination the basis of the rock appears to consist of pulverulent particles of the same substance it crumbles easily and seldom possesses sufficient solidity to allow a specimen to be preserved entire the inclosed fragments reach the size of a foot or more in diameter they contain imbedded glassy felspars and bronzed mica these crystals occur also but less frequently in a loose state in the earthy base some few of the fragments consist of trachyte without any glassy lustre and resembling the prismatic trachyte described above or other varieties not met with in situ in the island one large block which i took out of this conglomerate was identical with the loose crystalline trachytic lava of the monte tabor in ischia of a dead leaf colour with numerous large and distinct crystals of glassy felspar none of the fragments are waterworn and they all have evidently been enveloped in the base immediately upon their ejection by the volcanic impetus they cohere strongly to the matrix but are separated from it by decided fracture lines which as well as their variety and number make it impossible to doubt that the rock is essentially a conglomerate in spite of the remarkable passages it exhibits by insensible gradations into rocks of a different character the inclosed fragments from their superior solidity protrude from the weatherworn surface of the cliffs and protect the line of rock immediately beneath from the rain by which the more exposed parts on either side are corroded giving rise to pyramidal or buttressshaped masses each capped by one of the larger blocks and standing out from the front of the escarpment in parallel rows when these are in considerable number an effect is produced which may be easily mistaken at a distance for the result of a columnar division the rock is on the contrary amorphous with the exception of an obscure appearance of irregular stratification which shows itself in some masses the larger fragments being arranged in parallel lines like the flints of our chalkbeds a character far from uncommon amongst the volcanic conglomerates it has been observed that the prismatic trachyte and this conglomerate are associated confusedly throughout the greater part of the island interrupting each other alternately with an irregularity of direction of which the accompanying profiles will convey a clearer idea than any verbal description the general impression arising from an examination of all their relations is that the prismatic trachyte has broken through the conglomerate from below and forms irregular intruded masses or dykes within it on some few points however the former rock appears to have overspread the surface of the latter and to have been in turn covered by other beds of conglomerate change observable at the point of contact of the conglomerate with the prismatic trachyte it is remarkable that throughout the numerous sections afforded of the common boundary of these two rocks in the precipitous shores of the island the conglomerate is found almost without a single exception to be altered at the plane of contact with the prismatic trachyte this alteration extends from two to thirty feet in depth when the natural section of the rock cuts the plane of junction at right angles when its direction is oblique or partially parallel to that plane of course the alteration extends over a much larger surface of the bare cliff and at first induces the false notion of the existence of very considerable masses of the altered rock this consideration must be borne in mind in studying the profiles of these cliffs the change consists in the gradual transition of the while and earthy base of the conglomerate as well as of the cellular and glassy fragments it incloses into a compact resinous trachyte or pitchstone porphyry of a dark bottlegreen colour containing numerous crystals of glassy felspar and bronzed mica and breaking readily into lamellar and rhomboidal fragments this at least is its predominant character occasionally it exhibits a testaceoglobular structure becoming a pearlstone similar to that of iceland and the andes of a greenishgray colour and pearly lustre in other places it assumes a still more regular globular concretionary division both on the large and small scale in the latler case the rock resembles an aggregation of beads breaking into concentric layers this variety contains cellular and fibrous parts like the vesicular obsidian of lipari the large globiform structure is strikingly exemplified in a rock which projects from the cliff within the chiaja di luna near the entrance of the roman gallery the alteration appears here to have proceeded to a great depth and the globiform structure occurs in that part of the pitchstone bed which is nearest to the junction with the prismatic trachyte the rock shows a tendency to the columnar division the columns separating into large globes or ellipsoids placed one above the other these balls when they have been exposed a short time to the weather desquamate at a touch into numerous concentric coats like those of a bulbous root inclosing a compact nucleus of which the laminae have not been sufficiently loosened by decomposition though the application of s ruder blow will produce a still further exfoliation the globes vary from a few inches to three feet in diameter this structure passes not only into the columnar but also into the lamellar the lamellae being either straight or twisted into the most intricate contortion the longest axis of the ellipsoids is invariably in the direction of the lamellar or prismatic system to which they belong these varieties of natural division are certainly not produced by decomposition which has evidently only assisted in disclosing an original configuration in the globular pitchstone this process has been accelerated by the quantity of cubic pyrites disseminated throughout it sometimes in the immediate vicinity of the prismatic trachyte the pitchstone incloses small nuclei of obsidian of an olive green colour translucent at the edges and with the conchoidal fracture of glass and the pitchstone becomes more finegrained compact and homogeneous the nearer it lies to the boundary of the prismatic trachyte this boundary is universally an abrupt and decided separation but on the other side the former rock graduates insensibly into the earthy and friable conglomerate passing through a modification of pitchstone of which the predominant colours are an orangegreen and a waxy yellow it contains the same minerals and has the same texture and lamellar structure as the dark bottlegreen pitchstone except that as it recedes from the latter rock it becomes less compact and slightly porous the conglomerate structure may be traced very clearly through this intermediate rock the imbedded fragments sometimes assume the resinous lustre and texture more completely than the base sometimes the reverse takes place probably according to the original nature of the fragments when these were of earthy unverified trachyte they have resisted more or less the agency which tended to reduce them to pitchstone and remain visibly enveloped in the more resinous base this often exhibits a wrinkled appearance incircling these refractory fragments from which it appears to have possessed a partial fluidity this rock is frequently penetrated by minute veins filled with a white earthy substance of a feldspathose character they traverse both varieties of pitchstone and ramify into the conglomerate without changing their direction in the chiaja di prontone two vertical dykes averaging two feet in width cut through the green pitchstone which appears here of unusual extent they are filled with a loose white trachytic conglomerate extremely finegrained it was probably washed into fissures of the rock by the water which held it in suspension the constant occurrence of these bands of green and yellow pitchstone at the junction of the prismatic trachyte and the semivitreous conglomerate and the easy gradations of colour texture and structure by which they invariably pass into the latter rock unquestionably prove them to proceed from its alteration by contact with the prismatic trachyte in fact this rock as has been already noticed bears on most points the appearance of having forced its way upwards by cutting through the incumbent conglomerate in various directions and occasionally of having spread laterally over it its regular cojumnar division which has without doubt been assumed subsequently to the occupation of its actual position proves it to have been protruded in a state of liquidity or at least of softness this liquidity as well as its elevation could only have been the result of intense heat and it may therefore easily be believed to have effected the partial fusion of the fine and loose base of the feldspathose conglomerate and of the imbedded fragments of this rock already in a semivitreous state and therefore more easily fusible with which it came in contact the compactness of texture resulting from this imperfect fusion as well as the local varieties of concretionary structure are probably owing to the pressure and friction sustained during the forcible protrusion of the prismatic trachyte and locally modified by accidental circumstances the porphyritic character of the pitchstone will not prevent our recognising it to proceed from the fusion of an earthy conglomerate rock since both the fragments dispersed through the unchanged rock are themselves porphyritic and the earthy pulverulent basis incloses broken crystals of felspar and mica which in the pitchstone porphyry have only been rendered more visible by the semifusion and discolouration of the finer and less refractory matter that envelops them the semivitreous conglomerate appears on some few spots to inclose irregular and indistinct beds of a very earthy trachyte of an ashgray or yellowish white colour with numerous felspar crystals and plates of mica its hardest parts are identical with the prismatic trachyte but it does not ever like this assume a columnar division it is often slightly zoned with brownish yellow streaks and is fissile in their direction from the earthiness and loose texture of its base it is seldom possible to determine its line of separation from the earthy conglomerate with which it is intimately associated and which is evidently of contemporaneous formation for this reason no attempt has been made to distinguish the two rocks in the accompanying profiles where this earthy trachyte comes in contact with the prismatic it suffers the same alteration as the neighbouring conglomerate being converted to a certain distance into green pitchstone or more frequently into a pearlstone which exhibits superficially a kind of bloom similar to that of a plum and contains some white and cellular parts the alternations and mutual interruptions of the rocks above described will be observed from the plates to be repeated throughout the southern half of ponza towards the northern extremity the prismatic trachyte almost entirely disappears with the exception of a pyramidal mass of rock which forms the extreme point called the punta dell incenso opposite the islet of la gabbia it is not visible on the eastern face of the island beyond the chiaja del schiavone nor on the western north of the punta de faraglioni the cliffs within this space are composed of the semivitreous conglomerate to a certain distance beyond which the mass of the island consists solely of an anomalous rock of very variable and singular characters and constant only in its extremely siliceous nature from this circumstance i may distinguish it by the name of siliceous trachyte in their external features the escarpments formed of this rock and exposed to the erosion of the seaspray and meteoric agents strongly resemble the siliceous burrstone of the paris basin having the same carious hatched and angular surfaces their predominant colour is yellowish white or gray under its most general form this rock offers a white earthy and friable substance traversed by irregular concretionary parts of a compact texture an ashgray colour and often a flinty lustre these usually constitute the greater part of the rock the earthy portions cut with the knife like fine chalk which they exactly resemble in outward appearance their whiteness is often of the purest and most dazzling brilliancy and their detritus carried off by the rain from the rocks in the interior of the island is collected from the beds of torrents and made use of as whiting by the inhabitants the compacter parts seldom yield to the knife at all both appear to consist of nearly pure silex and are fused with the greatest difficulty by the blowpipe they contain a few disseminated crystals of mica which are in general wholly or partially decomposed into an ochry earth the fissures of this rock are often lined with ferruginous dendrites or with a coating of delicate quartz crystals by degrees the compact parts predominate still further and inclose numerous very perfect crystals of felspar some of which are in the state of kaolin while others are glassy and brilliant roundish grains of pellucid quartz and a few rare crystals of black mica the basis of this porphyritic rock is close grained and exceedingly siliceous it is heavy solid and tough of straight and rather uneven fracture a clear grayish white colour and strikes fire readily with steel through this rock the white earthy parts only appear scattered in irregular patches giving it a brecciated aspect and often disappear altogether for a considerable space at the northern extremity of ponza west of the punta dell incenso this quartzose porphyritic trachyte is traversed by an irregular vertical vein from six inches to two feet in diameter which incloses where it is widest a number of fragments of the same rock evidently broken off from the sides the vein is filled by a blackish clay studded with cubical iron pyrites with a smaller proportion of copper accompanied by crystals of quartz this ore as well as the crystals is attached in greatest quantity to the sides of the vein and the surfaces of the fragments it incloses coating them over with a metallic crust and impregnating the substance of the rock to a certain distance with disseminated pyrites a brown and yellow clay iron ore also encrusts the sides of the vein in some spots and stains the rock to which it is attached to the depth of a few inches the washing of this vein by the seaspray and rain clothes its exposed surfaces with a coating of green carbonate of copper on the west side of ponza and particularly within the chiaja delle forne this siliceous trachyte presents the appearance of a coarse breccia irregular masses of a fragmentary aspect seem to be cemented by a less compact and often very earthy basis into which however they may be often observed to throw out venous ramifications or pass by insensible gradations if therefore they were originally fragments most of them must have been enveloped before they were entirely hardened as was conjectured above in the case of the siliceous and brecciform parts of the prismatic trachyte these blocks are generally ribboned or mottled with blue brown red yellow lightgreen white and an infinity of intermediate tints their texture is usually close fine grained and flinty they also possess the lustre and general aspect of flint sometimes the grain approaches to that of chalcedony and the cavities are lined with a mammillated coating of this substance which graduates into the surrounding rock imbedded plates of mica and imperfect felspar crystals occur in them in the earthy parts the mica is usually decomposed into rusty specks this rock rings like glass under the hammer and flies into exceedingly sharpedged fragments translucent at the edges it is in general heavy and dense but in some parts becomes light and porous the cells are then elongated in parallel lines the crystals of felspar and mica appear drawn out in the same direction the former broken up and half fused in this state it appears passing into pumice but is equally siliceous with the compacter parts it is often intersected by veins of almost pure quartz of a milkwhite colour some of these are or inches in width and are cancellated or formed of plates crossing one another so as to leave angular spaces between them in disposition and aspect they are very similar to the quartz veins of granite and gneiss where any fissures occur they are lined with quartz crystals amongst the massive blocks inclosed in this brecciated rock i observed one of extraneous origin it is granitoidal composed of glassy felspar quartz and a very little mica this fragment left its impression in the siliceous rock on being detached while the other masses of fragmentary appearance will not separate along their seeming boundary lines towards the upper parts of this extremity of the island and particularly at the summit of the cliffs which face the east between the punta dell incenso and the promontory marked in the map the siliceous trachyte passes into another variety of rock also of a fragmentary character which wherever it has been long exposed to meteoric action is rendered extremely carious and acquires a deadleaf or ironrust colour with a dull earthy aspect the fragments generally appear fibrous like pumice and are united together by a siliceous cement this cement resists decomposition while the fragments it envelops have decayed to a considerable depth into a sort of clay which mixes readily with water and is therefore easily carried away by the rains and hence arises the cavernous and corroded character of the exposed parts of the rock the fragments themselves also decompose unequally from containing alternate hard and softer zones and their fibrous aspect is in great part derived from this circumstance this rock in its unaltered state is traversed by irregular fissures which are lined with numerous groups of quartz crystals some measuring an inch in length having frequently an amethystine tinge or coated with red oxide of iron some of the fragments also appear to be agglutinated by limpid quartz and oxide of iron such are the different varieties of this singular rock all of which pass insensibly into one another it is not easy to determine the real relations of the siliceous trachyte to the semivitreous conglomerate which succeeds it on the south at the western side of the island the former rock seems to overlie the latter but in the cliffs on the opposite shore their position is reversed at each spot the limits of the two rocks are evanescent and it is impossible to say where one ends and the other begins this uncertainty is perhaps occasioned in part by a mutual penetration taking place along their common boundary but chiefly by the difficulty of distinguishing the white earthy base of the conglomerate from the equally white and earthy parts of the siliceous trachyte the small capshaped islet called la gabbia which is divided from the northern extremity of ponza by a narrow strait consists entirely of siliceous trachyte presenting the same varieties as in the main island prom the above details which will i fear be found tediously minute but which were rendered necessary by the complex and singular nature of the rocks to be described it will appear that the trachytic rocks of the island of ponza are distinguishable into two masses the one an earthy trachyte pretty uniform in structure and composition associated with a conglomerate of pumice and semivitreous trachyte which is almost universally converted into pitchstone near the former rock the other a very quartzose porphyritic trachyte of a novel and anomalous character which is also accompanied by breccias and conglomerates equally siliceous the relative positions and mutual interference of these varieties will be best understood from the accompanying outline sketches of the principal cliff ranges of the island the most interesting of these natural sections is that which circumscribes the chiaja di luna a deep semicircular cove opening to the west and corresponding to the harbour of ponza a similar indentation of the eastern shore from which it is only separated by a narrow and rocky isthmus across this the romans when masters of ponza effected a communication for land carriage between the opposite bays by means of an arched gallery cut through the rock of prismatic trachyte and lined with reticulated brickwork this passage still remains entire and carries off the waters that drain down the concave slope of the montagna della guardia towards the port which would otherwise do considerable injury to the town and quays by wearing away the friable conglomerate on which they are chiefly built the cliffs forming either horn of this crescent the chiaja di lunaf present the usual irregular intermixture of the prismatic trachyte and semivitreous conglomerate the latter invariably passing into pitchstone towards its line of contact with the former the central part of the curve is occupied by a deep bed of loose earthy tufa trachytic conglomerate j both the upper and lower parts of this mass contain coarse fragments of pumice and compact trachyte disclosing its stratification which in the intermediate bed is not perceivable from the uniform fineness of the fragmentary matter this rock contains a few broken crystals of felspar and mica and a large proportion of magnetic ironsand its characters are very distinct from those of the semivitreous conglomerate already described it possesses little or no coherence and incloses none of those blocks of glassy trachyte which are characteristic of the other rock a similar conglomerate occurs on other neighbouring parts of the island but never shows any signs of disturbance always overlying the rocks already described and adapting its strata to the irregularities of their surfaces in the instance under consideration the disposition of these fragmentary strata proves them to have been deposited subsequently to the formation of the prismatic trachyte against which they lean on either side apparently filling a deep chasm between these two masses which in all probability was the result of some violent convulsion this observation may appear superfluous but is called for by the resemblance of the nearly vertical bed of trachyte on the right side to a dyke or intruded mass its evidently posterior origin to the tufa which bounds it on one side proves that it cannot have been really produced in that manner the natural section of this bed of tufa presents an absolutely vertical wall about feet high which being sapped by the waves whenever the westerly winds blow directly into the cove peels off at intervals in massive laminae and thus continually offers a fresh surface beds of a similar conglomerate probably once a continuation of the same mass are observable on the south side of the cove one portion of them has been deposited on the uneven and concave surface of a mass of prismatic trachyte all the strata following the sinuous outline of the latter rock another set of strata lie horizontally across the edges of two neighbouring masses of the prismatic trachyte and semivitreous conglomerate as well as of the former waved tufa all of which must have simultaneously suffered a certain degree of denudation before its deposition these beds of tufaceous conglomerate contain large fragments of all the varieties of trachyte mentioned above which have the aspect and forms commonly met with in the ejected blocks of volcanic conglomerates another series of similar strata and equally to all appearance a continuous part of the same deposit shows itself on the opposite side of the island forming a line of cliffs which range southward from the punta della madonna at the entrance of the harbour of ponza these also rest indifferently upon the prismatic trachyte and semivitreous conglomerate no alteration is ever observable in them at their boundary with the former rock their separation from the latter is equally decided and complete both had evidently been consolidated before their deposition and have remained undisturbed ever since the same tufa crops out on two or three other points towards the base of the montagna della guardia and forms a partial covering to the slopes of the hills to the north and west of the harbour this stratified conglomerate is in turn surmounted by the huge bed of rock which caps the montagna della guardia and occasions its superior elevation over all the other heights of the island where no subsequent formation covers the primary trachytes this rock varies in colour from a dark iron gray to a reddish or purplish gray and lead blue it is uniformly dense heavy and extremely hard striking fire readily with steel and so tough that specimens can with difficulty be obtained from it by a hammer of the largest size very few porous parts are observable it appears to be composed principally of crystalline felspar varying in the size of the grain from the compactness of some clinkstones which it then resembles to a coarse granitoidal aggregation of large and brilliant but imperfect crystals of gray or reddish white felspar with a few small crystals and numerous minute grains of augite and some hexagonal prisms of mica i met with some felspar crystals nearly three inches in diameter and these are accompanied by augite bearing the same proportion to them in size as the ordinary minute grains to the commonsized felspars in some parts the basis alone is gray and incloses a vast number of distinct rhomboidal felspars of a reddish colour which project from the exposed surfaces of the rock by the destruction of the intermediate matter in general the colour appears to be owing to the dissemination of minute augite and even in the large felspar crystals which are decidedly tinged with the predominant hue of the rock there is probably a certain proportion of augitic matter introduced sufficient to produce this effect this rock is every where more or less columnar the columns of the upper part of the bed which caps the hill are rudely formed and of an enormous size lower down they become more regular and smaller the detached rock forming the punta della guardia the extreme southern point of the island is an example of very perfect columns collected into a fascicular group and with a double curvature many columns by exposure to meteoric action and particularly to the seaspray become carious wasting exactly in the manner if i may be allowed the comparison of a decaying tooth their coating is of a more durable nature than the interior so that when once decomposition has worn through this crust on any single point it advances rapidly in all directions through the inner substance leaving the shell comparatively whole the rock described above is one example of a particular species of felspar rock which occurs very frequently among the volcanic districts of italy it is always closely related to trachyte and occasionally assumes in some of its parts the mineralogical features of that rock it is generally however distinguished from it by a greater closeness of grain and weight by its uniformly darker colours and the compactness and brilliancy of its felspar crystals it passes on the other hand by acquiring a scaly texture great compactness and a laminar structure into phonolite clinkstone and when the latter character is wanting into compact felspar in mineral constitution it is identical with many rocks which have been classed by geologists under one or other of these terms being composed principally of felspar with a small proportion never perhaps above per cent of augite hornblende or mica its specific gravity ranges from to to avoid circumlocution and at the same time distinguish it from those other rocks of the same family i shall designate it for the present by the name of graystone its colour is in fact the most constant as well as obvious character of the rock and wherever i have observed it is uniformly of some shade of gray generally leaden purplish or iron gray even the disseminated felspar crystals usually share more or less in the predominant tint of their basis the same rock appears in the scoglio della botte ventotiene and san stefano amongst the ponza isles it is of very frequent occurrence throughout ischia the insulated rock on which the castle is built is a wellknown example it is found in the northwest angle of procida in the hill of cumae at marmorata in the monte olibano and many other points of the phlegraean fields in almost all the lipari isles and among some of the older currents of itna in most of these spots its disposition is obviously that of a lava bed or current and in some the crater whence it issued can still be distinguished the massive covering of graystone from which the montagna della guardia derives its bossshaped form is upwards of feet in thickness towards the east it rises in a bluff cliff from a rapidly sloping talus strewn with enormous blocks that have fallen from above where the vertical face of the rock takes off from this inclined plane a stratum of bright red friable tufa like coarse brickdust crops out from beneath the graystone and reposes on the white semivitreous conglomerate here therefore is another instance of partial alteration in a conglomerate by contact with a later mass of lavarock though in this case the alteration has not proceeded to any degree of fusion or vitrification as in the instance of the pitchstone beds on the south the graystone descends to a lower level and sinks beneath the sea in the punta della guardia on either side of this cape it may be seen to lie directly on the semivitreous trachytic conglomerate which here exhibits no appearance of change at the plane of contact probably because the heated mass having flowed from above down the slope of the hill cooled superficially as it advanced and upon reaching this rock did not retain sufficient heat to influence its texture in fact this is the habitual conduct of ordinary lavacurrents which are seldomit may i believe be said neverfound to produce any alteration of importance in the rocks which they meet with in their descent it is while the boiling matter is forcing its way from below through theoverlying strata which impede its expansion as was the case with all the largest kind of dykes and protruded masses of the trap family and before it has been enabled to part with the intense caloric that actuates its rise upon the easy terms afforded by the open atmosphere that the rocks with which it then comes in contact suffer from its proximity and this in a degree determined by their nature the duration of the contact the temperature of the lavamass and other modifying circumstances westward of the punta della guardia the graystone sends out into the sea another low promontory called the punta del fielo which forms the southern limit of the chiaja di luna here some strata of loose tufa appear broken through as well as covered by the contiguous rock these are evidently the prolongation of the strata seen beneath the cap of the hill from the chiaja di luna the whole mass of graystone is continuous forming but one entire bed and apparently bearing the same relation to the somewhat basinshaped concavity occupied by the harbour of ponza as the analogous though smaller rock of the monte olibano near pozzuoli to the crater of the solfatara in fact the disposition of the stratified tufa which clothes the principal slopes of this basina much safer criterion than mere formpoints it out as the remnant of a large crater as was judiciously observed by dolomieu graystone occurs in no other part of the island palmarvia the high and rocky islet of palmarola lies about four miles and a half west of ponza and in a parallel direction to it it is scarcely two miles in length and of a very unequal breadth like ponza this island seems to have lost much of its original extent detached groups of craggy rocks stretch to a considerable distance from both its northern and southern extremities on the west side rise three or four similar masses lofty precipitous and separated from the main islet these and the steep cliffs by which it is girt round exhibit unequivocal signs of the powerful degradation to which it is exposed particularly on the western shore from the superior violence of the swell occasioned by the prevailing winds which blow from that quarter over a vast expanse of open sea this destroying force tends rapidly to separate the island into two nearly equal parts the opposite indentations which occur towards the middle of its length called la forcina and porto are indeed already connected by a narrow channel practicable to small boats in the formation of which however art appears to have assisted nature on either side of this channel the island rises to a height of from four to five hundred feet swelling gradually towards the south into a peaked eminence overhanging a steep cliff of tufa and situated near what may be supposed the centre of the original area of the island the northern height forms a steep domeshaped mass resembling in its outline the montagna della guardia in ponza the surface of palmarola is well wooded and its appearance particularly on the western side extremely romantic and picturesque it is neither inhabited nor cultivated and therefore clothed in the unchecked and exuberant vegetation natural to the climate and fostered by the richness of the soil the myrtle dwarfpalm and wildfigtree spring up with peculiar luxuriance wherever a few feet of rocky ledge afford them sufficient depth of soil while the cytisus genista cistus and numerous tribes of aromatic herbs occupy every cleft in the craggy cliffs the precipitous shores of this island exhibit the same abrupt and irregular intermixture of the prismatic trachyte and the semivitreous conglomerate which has been observed in ponza the conglomerate here also as in ponza graduates in every instance into dark bottlegreen pitchstone where it comes in contact with the prismatic trachyte i could not observe any indications of the siliceous trachyte which forms so large a part of the other island the prismatic trachyte however becomes highly siliceous in many parts and is universally ribboned with a multiplicity of zones of different shades of white yellow blue and brown varying in compactness and in the proportion of silex they contain these zones are still more constant and remarkable than in the analogous rock of ponza their wavings and contortions on the small as well as on the large scale resemble those of micaschist and gneiss here also as in ponza there exists every indication of the zones being owing to the rock having been drawn out in their direction while in a halfliquid state after a partial separation had taken place of the pure feldspathose part from the mixed siliceous base the local obstacles both internal and external that more or less impeded this motion were obviously the cause of the irregularities of the laminae this species of trachyte composes the greater part of the island and all the insulated rocks around apparently detached from it by the destruction of the intervening conglomerate which yields with greater facility to the erosive action of the waves the columnar division prevails but the columns are generally larger than those of ponza on the north side they present vertical ranges of great magnificence and regularity running up to a height of from one to two hundred feet many of the columns are articulated the exposure of these mural ranges to the breach of the sea at the north point has produced several caves of no great depth but with a striking architectural effect resembling that of pingal in staffa but having in general a much more lofty entrance some detached rocks have by the same process been perforated with arches the zones of this rock are unequally affected by the wasting influence of the atmosphere the loose feldspathose layers decomposing more readily than the others and this circumstance gives the false appearance of a schistose or laminar structure to the exposed surfaces of the rock the direction of the zones which is continuous through a great extent and seems usually to coincide with that of the bed or dyke itself cuts the axes of the columns indifferently at every angle the surface of the rocks as at ponza is of a rusty or bluish brown the huge rocky boss that forms the northern extremity of palmarola entirely consists of prismatic trachyte it may be observed to abut at a very high angle upon rocks of a different nature on either side of the island to the east the supporting rock is the ordinary white conglomerate with fragments of glassy trachyte which is converted as usual into dark green resinous trachyte pitchstone the passage taking place as elsewhere by imperceptible gradations through a band of reddish yellow semiresinous trachyte on the opposite side of the hill fronting the west the northern rock of prismatic trachyte is separated from another mass of the same nature by an intervening bed nearly vertical of a dark coloured pearlstone from to feet in thickness which graduates into the latter rock and appears to be the result of an alteration produced by the contact of the neighbouring trachytic rock similar and contemporaneous to that effected by the same mass in the conglomerate on the other side of the island the prismatic trachyte subjected to this change has lost its columnar division but preserved its zoned structure the pearlstone presenting the same parallel and often sinuous laminae which retain a general parallelism of direction to those of the unchanged rock the texture of the alternate stripes varies likewise in the pearlstone the basis of which consists of a compact substance of pearly lustre and a deep leadblue colour breaking into small angular pieces this is ribboned by numerous thin zones of black enamel pitchstone strongly resembling obsidian having a complete conchoidal fracture but wanting the acuteness and transparency of the fractureedges which characterize that mineral these zones of black pitchstone may be observed to be themselves passing into pearlstone by inclosing more or less numerous minute spheroids of this substance identical in colour texture and lustre with the broader zones which consist of an intimate and confused agglomeration of similar globules and have acquired their semilithoidal texture and clearer colour by a devitrification of the pitchstone in the part of the bed lying nearest to the prismatic trachyte by which the change seems to have been accomplished the zones are distorted into very irregular and repeated curvatures and contain large knots and lenticular masses of black glassy pitchstone this variety of pitchstone is rarely porphyritic it decomposes superficially and at the sides of the minute and otherwise imperceptible fissures which intersect the rock at right angles to the plane of the lamina into a compact white substance hence wherever the fracture has followed these fissures the pearlstone appears ribboned with white instead of black stripes this alteration is in some parts not confined to the surface but affects the whole thickness of the layer of pitchstone which then resembles a pure white enamel retaining its conchoidal fracture the southern moiety of palmarola is principally formed of loose stratified conglomerate or tufa strata of this nature compose in particular a lofty cliff facing the southeast and extending from the capo di vardella to the punta di mezzogiorno they everywhere repose conformably on the irregular surfaces of the prismatic trachyte and its accompanying semivitreous conglomerate they are of the same character as those of ponza consisting principally of triturated pumice and inclosing particularly in the lower strata larger blocks of this substance the scoriae of the accompanying trachytes and a few compacter fragments of the neighbouring rocks amongst the latter i found some of an ashgray pearlstone imbedding numerous crystals of felspar and others of a similar rock in which the felspar is very brilliant and glassy the spherolitic globules being irregular generally hollow and lined with minute crystals apparently of the same substance while others closely envelop a single imperfect felspar crystal zannone i have already adverted to the island of zannone as lying in the ideal prolongation of ponza with which it is connected by a chain of sunk rocks detected by soundings besides the more obvious ones which rise above the waterlevel in the same line the area of this island is scarcely a mile in its longest dimension which runs north and south and half a mile in width it consists of a ragged longitudinal ridge rising gradually from the southern extremity and after suffering one abrupt depression from which it recovers immediately terminating towards the n at a considerable height in a steep and rocky promontory called capo negro
