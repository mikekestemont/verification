green castle st marys presents trap rocks closely resembling that afforded by the agua alta being not far distant from it between belmont st andrews and green castle i observed a porphyritic rock having a light brown earthy base containing crystals of whitish felspar a few pieces of green hornblende and a few specks of mica between the latter places i also found some masses of a steatitic rock mixed with trap which latter was much decomposed to some depth throughout the greater part of this district in several places the trap had a sandy appearance arising from the decomposition of clinkstone which dr macculloch observes frequently acquires an arenaceous aspect on the surface after exposure to the weather so as even to have been confounded with sandstone by incautious observers at pimento grove a coffee settlement between rio magno pen st thomasinthevale and tremolesworth st marys trap rocks are met with which apparently are continued from those above mentioned they here constitute mountains that rise among others of the white limestone formation which latter rests upon and covers the trap on the northeast and southwest the trap in the vicinity of pimento grove principally consists of greenstone and porphyry one singular variety of the latter composed of a dark claystone base studded with crystals of white felspar will be observed on the left hand side of the road having the porphyritic pieces or concretions rounded and separated from each other by a soft argillaceous substance among which strings of chalcedony are sometimes found the above is the only instance of this kind of structure that came under my observation while in jamaica with the exception of part of an extinct volcano to be mentioned hereafter here the porphyry is of a very common kind and is associated with greenstone porphyries one of these contains brownish red crystals of felspar and crystals of augite and another grayish white crystals of felspar with crystals of augite the last mineral being more abundant in the latter than in the former of these varieties in the neighbourhood of williamsfield and sandy gully st thomasinthevale greenstone and porphyry very much decomposed where exposed to the weather form the lower parts of the valley which has all the characters of a valley of denudation the higher parts of the mountains being capped by white limestones which seem once to have formed parts of the same mass this trappean country appears to be connected with that range of trap above described which extends from st davids north westerly into st marys its junction with it being concealed by the white limestone formation on the east of williamsfield c another portion of decomposed trap appears on the road between williamsfield and hampshire estates a small portion of porphyritic conglomerate occurs near mount sinai estate on the yallahs river being a continuation of the hope river porphyritic conglomerates on the southeast it is however greatly covered up on the yallahs river by the white limestone formation another extensive district of trap rocks constituting the principal part of the st johns mountains and extending westerly into clarendon occurs at a considerable distance from that which has been above described and is surrounded on all the sides which i have examined by the white limestone formation it however seems referrible to the same epoch of formation as that above noticed ascending the st johns mountains by the road from st dorothys rectory to luidas vale trap appears on the northern side of the river near mountain river estate forming the greater part of the mountain on which the barracks are placed greenstone and porphyry are here seen in general very much decomposed as is very commonly the case in the st johns mountains among these rocks i found a very finegrained greenstone as also a purplish brown rock apparently with a decomposed felspathic base in which were a few light greenish spots of decomposed felspar the porphyries are in such a state of decomposition to a considerable depth that their various bases cannot be distinguished without considerable difficulty i however met with one fragment having a blackish green claystone base with crystals of greenish white felspar this trap mountain is covered towards luidas vale by the white limestone formation which also occurs in patches upon it as may be seen at the barracks c a decomposed trap rock occurs at pleasant hill among these mountains and this spot is interesting as the trap can be observed almost in contact with the white limestone that bounds it on the northward and forms the slope of the mountain towards luidas vale that part of the st johns mountains which is represented on the map as composed of the rocks under consideration may be described as formed of various claystone porphyries greenstones and rocks approaching the basaltic character with various modifications of that rock of which says dr macculloch indurated clay or wacke may be placed at one extreme and compact felspar at the other the intermediate member being claystone and clinkstone these rocks pass into each other in such a manner that it is impossible to say what extent of country is occupied by any one they are well exposed on the juan de bolas great river forming picturesque cliffs of various heights on both banks considerable variety will be found in the vicinity of lemon hall estate on this river the porphyries are there principally composed of a dark claystone base with white crystals of felspar the base of some have the appearance of a finegrained greenstone and i observed one with a brownish red claystone base and reddish white crystals of felspar among the other trap rocks of this place i remarked a finegrained greenstonelooking rock containing small brilliant facets which effervesce and appear to be carbonate of lime the trap mountains of st johns attain considerable elevation and are formed into very sharp ridges winding considerably the course of the main ridges being about east and west the st johns trap extends into that part of clarendon which is principally drained by the mountain portion of the rio minho and the streams descending from the elevated land of which the bull head forms the highest part porphyritic conglomerate is seen stratified near savoy estate clarendon with a dip of a few degrees to the eastward the same rock which corresponds with the porphyritic conglomerate of the hope river is also found at morgans valley porphyry appears to be associated with the conglomerate near savoy estate a porphyry occurs near port antonio portland separating the white limestone from the submedial rocks but the manner in which it is exposed makes it difficult to refer it to any particular epoch of formation this rock will be observed not far from the town on the road to moore town a maroon town it consists of a reddish gray earthy claystone base with crystals of white felspar and crystals of augite not far from this there is another porphyry having a reddish brown claystone base containing small reddish crystals of felspar intermingled with moderately sized crystals of augite to this list may be added the earthy claystone rocks which are found in one part of the descent from monte diablo into st thomasinthevale and form some part of the southern face of that mountain among them may be seen a porphyritic rock composed of a light brown earthy base thinly sprinkled with white crystals of felspar from the information i received it would seem probable that trap forms the southern part of the mountain range which extends from monte diablo towards the northeastern part of st thomasin thevale superior or tertiary rocks to this order the white limestone formation which occupies such a considerable portion of jamaica would seem if we only take into consideration the character of its fossil organic remains in some measure referrihle still however i have many doubts upon the subject and therefore while i class it for the present under the above head i wish it to be understood as merely a temporary arrangement this formation is principally composed of white limestone varying consideiably in its texture which is most frequently very close and when so strongly resembling the compact varieties of the jura limestones such as they occur among the jura mountains and in the lower part of the mont saleve near geneva in fact specimens from the latter place and from some of the jamaica white limestones present scarcely any difference the white limestone of jamaica is not however taken generally of an homogeneous composition some parts of the same stratum being more argillaceous than others these latter parts becoming decomposed by the action of the atmosphere the surface is full of inequalities from which circumstance the name of homycomb rock is very generally applied to it by the jamaica colonists in consequence of the decomposed surface of the rock and the thick forests by which it is generally covered the stratification is often very difficult to determine the strata are moreover often of very considerable thicknessfrom to feet this compact white limestone is in some districts interstratified with thick beds of red marl and sandstone as also with white chalky marl the compact white limestone with its associated beds constitutes the main or middle part of the formation and contains organic remains generally casts beneath these limestones there are beds of sands and marls the latter containing fibrous gypsum and being often associated with bluish gray compact limestones sometimes traversed by veins of calcareous spar in this lower part of the formation there are beds of yellowish white limestone which are more earthy than the others and contain a greater abundance of organic remains among which a gigantic cerithium may be noticed together with echinites spines of echinites ostreae c some beds are principally composed of the remains of broken shells the upper beds of this formation are generally chalky sandy and marly still however many beds are very compact and in general texture and appearance agree with those of the central portion this upper part contains the fossil remains of the genera conus cerithium astarte natica c and near the sea coast in the parishes of st thomasintheeast portland st george and st mary a considerable quantity of corals which frequently have almost a recent appearance the following is a list of the fossil organic remains which i procured from the white limestone formation of jamaica this formation is of considerable depth in several places particularly in the parishes of manchester clarendon st ann st thomasinthevale and st david its thickness in some of these places cannot be less than from to feet in enumerating the localities of this formation i shall begin with the parish of manchester because that parish forms the southwestern portion of the part of jamaica which i propose to describe and moreover the middle of the formation can be well studied among its mountains the road from mount pleasant in clarendon over the mountains to new forest near alligator pond bay presents a great mixture of the compact white limestone with a red sandstone the latter seldom appears on the surface in an undecomposed state its place being very generally marked by a red marly soil the mass of these rocks has a southerly dip where the dense vegetation will permit an examination on the descent of plowden hill towards new forest compact white limestone is seen interstratified with rather compact red sandstone which contains nodules and stripes of the white limestone evidently of contemporaneous formation with it the beds are slightly curved and dip sometimes at at others at to the sw the neighbourhood of new forest near alligator pond bay presents singular mixtures of the white limestone with the red sandstone the most remarkable of these are found among the plains as they are called of st elizabeths included between the santa cruz mountains and those of manchester and terminating near alligator pond bay small patches of rock rising from ten to twenty feet above the level of the plain are abundantly scattered over its surface presenting at some distance the appearance of numerous clumps of trees distributed over an immense park these rocky patches are composed of compact white limestone and the rest of the plain principally of red sandstone thus giving to the former the appearance of the remains of continuous strata the greater part of which has been swept away this would in some measure seem the case for although the lower limestone strata of these rocky patches are often much intermingled with the red sandstone and are evidently of contemporaneous formation with it still the upper strata terminate so suddenly that there is some reason for believing that they once extended to a much greater distance than they do at present thus making it probable that the patches formed continuous strata which have in a great measure been destroyed by denudation in the same manner as is shown by the larger masses of rock found isolated in other parts of the world these patches may also be accounted for by supposing the white limestone patches to have been included among the red sandstone strata in the same manner as smaller portions are now seen in the same neighbourhood so that when the plains were formed into their present state the red sandstone which was softer than the limestone may be supposed to have given way before the causes which have produced most of the present inequalities in the earths surface while the limestone was left i observed that the white limestone beds of many of these patches had a slight dip to the s w the intimate mixture of red sandstone and white limestone in the neighbourhood of new forest occurs frequently in the same strata and in such a manner as would make it most difficult to be accounted for except by the theory of contemporaneous formation there are however other mixtures of the two substances which must have had a different origin such as the breccias and conglomerates in the same district these are composed of either fragments or rounded pieces of white limestone but principally of the latter cemented by red sandstone or an arenaceous substance of a lighter colour approaching to yellowish brown and presenting much the same appearance as the cementing matter of some magnesian or dolomitic conglomerates it does not however contain any magnesia for dr daubeny to whom i gave specimens for examination states that not one of them contains any appreciable quantity of magnesia the pieces of white limestone are so much rounded in the conglomerate that they appear to have been derived from the forcible destruction of some of the beds by water anterior to the formation of a considerable portion of the jamaica white limestone the red arenaceous rock mixed with the limestone near new forest is in a great measure calcareous the white limestone of this place varies in its degree of hardness but is principally compact in one instance i observed it of a crystalline structure with thin spathose divisions quitting the plain or savannah abovementioned and ascending marlbro hill white limestone will be seen dipping to the sw the may day hills are composed of a mixture of white limestone red sandstone and white marls which are continued down the beautiful valley with the inharmonious name of mile gully a name moreover altogether inappropriate as applied to this valley which is many miles long and any thing but a gully the general dip of the whole limestone formation of manchester appears to be at various angles to the sw the round hill in vere is formed of a continuation of the manchester white limestones and is remarkable for the warm saline spring that rises out of the limestone near its base at the place called the bath the white limestone formation would indeed seem in some measure saliferous for salt is found in the long mountain near kingston produced apparently by the evaporation of saline dippings from the rockf among the limestones of the bath in vere is one of a roseate fleshcolour which might be made useful for ornamental purposes the mocho mountains in clarendon are composed of the same rocks as those of manchester the red sandstone being much more scarce the stratification of the mocho mountain limestones is in general difficult to determine from the thickness of the forests by which they are covered and from the decomposed surface of the beds which are often honeycombed to a considerable depth the traverse over these mountains by the rock road exposes a considerable quantity of compact white limestone the beds of which would seem to vary from to feet in thickness for i observed blocks that must have belonged to rocks of at least the latter size between the higher part of the road and four paths estate white marls come in and are succeeded by a yellowish and rather arenaceous rock effervescing with acids the glen through which the road winds to halse hall crawle presents cliffs in which the white limestones appear to dip to the southward at about an angle of in two or three places on the ascent red sandstone will be observed interstratified with the white limestone and at the crawle itself i found casts of univalves and bivalves in the limestone we find the lower beds of this formation in the neighbourhood of chapelton clarendon between which place and four paths estate abovementioned the road exposes white marl which is followed by whitish friable sand mixed with gray and a little red marl these beds dip to the nne at about at chapelton a whitish calcareous marl contains portions of yellowish limestone full of broken fossil shells some of which may be easily recognised as of the ostrea genus among these rocks i found specimens of the large cerithium formerly mentioned lower down the hill upon which chapelton stands white limestones mixed with white marls and sands some of which are red continue to where the whole formation seems to rest upon porphyritic conglomerate on the road to savoy estate a reddish and white smallgrained conglomerate the pebbles in which are mostly porphyritic rests upon the other and may either belong to the lower part of the white limestone formation or the upper portion of the porphyritic conglomerate the barquadier road from chapelton to the plains of clarendon shows that the limestones of that part of the mocho mountains dip at the first part of the descent at an angle of to the e by s and further down at about to the se these limestones are continued to lime savannah between which place and denbigh estate in a woody part of the road not far from the former a smallgrained conglomerate is interstratified with them the pebbles of which are principally quartzose the white limestone formation is continued from the mocho mountains across the rio minho and forms the mountains on the left bank of the river which gradually fall into the low hills which separate the plains of clarendon and vere from that of st dorothys and are continued to the sea in old harbour bay these low hills are also composed of the same formation exhibiting a mixture of compact white limestone and white and red marls the latter being frequently traversed in different directions by white calcareous matter in the rising behind halse hall house clarendon which forms a part of these low hills white marl rests upon compact white limestone among which there is a breccia composed of fragments of compact white limestone cemented by a yellowishbrown arenaceous and calcareous substance in the white limestone behind halse hall house i found a nautilus terebratulae and nummulites with numerous casts of the genera area astarte cardita cerithium c and abundant casts of astreae the beds dip to the wsw at about kemps hill which rises out of the diluvial plain of vere is formed of white limestone as is also the hill named portland ridge the most southern part of vere and of jamaica the connexion of these hills with the white limestones of manchester clarendon and vere is concealed and covered up bv diluvial and alluvial plains the formation under consideration is continued from clarendon into st dorothys and st johns forming a considerable portion of the mountains in the latter parish at wood hall estate in the former parish it is found close to the trap upon which it seems to rest and from which it is separated by marl beds from hence to the southward the hills are composed of compact white limestone mixed with red sandstone and white marl the dip observable on the road to old harbour varies and shows that the strata undulate the most prevalent is however to the southward away from the trap the small hill upon which the rectory stands near old harbour is composed of white limestone proceeding from the latter place to the rectory of st johns we find the white limestone at spring garden hill dipping at about an angle of to the sw at hollow rock hill it is mixed with red sandstone and from thence to st johns rectory it is associated with red sandstone and red marl traversed by numerous veins of whitish calcareous matter the two latter rocks predominating the compact white limestone is more abundant between st johns rectory and mountain river estate where it meets the trap patches of it are however seen near the barracks after which it appears in considerable force on the descent into luidas vale among the beds in the latter situation there are some resembling those of chapelton principally composed of broken shells these beds are also mixed with marls and dip at about to the s the white limestone formation seems here much confused in one place it dips slightly to the northward and in another at from to to the sw so that it would be difficult from this section to say whether the limestone rests upon the trap or the latter forms a dyke amid the former by reference to the map it will be seen that the limestone formation occurring in manchester clarendon vere and st dorothy winds round the eastern extremity of the trappean district which separates the abovementioned limestones from those of st anns c for a considerable distance thus the white limestone on the north of st johns becomes connected with that on the s although it may seem out of place to notice fine scenery amid a dry detail of geological facts yet that traveller must be indeed dead to the beauties of nature who would not be struck with the fine and picturesque effect produced by the first burst of luidas vale in his descent from the barracks this beautiful spot would be a lake but for the subterraneous channels the waters find for themselves it is on every side surrounded by mountains broken into a series of fine forms and covered with forests while the bottom of the vale presents a mixture of buildings and canefields the brilliant green of the latter contrasting finely with the other colours the scenery of jamaica is generally fine varying from the beautiful to the grand and such as can only be seen in the tropics for there alone is found that vegetation which gives such a peculiar character to the landscape the hills and mountains surrounding luidas vale are composed of white limestone the strata of which have various dips among the small hills on the north the dip is gently to the se while it will be found to the n by e at an angle of from to among the mountains that bound the vale on the south where the limestone joins the trap near pleasant hill the same kind of limestones appear from beneath diluvium near worthy park estate which is situated nearly in the centre of the vale the principal subterraneous water passage of luidas vale is to the east of thetford estate where the river flows beneath a high mountain and reappears on the other side of it giving rise to the black river as it is denominated in robertsons maps in st thomasinthevale the waters lose themselves in many places in this vale among others close to the works of worthy park where the water brought from a considerable distance turns the great wheel and is swallowed up close to it it may here be remarked that the white limestone formation of jamaica is characterized by being hollowed into innumerable holes and caverns among which the waters which fall in the districts composed of it are lost hence arises the general scarcity of springs in that part of jamaica principally composed of these rocks and the necessity the inhabitants of such parts are under of making tanks to preserve a supply of water the portions of country occupied by the white limestone formation are in a great measure shown upon a good map of jamaica robertsons small map for instance by a great want of rivers while the latter are numerous in the districts composed of other rocks some rivers will be found to flow for a short distance and then sink sometimes coming again to the surface and again sinking several springs flow only for a very short space being received into some cavity the white limestone of luidas vale is continued into the large parish of st ann which seems almost wholly composed of rocks of this formation presenting there a mixture of compact white limestones earthy limestones white marls and beds of red sandstone many large casts of bivalves are found in this formation about a mile and a half from green park on the road to the moneague this parish affords many good sections among which may be mentioned the cliffs between ocho rios bay and the roaring river the st anns limestone is continued into st marys and st thomasinthevale the space that it occupies will be best seen by reference to the map in the former parish besides the component parts of this formation which have been above enumerated the shores present us with a rock composed of either white or fleshcoloured limestone mixed with marl and containing an abundance of corals intermingled with shells the former when broken having almost the appearance of recent specimens i could not perceive that these beds were separated in any marked manner from the other white limestones which they resemble in mineralogical composition on the contrary they seem to pass into them and to form the upper part of the great white limestone formation of jamaica these beds are observable on the coast in the vicinity of ora cabessa bay and constitute the point upon which fort haldane stands the island opposite port maria pagee point and several small patches on the coast from the latter place to forsters cove where the points on both sides are formed of them they here dip at about or to the n and are separated from the grauwacke by thick conglomerate beds which also have the same dip on the road up to a house on the western side of the cove the corals are beautifully exposed these beds are also found at blowing point don christophers point and in the vicinity of jacks bay at the former places they are generally white and compact sometimes of a fleshcolour and do not contain so many corals as at the latter place where the limestone forms a rising ground some little distance into the interior between palmetto grove st marys and pimento grove and to the north of the trap rocks of the latter place the lower marls of the white limestone formation are seen containing some beds of compact grayish blue limestone the high hill between palmetto grove and tremolesworth also exposes the lower members of this formation in which the marls are abundant the continuation of this hill running to the nw appears formed of the same rocks proceeding with the continuation of this formation into st thomasinthevale we find the lower marls which are sometimes schistose in the vicinity of pimento grove and on the southern side of the trap in that district from hence to rio magno pen the limestone will be observed in great abundance the hills on either side of williamsfield and sandy gully estates are formed of compact white limestone resting upon trap rocks the strata as before remarked appearing to have been once continuous and the whole looking like a valley of denudation the mountains that surround the great basin of st thomasinthevale are almost all composed of the white limestone formation and the basin itself would seem convertible into a large lake if the ravine through which the rio cobre flows called the walks road between the bog walk and spanish town were stopped up upon mount olive estate in this parish there is a singular natural bridge formed of compact white limestone a small river flowing in a precipitous ravine is crossed by a natural arch beneath which it runs see plate xx this natural bridge is lofty and of sufficient breadth at the top to permit a cartroad over it which has accordingly been established if it were not for the arch the water would be blocked up by this natural wall or barrier the cliffs rising high and precipitous on either side and preventing its escape laterally the cavernous nature of this limestone is curiously shown on the same property by the manner in which the water is procured to turn the waterwheel a rivulet runs on the side of the hill opposite to that on which the works are placed and to obtain water for the mill the rivulet is dammed up at a given place when it finds its way through the hill rushes out of a hole near the works and turns the wheel the walks road ravine exposes a good section of compact white limestone and white marl beds the former are seen varying in thickness and dipping to the sw or ssw near the opening of the defile into the basin of st thomasinthevale the formation under consideration forms the mountains on the north of the diluvial and alluvial plain of st catherines and constitutes small hills rising out of it close to spanish town and on the road to kingston a white chalky marl is exposed on the same road between the former place and the ferry the healthshire hills and the hill that rises above port henderson opposite port royal are also composed of the same rocks the mountains which join the elevated land of stony hill with those of st catherines and which bound the plain of liguanea for a considerable distance on the north belong to this formation on the southern ascent to stony hill compact white limestone in some places associated with red sandstone dips to the s s e on the lower part of the descent from the same hill to the agua alta light coloured marls and sands separate the great hody of this formation from the porphyritic conglomerate on which it rests the white limestone is continued but a short distance eastward from stony hill i have however observed a small portion of it resting upon syenite near somerset estate the long mountain situated to the n e of kingston rises principally from beneath diluvial gravel and is wholly formed of white limestone the dip is difficult to trace yet markings may here and there be observed which would seem to make it probable that it is to the sw the most remarkable thing in this mountain is the salt procured above a pen belonging to mrs clark sometimes in sufficient quantities to be used at table it is found in a small recess and appears to be derived from the evaporation of saline water which percolates through the marly limestone of the place from the long mountain this formation is continued into those of the port royal mountains which approach the sea and a good section is afforded of its beds up the valley of the cane river to the cascade the white limestone is at first observed at the latter place in rather thin beds dipping to the n e at a highly inclined angle higher up the valley the beds become thicker and dip to the sw at from to near the falls the beds are almost perpendicular from the various inclinations of the strata they appear to have been much disturbed in this vicinity from the valley of the cane river a belt of the white limestone formation varying in breadth and separating the older rocks of the interior from the sea runs round the coast from the south to the north side of the island by the east end and passes through the parishes of st david st thoinasintheeast portland and st georges the lower part of the valley of the yallahs river presents a good section of the st davids portion ascending the river from albion estate compact white limestone beds are seen near norris dipping to sse at about they will also be observed curved on the face of the cliffs which for some distance up are formed of this rock on both sides the river approaching mount sinai estate the lower beds of the formation are exhibited by the road side and in a great measure correspond with those occurring near chapelton clarendon with the exception that the sands do not seem so abundant whereas the marls are more so among the lower white limestone beds which are slightly earthy and arenaceous i found many organic remains among them echinites cidaris and spatangus spines of echinites ostreae mye and cerithia of the latter genus besides a smaller species i met with the gigantic one figured in plate xxi and which is also found in a similar situation at chapelton beneath these beds there is a succession of gray and light coloured marls among which i discovered fibrous gypsum and thick beds of compact gray blue limestone the whole resting upon porphyritic conglomerate near mount sinai white limestone beds from one foot to three feet in thickness have a curved dip to the sse between norris and lloyds upon vavasers river marl limestone and slaty beds of the lower part of this formation are seen from the latter place up the valley of the back river to the ridge that descends from yallahs hill and separates st davids from st thomasintheeast this connecting ridge or col as it would be called in savoy or the french alps occurs between the petersfield and back rivers and presents a mixture of white marl brown sandstone slate clay and gray marl with gray and white limestones in beds nearly vertical having a direction about ne and sw yellowish sandstone should also be added to this list the white limestone formation of st thomasintheeast comes close up to the submedial country between spring garden and bath and between the former place and whitehall estate upon the plantain garden river white limestone associated with red marly sandstone rests upon argillaceous slate the low hills on the south of plantain garden river between whitehall and sunning hill are composed of white sandstone and marl mixed with reddish sandstone beds of gravel and coarse sandstone are found near golden valley the relations of which to the rocks of the surrounding country i did not clearly ascertain but they seem to occur beneath the white limestone formation the low hills extending to the sea on the south of bath are composed of the white chalky marl portion of this formation and might easily be mistaken for some varieties of chalk these hills which reach to the great morass near morant point are separated from the white limestone on the north of plantain garden river by the diluvial and alluvial plain rich in sugar estates which extends from the mouth of the river to beyond bath and most probably conceals the junction of the limestone on the south with that on the north the white limestone that forms the coast from the north of wheelersfield hordleys amity hall and holland estates round the northeast point to port antonio presents an association of compact white limestone and white marl mixed occasionally with some red at manchioneal harbour the white marl contains corals spines of echinites and terebratulae besides casts of other shells throughout the whole of this coast the white marl is the predominating member of the formation and most of the low points which are numerous contain an abundance of corals which have almost a recent appearance when fractured resembling those formerly mentioned as occurring at forsters cove st marys the dip of this limestone and marl is either e ne or nne according to its bearing with the interior of this part of the island round which it mantles on the eastern side of turtle crawle bay a sandy and chalky rock is worked for buildingstones which are used at port antonio the white limestones and marls of which latter place rest upon porphyry from port antonio to burlington near the mouth of the rio grande the coast is formed of white limestone and marl the latter being sometimes sandy the beds of the former dipping northerly at the cliffs near the ford over the rio grande good sections are afforded of this formation in st georges by the swift great spanish and buff bay rivers it extends up the former to eden estate and both sides of the river present fine cliffs of the rocks under consideration the white limestones extend up the great spanish river to about half a mile or more above skibo the beds varying in thickness and being contorted near the latter place the road from canewood to low layton estate between the mouths of the swift and great spanish rivers is upon white sandy marl and limestone but to the northward of lennox and rising above low layton the country is composed of volcanic rocks this formation continues up the buff bay river for about a mile above charles town the beds varying in thickness and dipping northerly being however curved in some places the hills that back the low flat between annotto bay and buff bay are composed of white limestones and marls the extent of country occupied by them between the sea and the older rocks gradually becoming narrower as we approach the former place in one spot between these two villages i found nodules of chert in the white marl from which circumstance it appears probable that the loose pieces of chert scattered over the surface in some parts of st marys parish as for instance in the neighbourhood of islington estate and in the diluvial soil between unity and nonsuch estates and port maria may have been derived from the destruction of some beds of the white limestone formation and this supposition is rendered more probable by finding pieces of compact white limestone scattered over the surface of the submedial or transition country between nonsuch estate and port maria savannah conglomerate and sandstone next in order to the white limestone formation may be mentioned a sandstone and a conglomerate that rest upon it and which i have named as above because i have most frequently seen them among savannahs these rocks will be found at the base of the mocho mountains clarendon forming the commencement of the large plain of lower clarendon and vere st jagos savannah extending to these mountains is principally composed of the sandstone which is light coloured and friable from hence the sandstone and conglomerate sweep round by burnt savannah to halse hall and hays savannahs skirting the white limestone hills and separating them from diluvium and alluvium at halse hall the conglomerate is composed of rounded pieces of various porphyries and trap rocks cemented by a dirty white argillaceous substance and mixed with carnelians agates chalcedonies onyxes and jaspers the latter minerals are by no means rare in the conglomerate hill to the south of halse hall works clarendon in the watercourses among the abovementioned savannahs there is an abundance of magnetic iron sand this mineral is indeed common in several parts of jamaica but not so much so i think as among the savannah sandstones and conglomerates the same sandstones and conglomerates will be observed resting upon the white limestone formation in several places on the road from halse hall to old harbour these rocks occur in other parts of jamaica but in no great abundance in that portion which i have selected for description diluvium and alluvium it is gratifying to find professor bucklands distinctions so well borne out in a country far removed from those places where they were originally made and to see that the same cause which broke up the surface of european countries reducing its harder portions into gravel has also affected jamaica in a similar manner the divisions into diluvium and alluvium are too well known to require any notice here i shall therefore proceed to describe those places in jamaica where i have observed them the first district which i shall notice is the great plain of liguanea upon the lower part of which kingston is situated this plain presents an inclined surface falling gradually from a height of about feet which it attains where it abuts against the mountains that bound it on the north it is almost wholly composed of diluvial gravel consisting principally of the detritus of the st andrews and port royal mountains and evidently produced by causes not now in action but derived from those mountains in the same manner and probably at the same period with the numerous tracts of european gravel which have resulted from the partial destruction of european rocks the mountains which bound this plain are composed of white limestone porphyry syenite greenstone red porphyritic conglomerate and siliceous sandstones with red sandstones and conglomerates of an older date rounded pieces of all these rocks those of the first being however very rare form the diluvial gravel of liguanea which has resulted from their partial destruction though the pebbles are not in general of great size there are some large blocks of siliceous sandstone among them near the hope estate and i have seen boulders of greenstone near the base of the long mountain the hope river with the mammee river which falls into it drains a considerable portion of the st andrews mountains and loses itself when the waters are low among the liguanea gravels where the latter meet the solid strata of the mountains but when swollen by heavy tropical rains the river rushes with considerable force through the defile near the hope tavern and traverses the gravel plain which it has cut to a considerable depth so that in fact the causes now in action tend to destroy the diluvial gravel plain of liguanea rather than add to it the section of these gravels which the river has formed by cutting its bed cannot be less than from to feet in depth near the hope tavern proceeding up the hope valley a part of the road displays a portion of diluvium the rounded pieces of rock in which are large resting upon a projecting portion or shoulder of the mountain which rises high above the river in addition to the hope river numerous gullies formed by heavy tropical rains cut the diluvial plain of liguanea in various directions so that every stream that traverses it tends to destroy it this plain descending gradually into the sea and being in a great measure defended from the ravages of the latter by the palisades a sandbank that extends several miles and joins the town of port royal with the main land alluvial matter is deposited in some parts of the shore more particularly between kingston and port henderson where mangrove trees are numerous these trees are particularly well calculated for the formation of alluvium their long stiltlike roots collecting mud and other matters together and protecting what they have accumulated from any sudden rush of water the diluvial plain of liguanea is continued westward through the lowlands of st catherines and st dorothys sands and clays are more abundant in these districts but in other respects the diluvium is the same the sections afforded by the rivers and gullies are of considerable interest though there is no one so deep as that of the hope river bones of the elephant rhinoceros c have certainly not yet been discovered in the jamaica gravels but it should be recollected that the opportunities for such discoveries are by no means so common as in those countries where gravel is extensively used for roads c the climate moreover is such that few feel tempted to risk their health by prosecuting researches of this nature the large plain of vere and lower clarendon is separated from the above by the low range of white limestone hills formerly mentioned it is surrounded by white limestone hills and mountains on all sides save on the south and southeast where it is washed by the sea with the exception of that portion protected by portland ridge the greater part of this plain is diluvial consisting of gravels clays and sands the former are principally composed of porphyry greenstone and other trap rock pebbles that would appear to have been in a great measure derived from the partial destruction of the trap districts among the st johns and clarendon mountains many good sections are afforded of this diluvium by the rio minho which traverses it nearly through its whole length as also by many deep gullies it is easy to remark here as in liguanea that the causes now m action tend to destroy this plain and are altogether inadequate to its formation it is remarkable that though the diluvium of this district is nearly surrounded by white limestone hills and mountains very few fragments of this rock are found in it from which circumstance it would appear that the limestones though in general tolerably compact were unable to resist the effects of violent attrition so well as the greenstones porphyries c the vere and clarendon diluvium rests for some distance upon the savannah sandstones and conglomerates before mentioned and it is often very difficult to distinguish between them diluvium occurs at the bottom of luidas vale and in some parts of st thomasinthevale and mixed with alluvium it forms a considerable tract of low land between annotto and buff bays as might be expected the mouths of the rivers are alluvial but some of the country about welsh womans point and whydah bay between the rio grande and daniels river portland appears to be diluvial as may also be part of the gravels occurring in the plain from bath st thomasintheeast to the sea through this plain the plantain garden river flows most of the gravels in the neighbourhood of serge island estate st thomasintheeast seem also to belong to the same epoch of formation as connected with the subject it may be as well to notice the valleys of the white limestone formation which completely oppose themselves to the theory that valleys have been formed by the waters now flowing in them for no waters flow in the greater part of those hollowed out of this formation the limestone being as before mentioned extremely cavernous and the rains that fall being speedily swallowed up in it yet these valleys are as to form like most other valleys and probably owe their origin to the same causes which have produced the greater part of those in the chalk oolites c of england at the period when diluvial gravel was formed in jamaica where so many caverns exist ample opportunities are without doubt afforded of seeing whether or not they contain the remains of animals that existed before the diluvial or great gravel period of the larger caverns i only visited two one in luidas vale and the other in portland ridge vere the first is situated near swansea estate and winds considerably the bottom is in some places formed of clay but i have not heard that any bones have ever been found in it the second or portland cave reminded me of professor bucklands cave sections in one place where a crust of stalagmite covers silty clay but whether or not the latter contains bones i could not ascertain from the want of the necessary implements how far this stalagmitic crust which is of some thickness formerly extended it would be difficult to say hundreds of people having visited this cavern as their names scrawled upon the wall with charcoal testify and the floor in consequence as may be reasonably inferred not presenting the same appearance as when the cavern was first entered the cave is situated on the side of a hill within a short distance from the sea but it is sufficiently elevated to prevent the possibility of the clay having been derived from the sea at its present level volcanic rocks in that part of jamaica which examined i observed rocks of this character only at the black hill which is situated between lennox low layton and the sea st georges this hill when viewed from the neighbourhood of buff bay has a somewhat conical appearance and rises above the low hills that extend towards savannah point the hill however when approached is seen to be no cone notwithstanding its effect at a distance the rock of which the black hill is principally composed is grayish brown and hard gives out an earthy smell when breathed on and may in general terms be described as a volcanic amygdaloid the cells with which it abounds being mostly filled those however which have been exposed to the weather are frequently empty as are also those within a few inches from the surface the interior of the empty cells is often incrusted with a little oxyd of iron while those that are full and convert the rock into an amygdaloid contain chalcedony carbonate of lime and occasionally some of the zeolitic minerals in general chalcedony lines the cavity and the central part is composed of carbonate of lime this rock when the cells are empty has a very lavalike appearance and the greater part of it which is exposed is arranged in concretions reminding the observer of the porphyry at pimento grove these concretions are separated from each other by a white argillaceous substance which is in considerable abundance in one or two places on ascending the hill it becomes more rare or at least is not so easily seen as on the coast where cliffs of volcanic amygdaloid rise above the sea near the summit of the black hill i found the rock changed in several places into a substance between obsidian and pumice having however more the character of the latter than of the former and presenting every appearance of having been subjected to the action of fire at no very distant period geologically speaking i also found some pieces of rock changed on the surface into this kind of obsidianpumice which in the interior were claystone porphyries having a dark coloured base with white crystals of felspar the connexion of this hill with the sandy marl member of the white limestone formation which surrounds it on all sides but that of the sea is very obscure some gravel beds will however be observed close to it as it is approached from the mouth of the swift river the black hill would seem referrible to what are commonly called extinct volcanos how many more of them there may be in jamaica i had no means of ascertaining though probably others may exist more particularly in the western portion of the island respecting the geology of which i could obtain little or no information except that the white limestone is very com mon explanation of the sections plate xix in the preceding pages i have given little more than a detailed account of the composition of the jamaica rocks and the extent of country occupied by them touching but slightly on the sections which show their relative positions conceiving that these would be better thrown together after the composition of the formations had been described commencing then with the section from kingston over st georges gap to buff bay plate xix fig we find the liguanea diluvium forming an inclined plane from kingston to the base of the mountains on the north of somerset estate where a few patches of compact white limestone separate it from the syenite ascending towards st georges gap the lower mountains are found to be formed of syenite for some distance to this succeeds a conglomerate composed of porphyry and other trap rock pebbles having a brownish red argillaceous cement and occurring in beds of various thickness the dip being southerly the conglomerate has the appearance of supporting the syenite in one or two places i observed greenstone associated with the conglomerate and beneath the latter there is a light coloured sandstone similar to that found near the coal measures on the hope river this is succeeded by the red sandstones and conglomerates which may in some measure be considered as equivalent to our old red sandstone they dip sw near the summit of the gap upon the northern descent from this place there are beds very mucli resembling those of the southern side but these latter red sandstones and conglomerates are associated with grauwacke and dip to the ne from hence passing down the valley of the buff bay river we find that all the rocks dip more or less to the northward while those on the south of the gap dip more or less to the southward the submedial or transition country which comes in to the northward of st georges gap continues nearly to charles town and is composed of the rocks enumerated under the proper head approaching the town the grauwacke passes into red sandstone and conglomerate and the latter support the white limestone formation which extends nearly to the sea the section from the sea near kingston by half way tree stony hill barracks and scots hall maroon town to forsters cove st marys plate xix fig exposes nearly the same rocks as the above the diluvial gravel abuts against the base of stony hill which is composed of the white limestone formation dipping to the southward this limestone is separated from the porphyritic conglomerate upon which it rests by light coloured sands and marls as may be observed on the descent to the agua alta or wag water these are succeeded by a great mass of various trap rocks among which i here and there observed in the bed of the agua alta some conglomerate beds composed of trappean pebbles cemented by a trappean substance this trap seems to rest upon the red sandstone and conglomerate beds that pass into grauwacke to the northward of scots hall maroon town from thence grauwacke continues across st marys parish to the sea near forsters cove where some of the upper beds of the white limestone formation rest upon it the section from old harbour to luidas vale fig shows the connexion of the trap mountains in st johns with the white limestone formation on the north and south of it the alluvial and diluvial plain of st dorothys continues to the base of the white limestone hills near the rectory which is itself situated upon a small white limestone hill that rises out of the plain the white limestone dips southerly and continues to wood hall estate where it dips from and apparently rests on the trap the latter afterwards forms the mountains to mount pleasant situated on the mountain that rises to the south of luidas vale here the white limestone again comes in and rests upon trap rocks the beds now however dip at a considerable angle to the north appearing as if they were forced up into their present position by the trap and a glance at the section will show that the trap has very much the appearance of having been protruded through the white limestone formation which it will be seen returns to its southerly dip on the north side of luidas vale the limestone may have been deposited on the trap though it is somewhat difficult to conceive how strata inclined like those between mount pleasant and luidas vale could have been formed by deposition from a fluid geologists are well aware how difficult it is to refer trap rocks to any particular epoch of formation i have therefore not attempted to make any distinctions in this respect between the trap of the st johns mountains and that extending through the parishes of port royal and st andrews into st marys in fact the trap rocks of the two districts very nearly resemble each other and in both cases appear from beneath the white limestone formation the next section to be noticed is that from the sea over the long mountain and up the valley of the hope river to catherines peak fig a sandbank the palisades protects the branch of the sea forming kingston harbour on the north of which in our line of section rises the long mountain composed of white limestone dipping southerly and separated by a little diluvium from the sea between the long mountain and the mountain on the north of the hope estate we meet with part of the diluvium of the liguanea plain this abuts against the porphyritic conglomerate which forms the gorge of the hope river valley near the hope tavern and is continued up the valley to nearly opposite the botanical garden where the rocks which i have described as resembling coalmeasures occur beneath it to these succeed a red and gray conglomerate mixed with light coloured sandstones among which a compact gray limestone is found very much resembling the carboniferous limestone of the english series beneath these are the red sandstones and conglomerates which i have stated may be equivalent to our old red sandstones the rocks of the summit of catherines peak upon which the above rest seem to be submedial or transition and are formed of argillaceous slate limestone and gray sandstones these dip northerly as may be seen near clifton feet above the sea and the northern side of catherines peak comparison of the jamaica rocks with those described by m von humboldt in mexico and south america which appear to resemble them transition or submedial rocksthe jamaica rocks of this class can be said very little to resemble those described as occurring in quito and peru by humboldt in his essai sur le gisement des roches dans les deux hemispheres wherein he states that an immense formation of transition porphyry replaces the grauwacke in those places and that it is associated with syenite and greenstone we have seen under the head of trap rocks associated with the jamaica submedial or transition rocks that porphyries syenites greenstones c are by no means rare on the southern side of the blue mountain range but these rocks do not replace the grauwacke on the contrary they are associated with it and taking into consideration the mass of the jamaica transition rocks the grauwacke and limestones are much more abundant than the trap the transition rocks of mexico which humboldt has classed under his group and which he composes of transition slate containing grauwacke greenstone dark coloured limestones syenites and porphyries would seem more to resemble the jamaica transition rocks for the latter might be classed in this division redsandstone gres rouge the rocks which i have described
