slopes on either side are covered by low brushwood and afford occasional pasture to a flock of goats and some cattle belonging to proprietors resident in ponza the geological constitution of this island is singular since above two thirds of its mass is composed of trachyte which rests at the north point upon limestone the former rock is extremely siliceous and identical with that of la gabbia and the northern portion of ponza exhibiting the same intimate mixture of concretionary ramifications haying a flinty texture and a more or less porphyritic structure with white earthy patches it is associated in the same manner with marbled and brecciated masses assuming a great diversity of textures and colours in the same block the white porphyritic trachyte with crystals of quartz is however the predominant rock and composes in particular the mass which immediately overlies the limestone of the capo negro the mica which is here abundant in some parts of the rock has decomposed to a certain depth from the weathered surfaces into a reddish ochre the felspar is brilliant and the base extremely siliceous and of a pure white this rock is occasionally divided into tangled groups of very regular columns varying in size but sometimes as small as those of the earthy prismatic trachyte in ponza in its general character however it presents a singularly rude shapeless and craggy outline and all the external features of burrstone the decomposition of the mica and corrosion of the earthy parts giving a cellular and carious aspect to its superficial parts it is possible that some of the columnar groups which i observed on the eastern side of the island may consist of earthy trachyte but as the shores of the trachytic portion present few vertical sections of any considerable surface and are rendered otherwise difficult of access by heaps of enormous detached blocks which prevent the approach of a boat with any swell except on a few points it is not easy to put every rock of the island to the test of the hammer my examination was also limited in time by the rapid approach of a burrasca which drove me hastily back to the port of ponza for shelter the boundaryline of the limestone and superposed trachyte is effectually concealed on either side by a large talus of debris the limestone is of a bluish gray colour hard of semicrystalline grain and intersected by numerous veins of calcareous spar which constitute a large proportion of the mass i could find no organic remains it has all the characters of transition limestone and appears to correspond with that of the monte circello a vast mountainous rock once the island of circe but now united to the continent by the flat levels of the pomptine marshes which rises exactly opposite zannone at a distance of miles and has been described by brocchi as differing from the ordinary apennine limestone and decidedly transition the fragment of this rock which forms the capo negro in zannone exhibits highly inclined strata directed w n w by e s e and dipping towards the italian coast the loose blocks which have fallen from this limestone rock towards its junction with the trachyte and make up the talus by which the line of contact is hidden differ in character from the rock which forms the extreme point of capo negro their colour is a dark reddishgray approaching to black they are no longer traversed by calcareous spar veins effervesce with the greatest difficulty and appear to the lens to consist entirely of a close aggregation of cubical crystals which are most perfect within the fissures and small cellular cavities that penetrate the rock there can therefore be little doubt that the limestone has been converted into dolomite to a certain distance from its contact with the overlying trachyte to the protrusion of which it is difficult not to attribute the elevation of this insulated fragment of a transition formation the frequent repetition of an analogous circumstance in the alps where enormous masses of alpine limestone are rendered crystalline and penetrated with magnesia by the proximity of augitic basalt and a secondary granite with which it is associated may be urged in support of this hypothesis scoglio della botte a peaked insular rock which has acquired this name from the rude resemblance of its form to a boot rises above the sealevel at about a third of the distance from ponza to ventotiene it is composed of graystone similar to that of the montagna della guardia in the former island exceedingly compact hard and tough of a coarse crystalline or gran i to idal texture the crystals being almost solely of felspar with a deep purplish gray tinge the visible crystals of augite are few small and imperfect the mass of the rock is split into rude prismatic blocks it is superficially coated by a thin pellicle of a blackish colour like a dull and poor varnish which i conceive to be analogous to the black glazing observed by humboldt to invest the surface of the granitic rocks of the cataracts of the orinoco and apparently produced by long exposure to sun and moisture beneath this the rock is remarkably unaffected by decomposition perhaps because the process of mechanical abrasion by the violence of the waves which break upon it advances more rapidly than the chemical influence of the atmosphere in calm weather the base of this rock may be seen to extend at no great depth below the surface of the water to considerable distances in most directions but particularly towards the west there can be little doubt indeed that it is the solitary remnant of a mucli more extensive mass and is indebted forpreservation to its extreme solidity without which it must have been long ago swept away by the powerful forces of destruction by which in so exposed a situation it is almost without intermission attacked ventotiene this island is removed considerably to the eastward of the group already described lying nearly at equal distances from ponza and ischia upon a straight line which may be imagined to connect them its area has nearly the form of an acute rectangular triangle the base which is about four miles in length running east and west and the ohtuser angle pointing to the north the surface has one general slope from the summit of the capo del arco a bluff promontory which forms the acute and western angle to the eastern side where a small port almost the only landing place in the island is excavated from the indurated tufa rock a cluster of habitations is grouped around it with the exception of this one point the island is circumscribed by perpendicular cliffs its physical structure is of the simplest character and corresponds exactly with that of the island of procida and of the neighbouring hills which are so closely grouped together in the volcanic district included between naples pozzuoli cumae and aversa and which are generally known to geologists under the name of the phlegraean fields the island consists of parallel and wavy strata of yellow and brownish tufa resting upon a massive bed of graystone which rises to a height of more than feet above the sea at the extremity of the capo del arco and sinks gradually towards the east below the water level though the remainder of the island exhibits no rock but tufa this slanting bed is without doubt prolonged beneath it and supplies the solid foundation of the entire mass indeed the graystone which disappears on the south side at less than half its length from the eastern promontory is visible throughout the whole of the northwestern side this rock is of a dark violet or purplish gray finegrained and compact strikes fire readily with steel and contains small imbedded crystals of felspar augite and mica the upper part at the capo del arco is cellular and even scoriform at the surface of the bed the lower is amorphous or split into massive blocks by irregular fissures which are evidently but the result of the retreat that accompanied its consolidation the external surfaces of the rock are exceedingly darkcoloured almost indeed black and this sombre colouring together with its harsh forms give an unpleasing and savage effect to the cliff that towers in gloomy majesty above a group of lesser rocks projecting from its foot the westerly swell which at the time of my visit forced its way with tremendous roarings into the caverns it has worn in these black shapeless and scorified masses added to the horror of the scene the fable of the dark dogs that barked round the waist of scylla appeared to me more appropriate to this promontory than to that less fearful one on the calabrian coast the tufa of ventotiene is interstratified with lapillo or coarse fragmentary pumice it is incoherent in the higher parts of the island but to the east and particularly wherever it approaches the sealevel sufficiently indurated to be quarried and shaped for buildingstone the loose strata contain many fragments of granite and sienite and of a graystone sometimes resembling a compact felspar or clinkstone i met also with some pieces of a rock composed of mica and pyroxene alone identical with many which occur in the conglomerates of somma in the lower parts of the island these fragments are partially waterworn throughout the whole extent of ventotiene the upper strata of tufa are more or less penetrated to a short distance from the surface by a calcareous cement producing a sort of sandstone which is disposed in irregular horizontal layers connected by smaller vertical veins these are often interlaced in a reticulated manner and occasionally have the figure and structure of stalactites with a fistular cavity in the centre a few fragments of shells are observable in this sandstone but too much broken to allow of their being recognized where the volcanic sand predominates over the cement this stone is hard and solid where the calcareous matter abounds it is friable in some parts the grain is fine and the rock becomes compact and shows a semiconchoidal fracture these beds appear of very recent origin and to have resulted from the deposition of calcareous particles by water filtering through strata of loose volcanic sand of different degrees of fineness but since the rest of the island is entirely volcanic from whence are we to suppose the calcareous matter derived it is difficult to conceive it to originate any where but in the upper bed of vegetable earth through which the rain water percolates carrying off the substance of the testacea that are undergoing decomposition there and this hypothesis is corroborated by the remarkable quantity of recent landshells observable in the stratum of soil wherever it is cut through lime is known to exist in a state of combination with the other constituents of volcanic rocks and consequently of their triturated particles which compose the tufa from thence we may suppose it taken up by the superficial vegetation and converted into a carbonate which is transferred to the mollusca that feed on these plants and require it for the construction of their shells the ultimate decomposition of these restores it to the earth where it enters again into the composition of a mineral mass a similar process seems to take place on the sides of vesuvius where calcareous stalactites have been observed to form upon the roofs of caves in the lava rocks occurring within the cultivated district of the mountain the volcanic island of st helena presents an analogous formation which is probably by no means of rare occurrence amongst volcanic districts though the absence of other sources of calcareous matter is not in all so incontestable san stefano east of ventotiene and at the distance of rather more than a mile lies an islet of this name which is made use of as a depot for convicts by the neapolitan government it is nearly circular less than half a mile in diameter and surrounded by steep and craggy cliffs in structure it resembles ventotiene consisting of a single mass of graystone rising from to feet above the sea and surmounted by a few strata of loose tufa the upper part of the rock is exceedingly cellular the lower has a rude tendency to the columnar configuration the composition of the rock is similar to the graystone of the larger island the surface of san stefano is deeply indented by two shelving ravines opening on opposite sides these i conclude to be the two craters spoken of by dolomieu it is however probable that if any crater was originally formed during the protrusion of this mass the loose and fragmentary parts of its circumference must have been destroyed by the degrading action of the sea the few conglomerate strata that remain appear to have moulded themselves on the irregular surface of the bed they rest upon and are not sufficiently abundant to point out the position of the orifice of production the proximity of this is nevertheless attested by the scoriform character of the graystone rock a calcareous sandstone similar to that described above in ventotiene is found on the surface of this smaller island and suggests the same observations from the above details on the constitution of this group of islands it will perhaps appear that they afford scope as was anticipated for observations of considerable geological interest it remains therefore to point out the analogies they present to thq volcanic formations of other neighbouring countries and recall the particular facts which tend to elucidate the yet obscure history of these rocks in a general view it is impossible to overlook the decided separation of the rocks which compose these islands into two classes apparently belonging to two different ages in this locality at least viz the trachytes with their accompanying conglomerates and ndly those rocks which without stopping to discuss the question as to their also belonging or not to the family of trachytes have been mentioned to avoid present discussion by the name of graystone in the island of ponza where alone these two classes are found together they are separated by horizontal strata of tufa which probably belong to the later rock since they have been deposited after the subjacent trachytes had suffered a considerable degree of denudation the graystone is also in every instance accompanied by its peculiar conglomerates the first class of rocks bears a decided analogy to some of the trachytic formations of hungary so minutely described by m beudant and is perhaps more nearly allied to them than to the more contiguous rocks of the same family in italy france and germany thus the prismatic trachyte of ponza corresponds very closely in mineral composition to some varieties of the trachyte of the hungarian groups it is however clearly distinguished from the predominant rock species of those districts by the total absence of hornblende which is so frequent and conspicuous an ingredient in the trachytes of hungary as occasionally to bring them very near to the characters of basalt the ponza trachyte differs also from that of hungary as well as from most rocks of this family yet observed in the regularity and constancy of its prismatic configuration but this character is of trifling moment in the comparison since it mainly depends upon adventitious circumstances the same mass of rock being in many instances found to occur prismatic in one part and amorphous in another another peculiar feature of the ponza trachyte is its ribboned structure in which as well as in its constant association with a semivitreous conglomerate it offers some analogy to the perlite of hungary after an attentive perusal of the great work of m beudant and an inspection of the collection of specimens brought by him to paris no doubt remained on my mind that the zoned structure of the hungarian perlite semivitreous trachyte and the lenticular form of its lithoidal parts are owing to the substance of the rock having been drawn out in the direction of the zones while possest of an imperfect fluidity and after the globularconcretionary separation characteristic of pearlstone had wholly or in part taken place the motion was probably owing in this case to the subsidence or flowing of the matter in obedience to the impulse of its own gravity down a slightly inclined plane since the direction of the zones is universally more or less horizontal as was the case with the vitreous lava currents of lipari volcano teneriffe and iceland which are ribboned in the same manner and pass repeatedly into pearlstone in ponza and palmarola the zones are more frequently vertical than horizontal and appear to have invariably taken the direction in which the mass was impelled from below upwards through the broken and separated portions of overlying rocks that opposed its expansion in all these cases the curvatures and contortions of the stripes are obviously owing to the obstacles whether internal or from without by which the uniform progress of the liquid matter was impeded and principally to the various degrees of mobility of its different layers those of coarser grain and particularly the spherolitic concretions retarding the motion of the proximate layers which possessed a greater liquidity the same remark applies with equal force to the similar rocks of the american cordilleras these are described by m de humboldt as uniformly ribboned and often to such a degree as to put on the appearance of stratification as exhibiting a base composed of bluishgray semivitreous globules closely compacted together and inclosing parallel zones and lenticular masses of obsidian cinapecuaro oio del agua del pinal c as enveloping fragments of reddish brown trachyte halffused at one extremity of parallel elongated cellular cavities it is obvious at once how closely these characters correspond to those of the pearlstone of ponza and palmarola and they are explained with the utmost facility by the process which is proved to have given rise to them in the latter case the last variety of perlite quoted above affords a beautiful illustration of the truth of this theory it is quite evident that the elongated cells which stretch in parallel lines behind halffused fragments of felspar spherolites in the words of m de humboldt like the tail of a comet from its nucleus were created by the inferior mobility of these coarse fragments to that of the finer enveloping mass and are analogous to the hollow that forms behind any stationary or resisting body which is plunged into a running stream these cells therefore are certain indications of the direction in which the mass was moving immediately before its consolidation i may remark that the pearlstone of oyamel the mountain of knives in mexico veined with obsidian bears a still further analogy to that of palmarola in the vertical direction of its zones by which these masses are proved to have been propelled from below in the manner of dykes it may be mentioned that some varieties of the porplure molaire of m beudant as far as can be distinguished from the specimens i have had the opportunity of seeing are identical with the siliceous parts of the prismatic trachyte of ponza the similar varieties that occur in the island of ischia have been already adverted to the siliceous trachyte of the ponza group must be conceived to correspond to the porphyre trachytique avec quartz of hungary in its porphyritic character compactness quartzose nature and the chalcedony that lines its cavities its veins of nearly pure quartz groups of amethystine crystals and the brecciated aspect of its flinty parts bring it nearer to the porphyre molaire of that country m beudant indeed mentions these two species of trachyte as passing mutually into one another and therefore as in ponza mere varieties of the same rock lastly the overlying conglomerate strata of ponza and palmarola almost entirely composed of triturated pumice correspond both in situation and nature to the conglomerats ponceux of the hungarian groups little analogy exists between the rocks of the ponza isles and the trachytic mountains of central france beyond an occasional rather close similitude of mineral composition and those other points of resemblance that necessarily arise from their common volcanic character the trachyte of the latter district is disposed for the most part in vast beds dipping gradually away on all sides from a common centre of eruption and alternating horizontally with one another with varieties of basalt and graystone and with their conglomerates which latter are in no way altered at the surfaces of contact while the analogous rocks of the ponza group occur in irregular dykeshaped masses which interfere with and interrupt their conglomerates in the most arbitrary and irregular manner at the same time constantly effecting a change in their texture to a certain depth from the plane of contact these differences will be satisfactorily accounted for by the reflection that the latter formation is evidently of submarine origin while the trachytes of prance which are superposed to a primitive platform averaging feet above the sea and rise themselves to more than double that elevation must in all probability have proceeded from volcanic vents acting under the pressure of the atmosphere alone the other trachytic formations of italy are so little known that it would be almost useless to bring them forward as objects of comparison and indeed from their inland situation the examination of their structure is attended with all the difficulties noticed in the commencement of this paper it may be mentioned however that the two groups of the monti cimini and monte amiata appear to agree with those of prance in the characters of disposition and therefore differ in this respect from the ponza rocks which they resemble only imperfectly in mineral constitution the trachytes of the euganean hills and of la tolfa on the contrary show themselves like those of the islands in question in enormous vertical masses breaking through older formations which in the lastquoted instance is a transition limestone similar to that of zannone the pitchstone dykes of the former locality and the highly siliceous rocks which accompany the aluminite of the latter are additional features of resemblance to the ponza formation but independently of the analogies which may be traced in them to other districts the trachytes of the ponza group present circumstances of great interest in a geological view from their novelty and anomalous nature the principal of these it may be worth while to recapitulate they are the extremely regular and constant columnar division of an earthy trachyte its ribboned structure and the gradations which prove this character to arise from the linear extension of the mass while in a state of imperfect liquidity coupled with a concretionary process in fact in this rock it is easy to trace the operation of three distinct and consecutive processes to which it was subjected in the following order viz st the concretionary arrangement of its constituent minerals into spherolites of felspar imbedded in an impure and partly siliceous base ndly the movement of the mass by protrusion from below accompanied by the tumefaction elongation and finally the confusion and attenuation of the felspar globules by the production of porous parts and the fracture and envelopment of some external portions which consolidated more rapidly than the rest rdly the separation into columns upon reflection it will perhaps appear that these observations are of a nature to explain many of the most remarkable features of some traprocks such as the zoned and schistose structure of clinkstone and may even illustrate the similar appearances of elongation and contortion so frequent in gneiss and micaslate the peculiar disposition of this rock from which it appears to have repeatedly broken through superincumbent beds both of semivitreous conglomerate and of older trachyte with which it alternates in irregular and more or less vertical beds almost in the manner of the alternations of different varieties of trap with conglomerate rocks in the transition series the conversion of the rocks thus cut through both conglomerates and trachytes to a greater or less depth from the planes of contact into pitchstone generally porphyritic and passing both into pearlstone and obsidiana fact which may serve to throw some light on the hitherto obscure history of this remarkable rock in fact the pitchstone of ponza and palmarola is thus proved to be only a modification of trachyte effected by a more or less incomplete fusion under considerable pressure and friction and appears to be produced by this process indifferently from both a trachytic conglomerate and a solid rock of the same mineral constitution these localities however do not alone furnish observations of this kind i could instance various spots in the vicinity of naples and the isles of procida and lipari in which strata of pitchstone porphyritic and occasionally with the structure of pearlstone intervene between intruded beds or dykes of feldspathose lavarocks and their accompanying conglomerates graduating into both rocks differing in mineral constitution when submitted to the circumstances under which this modification takes place will of course produce different species of pitchstone thus in ponza and palmarola this substance varies with the varying character of the rocks into which it graduates perhaps even more than might have been expected from the great similarity of mineral composition in the unchanged rocks all are obviously varieties of resinous or semivitrified trachyte the pitchstone of hungary according to m beudant passes by repeated and easy gradations both into his perlite semivitreous trachyte and into a compact lithoidal felspar rock resembling the porphyre trachytique and porphyre molaire the pitchstone of the cantal is derived from a clinkstone slaty trachyte that of egg appears to be basaltic graduating into that rock the pitchstone of the valley of tribitsch in saxony repeatedly passes into a compact porphyritic felspar described by m beudant as mineralogically identical with varieties of the hungarian trachytes at grantola which i visited in this substance intervenes between a felspar porphyry and overlying strata of old red sandstone and blends imperceptibly with both these rocks the pilchstones of scotland are said to occur almost invariably in veins this situation is easily reconciled to the idea of the fusion of the congenerous rock beneath some overlying bed which must be split by the expansion accompanying this process and its fissures occupied by the liquid matter under such circumstances of pressure and friction as seem requisite for the production of the peculiar texture of pitchstone the siliceous trachyte of ponza la gabbia and zannone is of considerable interest since though the existence of quartz as a constituent mineral in trachyte is no longer a fact of such rare occurrence as it was once supposed yet in no instance that i am acquainted with has it been found to enter so largely into the composition of the rock even the porphyre molaire of hungary is far less siliceous than the analogous rock in ponza there are two causes to either of which a hasty decision might refer this abundance of quartz viz st infiltrations of water impregnated with siliceous matter and ndly that class of changes which volcanic rocks are often observed to undergo from exposure to the action of sulphureous vapours i am inclined to believe that the first of these processes may have partially modified the local disposition of the siliceous matter taking it up from one point and depositing it perhaps in a more perfectly crystallized and purer form on another and this particularly in the case of the brecciated varieties but the siliceous base of the white porphyritic trachyte and its numerous imbedded crystals of quartz can never be accounted for by the supposition of infiltration and the parts of a different texture or structure must be presumed to have derived their abundance of silex from the same source as this in the absence of proofs to the contrary on the other hand there are many circumstances which discountenance thenotion that these rocks have been subject to decomposition by acid vapours such are their general weight and density the uniformly siliceous nature of the whole mass whereas in altered lavas this character is confined to the immediate limits of thefumarole or fissures by which the vapour escapes the dispersion of numerous grains of quartz through the base of the rock wherever it puts on a porphyritic character the nonexistence of aluminite which must necessarily have been produced by the union of the sulphuric acid with the alumine of the rock and lastly the frequent brilliancy of the inclosed crystals of felspar and mica it is true that these minerals are occasionally altered the first into a kaolin the last into an ochrey powder but it is probable that this change is principally owing to meteoric influence and at all events since it is exactly in the compactest and most siliceous parts of the rock that these imbedded crystals are the most brilliant it is obvious that the predominance of silex cannot be referred to subsequent alteration we must therefore conclude that this character belonged to the original constitution of the rock at the period of its production the brecciated aspect of parts of this rock as well as of the prismatic trachyte is important from the analogy it exhibits to the occasional pseudobrecciated structure of the serpentines the older porphyries and granite this appearance is here evidently owing to those parts of the mass which consolidated first having been broken up by the continuance or renewal of its motion and their fragments enveloped in the part which still remained liquid similar instances of this brecciform structure are to be seen on other points of the volcanic district of italy as for example in a rock of graystone lava between lacco and casamicciole in the island of ischia and again on the s e flank of the rock of cumae a close inspection of these and other rocks of an analogous character leads to the conclusion that a concretionary separation of the constituent minerals influenced by the forces of affinity often assisted in producing this pseudoconglomerate structure and indeed it may be conceived without difficulty that should such a process take place before the motion of the mass had entirely subsided or a renewal of motion occur during the action of the elective process the concreted parts offering an impediment to the motion of the surrounding liquid would be broken up and enveloped in such a manner as to participate more or less in the double character of nodular concretions and imbedded fragments the occurrence of a vertical vein of cupriferous iron pyrites in the siliceous trachyte having many characters in common with ordinary metalliferous veins such as the association of the ore with black clay and quartz crystals is a fact which would have been more striking a few years back before it had been recognized that trachyte is frequently the matrix of the richest metals as for example of the gold of villalpando in mexico of konigsberg and telkebanya in hungary c in the present case the ore appears to have been produced by sublimation since it penetrates the sides of the fissure and the included fragments exactly in the manner of the specular iron so common in the clefts of volcanic rocks the quartz crystals are of contemporaneous formation in ponza the trachytic formation is separated from the incumbent rock which has been designated as graystone by strata of loose conglomerate chiefly composed of pumice and which may belong in part to both the under and overlying formations since their disposition in the chiaja di luna proves them to have been deposited at two different periods in palmarola the stratified tufa must be supposed to belong to the trachyte since in this island graystone is wanting the mineralogical characters by which this last rock graystone distinguishes itself from the subjacent trachyte have been already sufficiently enumerated its frequent occurrence in ischia procida and the volcanic district round naples has been also mentioned and in the scoglio della botte and the islands ventotiene and san stefano we see a series of similar rocks geographically connecting these localities with that of the montagna della guardia in ponza the huge mass of graystone of this mountain resting at a great height upon stratified tufa on that face of the hill which overlooks the basin of the harbour and on the other side following the inclination of these strata in a rapid descent below the level of the sea has precisely the figure and disposition of a lavacurrent the bed of graystone which forms the substratum of ventotiene has even more decidedly the form and aspect of a mass which has flowed down an inclined plane in a state of imperfect fluidity the capo del arco is the source of this current its superior elevation and the scorified nature of its rocks attesting the proximity of the orifice of production whatever accumulations of ejected matter may once have been formed to the west of this cape may naturally be supposed to have disappeared under the erosive attacks of the sea whose waves continue still to degrade even the solid lavarock the fragmentary ejections that fell on the surface of the graystone bed remain there in the form of conglomerate strata or tufa which as far as i could observe present no indications of having been deposited below the sealevel the effect of raintorrents would be sufficient to give them that occasionally waved disposition and alluvial aspect as well as their partial induration the mass of graystone of san stefano though not so decidedly currentshaped as that of the neighbouring island gives occasion to the same remarks that of la botte is reduced to too small a remnant to offer in its figure any indication of its mode of production on the whole it is worthy of remark that while the different graystone rocks of this group of islands have the general form and disposition of lavacurrents the subjacent trachytes are on the contrary disposed in a manner wholly different from that of any known body of lava produced by a supramarine volcano if we reflect on the rare occurrence of such circumstances as are necessary to the obtaining a view of the internal structure of a trachytic formation elevated by volcanic action from subaqueous vents we shall be able to appreciate the opportunity afforded in the ponza group at the same time it must not be forgotten that the destroying process which has laid open the constitution of these islands to our observation has without doubt robbed them of a very large portion of their original mass and in all probability of by far the greater part of the fragmentary products by which they were originally enveloped in conclusion it may be as well to offer a few remarks on the connection of the ponza group with the other congenerous formations of the italian coast the respective positions of the points on which the volcanic force has developed itself with the greatest intensity will be perceived at once from the accompanying map the relations of mineral character between the rocks produced from these different vents are in general extremely close the island of ischia marks the site of one of the main sources through which a vast quantity of feldspathose lavas have been disgorged mostly of the nature of graystone while others consisting almost solely of felspar have every right that can be derived from mineral composition to the denomination of trachyte both species are accompanied by tufas containing much pumice ischia is by means of procida in almost immediate contact with the phlegraean fields of pozzuoli and naples where upwards of thirty deformed craters thrown up by submarine eruptions upon a shallow coast are still distinguishable within a small space the lavas of this district are chiefly graystone but some as for example that of astroni and the monte olibano are unquestionably trachytic further on rises the insulated cone of somma and vesuvius which originally appears to have produced the same class of rocks while its later lavas are solely of a basalt in which leucite entirely replaces the felspar from the elements of which it is probably in part composed some obscure deposits of feldspathose rocks with their associated tufas appear at intervals within the recesses of the eastern shore of the bay as far as the punta di campanella southward of this cape no traces of volcanic formations exist i believe nearer than the lipari isles towards the north the hilly group of la rocca monfina rising above sessa and teano attests another powerful source of volcanic action like that of somma this vent appears first to have given rise to numerous currents of feldspathose rocks which were succeeded by leucitic lavas the detached points on which eruptions appear to have taken place though in no great number within the wide longitudinal valley of the garigliano viz at the rocca devandro and in the vicinity of pofi veroli frosinone and tichiena connect the volcanic district of the terra di lavoro with that of the campagna di roma the lavas produced by these mouths are almost solely augitic those of the great volcanic group of the monte albano are on the contrary leucitic the leucite being frequently associated with and occasionally replaced by melilite north of rome another series of volcanic vents commences in which a still closer association of the feldspathose and leucitic lavas is observable these fall without the limits of the map the intervals that separate the volcanic groups of the terra di lavoro are occupied by plains of stratified tufa which appear to have been originally redeemed from the sea when at a higher comparative level than at present by the accumulation of the fragmentary matters thrown up by the neighbouring vents and distributed pretty evenly upon its shores and bottom these conglomerates composed of comminuted pumice seem to have been drifted to a considerable distance up the valleys of the apennine chain that open into the plain of campania at the time when this massive limestone ridge formed the coast of the mediterranean this circumstance confirms the opinion that the earliest productions of the volcanos of this district were of feldspathose nature these stratified tufas must be supposed to extend beneath the space actually occupied by the sea as far at least as the groups of ischia ventotiene and ponza to which they were probably in part indebted for their origin deposits of an analogous nature appear on various points of the valley of the garigliano and on the southern foot of the mountains of the volsci bordering on the pomptine marshes others again constitute the undulating plain of the campagna di roma covering strata of tertiary marl and sandstone in all these localities they of course share in the mineral constitution of the lavas produced contemporaneously with them from the neighbouring volcanos the extensive tract of the pomptine marshes themselves has in all probability a general substratum of this nature since it crops out superficially on all the higher ground of this swampy expanse and has been also observed in the lower parts wherever excavations have been carried to any depth here it is covered by local formations of marl and peat but chiefly by vast alluvial deposits of sand thrown up by the action of the sea which have already connected the once insular rock of circe with the main land and still continue to elevate and gradually leave dry the shelving shore of the coast between terracina and ostia this sand whether taken from the actual shore or from the interior of the pomptine marshes where it extends almost as far as cisterna is found to be composed of grains of reddish flint of milk quartz and of amethystine quartz with a few fragments of felspar crystals and grains of magnetic iron this composition shows it to proceed from the harder detritus of the ponza isles or at least of the submarine rocks of the same nature with which they are doubtless connected thus while the violent sweep of the southwesterly swell is engaged continually in degrading and eating away the already skeleton forms of these exposed rocks their waterworn fragments are drifted onwards by the same force and thrown up on the shore of the neighbouring continent which gains in extent of surface even more rapidly than the islands lose it is thus that the great law of organic nature exhibits itself with equal force in the mineral kingdom the destruction of one formation giving rise to the production of another it might appear like an omission were i to terminate this paper without a word upon the ages of the formations which have been described in it i am of opinion that most of our notions on the absolute age of the pyrogenous rocks must be necessarily of a vague uncertain and hypothetical character whatever doubts may exist as to the exact manner in which many of these rocks have been produced on the surface of the globe still enough is known and generally recognized concerning the phaenomena in which they originate to show that with them the collocation of similar beds is no proof of their contemporaneous production in the sedimental and arenaceous rocks we infer the age of a whole stratum or series of strata from the observed geological relations of one of their parts notwithstanding the solutions of continuity or the concealment of intervening portions that may separate this from the remaining mass but amongst volcanic rocks we know that by the side of a mass of early date one of recent formation may be produced tomorrow exactly similar to the former in mineral composition and in reality the natural tendency of the volcanic phaenomena is by no means to produce vast and extensive formations at a single epoch but on the contrary to form partial masses one by one at very distant intervals of time which yet often agree most closely in their mineralogical characters in the case under consideration if we assume that the graystone of ponza ventotiene and san stefano belongs to the same period which their nearly equal state of preservation seems to authorize and perhaps the analogous formations of procida ischia and the phlegraean fields may be referred to the same age the superposition of this rock in ponza to the trachyte which shows signs of previous degradation will warrant the inference that the latter rock is of very early date its connection with the transition limestone in zannone conveys no information as to its age and the conclusion that might appear to follow from the absence of any intervening secondary or tertiary strata is destroyed by the fact that they are equally wanting above the trachyte the question therefore as to the absolute age of this trachyte is involved in complete obscurity xv observations on the structure of the border country of salop and north wales and of some detached groups of transition rocks in the midland counties by the rev james yates ma pgs read march th and th of the rocks which occupy the confines of shropshire and north wales lying between the slate mountains on the west and the extensive formations of limestone red sandstone marl and gravel on the east it may be observed generally that they are very various in their character and differ exceedingly in their thickness their induration and their colour they are sometimes earthy and amorphous and at other times crystalline in their structure they have sometimes the appearance of mechanical sometimes of chemical deposits and sometimes these appearances are united in the same rock in their composition they pass from argillaceous to siliceous and from siliceous to calcareous but the prevailing earth appears to be clay the next in quantity ie silica and carbonate of lime appears to be by much the least abundant of the three it may also be remarked that these strata are of moderate thickness never perhaps exceeding feet in depth and varying from that to the state of mere partings between one bed and another the harder strata are commonly separated by thinner beds of soft clay and often divide in consequence of a kind of rude crystallization into angular or rhbmboidal pieces all these circumstances produce in them a manifest tendency to disintegration they are generally conformable in their position and most commonly dip towards the east but occasionally they exhibit remarkable contortions they rise with a gentle inclination and usually terminate towards the west in abrupt escarpments while the eastern slopes of the hills which they constitute correspond evenly with the surfaces of the strata underneath they are intersected also by tortuous valleys which sometimes expand from the condition of narrow wooded glens into level plains of great fertility of the mountainous portions of this tract none perhaps are higher than feet above the level of the sea various kinds of traprocks rise through them in great masses and are distinguished by their abrupt and rounded summits passing from these general observations we may endeavour to illustrate the nature of the strata under review by the detail of their appearances in particular places this may be best done by pursuing the section of the different rocks across their basset edges to begin from the north and proceed gradually southwards the line of section which first claims attention is in the vicinity of vale crucis the lofty oernant mountain rises above the northern boundary of the valley of the dee and contains a large slate quarry belonging to sir w w wynne here the strata are curved with extraordinary regularity into the form of concentric circles the cleavages of the rock having also the appearance of radii in consequence of being perpendicular to the direction of the strata these circumstances are deserving of notice not only as exhibiting a fine specimen of curvature but as showing the primitive character of the rock at the distance of about miles to the n e is presented the perpendicular face of the rocks of edlwyseg these are part of the edge of the great basin of limestone containing the coal formation of north wales their direction is generally from east to west but in a waving course and through a tract of many miles in length a steep talus of debris covers about two thirds of their height and above this their face rises almost perpendicularly presenting a remarkable specimen of regular stratification and a striking contrast to the forms of the slate mountains in their vicinity the divisions of the strata of limestone are rendered conspicuous at a distance by beds of black bituminous shale which lie between them this shale is for the most part perfectly soft and friable it is however frequently indurated by the addition of calcareous matter and thus passes into foetid limestone it is also sometimes mixed with a large proportion of sand and then resembles very much the mud deposited in the estuaries of the dee and mersey these cliffs contain various shells and corals usually considered as belonging to the mountain limestone of england in the case of shells occurring in the limestone beds the matter of the shells is generally removed only casts remaining or newer depositions of calcareous spar in place of the original substance but in the beds of shale the testaceous matter seems to be preserved with very little alteration in its texture or composition in a formation of so great antiquity in the geological history of the globe this circumstance appears not a little curious and interesting the softness of the shale in which they are imbedded also contributes to render these specimens of fossil shells remarkably perfect the muscular impressions and interior structure of the larger terebratulae being exhibited with great distinctness the valley situated between the craigs of eglwyseg and the oernant mountain contains hills of moderate elevation their superior fertility and beauty the lively red colour of the ploughed fields and the rounded masses of red conglomerate scattered among the debris of the limestone prepare the geological traveller to expect a rock such as that of which they consist and which is hard highly ferruginous stratified tending to slaty and composed of grains and small pebbles of the older rocks united by an argillaceous cement this rock is therefore a variety of the grauwacke of the continental geologists its extent is very limited nearer llangollen and about the steep hill of dinas bran we find only the common appearances of the beds of shale slate and slaty sandstone about to be described as occupying by far the greater part of the region under our review the next section which i shall attempt to describe is represented by a line drawn from oswestry westward to llansilin such a line crosses within the space of miles the basset edges of all the strata from the new red sandstone to the slate after quitting the level ground about oswestry which consists of gravel clay and sand and covers beds of coal we come to the strata which dip under the coal and belong to the millstone grit formation these strata form several successive ridges which rise higher and higher as we advance towards the west the eastern slope of each ridge appears to correspond with considerable exactness to the plane of the strata beneath it although these strata are overspread with gravel clay and sand the western slope is steeper cutting across the outcrop of the strata on the summit of one of these ridges at the distance of miles from oswestry is the racecourse commanding an extensive view of the rounded slate mountains of wales on the west and of the plain of shropshire to the east besides the wrekin and the other hills which encompass this plain to the south and east another series of hills meets the eye which is more interesting to the geological observer though of inferior elevation for as he stands upon the verge of strata dipping east he sees the hills alluded to dipping in different directions according to the order of their arrangement so as to form the basin which contains the coal field situated on the confines of shropshire and north wales these hills are st those of nesscliff whose escarpment is towards the southeast then greensill near it the cleve which rises with an even slope terminated by a most distinct escarpment towards the east and lastly the two ridges of hawkstone one to the north of the other thus the strata of these hills together with those on which the spectator is situated are seen to converge so as to form a basin for the deposits of coal and they consequently suggest to him the supposition that as the rocks beneath his feet belong to the millstone grit formation those in the series of hills so connected with them may probably belong to the same class of strata the ridge on the summit of whicli the racecourse is situated has a very precipitous escarpment along its base flows a small river called the cynheth and the grounds of llanvorda the residence of mr henry wynne occupy that part of it which lies to the south of the racecourse this escarpment displays in regular succession the strata of the millstone grit formation the uppermost are found to consist of hornstone which varies in its colour and texture sometimes becoming very fine and passing into perfect flint it divides by its cleavages into rhomboidal pieces and has evidently supplied many of the pebbles both angular and rounded which abound in the gravel between this ridge and oswestry below these strata is a bed several feet thick of white sandstone it consists of grains almost entirely siliceous which are for the most part cemented into a firm rock by a siliceous deposition but in many situations the texture of this sandstone is more loose and friable in some places it is spotted throughout its substance with black and brown oxide of iron in others it contains the hollow impressions of entrochi we then come to a remarkable bed of indurated clay generally of an ochre yellow colour though sometimes passing into bluish or brownish black it is light and adheres to the tongue below this are successive beds of sandstone the thickness of which far exceeds that of the upper beds and sometimes amounts to several yards some of them contain contemporaneous veins of silica which are very conspicuous by their projection on surfaces exposed to the weather sometimes the sides of these veins are exposed instead of their cross fracture in these cases they are striated like slickensides but certainly not from the effect of friction the upper beds are still white and somewhat approaching to chert those underneath become ferruginous and contain a few impressions of entrochi and of curved cylindrical forms apparently of vegetable origin the lowest bed which is also the thickest and far exceeds the others in the height of its precipices and the size of its detached fragments is of a dark red colour its grains of sand slightly cohering and glittering in the sun this rock descends to the river which flows at the base of the escarpment and also dips under it from the opposite slope of the valley its broken and precipitous faces are sometimes reduced by the action of the weather into the form of irregularly rounded masses and at other times are streaked by the projecting lines of the harder siliceous veins pursuing the course of the river from llanvorda towards its head we find beds of limestone rising from beneath the sandstone the direct road from oswestry to llansilin leaves the spot now described at the distance of about a mile to the north it crosses similar beds which are extended over a greater space because accompanied by no escarpment so high and precipitious as that of llanvorda we first come to these beds after passing offas dyke about two miles from oswestry they are foundthrough the space of about two miles further along the sides of the road and in quarries and weatherworn cliffs they appear to dip uniformly under one another with an inclination of about to the horizon the white cherty beds are succeeded by a dark red sandstone analogous to that which forms the base of the escarpment at llanvorda pebbles of quartz are disseminated through it the summit of a considerable hill on the left hand of the road called mynydd moel consists of this sandstone its exposed cliffs are worn into irregularly rounded masses and resemble the usual appearances of the red sandstone of lancashire cheshire and shropshire on advancing westwards we next come to a bed which lies under the red sandstone and consists of grains and small pebbles of quartz with a few pebbles of slate and joints of encrinites rather loosely aggregated by a calcareous cement limestone of the same gray colour with the cement of this conglomerate immediately succeeds it abounds in corals encrinites and shells large quarries are worked in it on each side of the road it contains numerous veins often an inch or more in thickness of the red sulphate of barytes towards the east it slopes gradually with a dip conformable to that of the calcareous breccia and the sandstones lying over it whereas on the western side looking towards the mountainous country of wales it terminates in perpendicular precipices it contains beds of soft crumbling shale and is evidently to be regarded as a continuation of the interrupted chain of the limestone of eglwyseg among the corallines of these strata is a madrepore bunches of which are seen on the upper surfaces of the beds of limestone along this ridge evidently in the same position in which they originally grew the limestone which now penetrates and envelops them has been deposited without removing them from their places or even materially altering their form i have observed the same curious phenomenon in the ridge of mountain limestone which rises over the strata of brecon forest in south wales and i am informed by an accurate observer mr underwood that he has seen it in the same formation at plasnewydd in anglesea and on the opposite side of the menai on advancing westward so as to surmount the ridge of limestone the eye is impressed by the immediate change in the character of the scenery from that of long ridges of moderate elevation to the appearance of huge mountains divided by valleys of corresponding dimensions between these two kinds of scenery the wall of limestone forms a line of demarcation the strata which dip under the limestone and constitute mountains feet in height consist of numerous beds of a slaty micaceous sandstone dividing by natural separations into rhomboids of a micaceous clayslate and of a soft shale these beds are very numerous and various in their thickness but in general the rhomboidal kind is conspicuous among the others in consequence of the even vertical surfaces presented by its broken strata it seems to be the same rock with the rhomboidal killas of devonshire and cornwall which dr berger has denominated common grauwacke besides the stratified rocks now described as lying under the limestone a mass of porphyritic greenstone presents itself at glascoed near llansilin in five or six considerable hills which are distinguished by their abrupt rounded forms rising like irregular knobs among the stratified rocks and covered with gorse and coarse grass the strata of limestone appear more inclined where they lie upon the greenstone but do not show marks of disturbance shall now attempt some account of the rocks which occur in the direction of the road from welchpool to ludlow containing the country intermediate between the limestone ridge already described and that of wenlock edge the whole of this tract is principally occupied by strata of the slaty micaceous sandstone dividing into rhomboidal pieces and alternating with shale which has been mentioned as lying beneath the limestone at llansilin but sometimes a crystalline siliceous deposition occurs and at intervals unstratified masses of trap present themselves these together with the remains of organic bodies will claim our chief attention an example of the siliceous deposition is seen to advantage in the park near powis castle in the immediate vicinity of welchpool it occurs in strata dipping towards the northwest at an angle varying from to and forms a long ridge with an abrupt escarpment the strata are not separated by planes but have a waved and swelling superficies when broken they divide into pieces having sharp edges and angles and triangular or trapezoidal surfaces in many places the rock becomes very red in others it is little or not at all coloured with iron masses and thin beds of clay are found among the strata from the clayey and ferruginous portions the soil of the park is probably derived it is fertile and abounds with fine trees these circumstances all show the identity of this rock with that so often noticed at bromsgrove lickey near birmingham in this however the imbedded grains of sand are larger than in the lickey quartzrock at both these places the siliceous rock contains impressions of the various shells corals c which are found in the limestone in some cases the cavities so impressed have been filled again by a subsequent deposition of calcareous spar which also forms veins in the rock and entirely penetrates its substance half a mile from welchpool on the west of that town are large quarries of greenstone worked in the side of an eminence called standard hill the principal cleavages of the rock are nearly vertical in parallel planes or yards asunder by other cleavages subordinate to these and perpendicular to their planes it
