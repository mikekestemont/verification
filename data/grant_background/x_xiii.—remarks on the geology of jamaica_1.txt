xiiiremarks on the geology of jamaica by h t de la beche esq frs fls fel geol soc hon mem phys and nat soc of geneva etc read dec nd and jan th the detailed observations which alone can establish on a secure basis the solution of those great geological problems on which the hope of ultimately arriving at any satisfactory theory must of necessity depend are notwithstanding the rapid progress which geology has recently made as yet confined to districts comparatively limited the investigation of the order in which the mineral masses constituting the earths surface rest upon each other and the inquiry how far that order is invariablewhether the remains of successive races of organized beings which characterize the different members of the geological series exhibit in distant countries general features of analogy or of distinctionand how far the action of the various geological causes which appear to have operated in those localities with which we are best acquainted can be recognised in othersare questions which have hitherto been principally confined to a few european countries even the very valuable materials which the comprehensive mind of humboldt has accumulated must be considered rather as indicating the extent of the field before us than as having fully occupied any part of it in the present state of our knowledge detailed monographs of particular districts although from their very nature in themselves dry and tedious and little calculated to attract the general reader must necessarily precede those extensive views which are more delightful in proportion to the higher intellectual powers which they require for their developement in the hope of contributing in the more humble manner towards the advancement of a science to which i have been long attached offer the following observations feeling at the same time that they require a few preliminary words of explanation and apology the minuteness of many of the details into which i have found it expedient to enter may appear perhaps to many unnecessarily tedious but it must be remembered that in describing a remote and if i may so speak a new geological country in which the identification and general relations of its constituent rocks are either imperfectly or not at all illustrated by previous knowledge there is scarcely an alternative between this and a description too vague to be useful for example if the geologist were describing the course of the chalk or oolitic series in any portion of the european basin he would be guided at once by his previous knowledge of these formations as to what circumstances were really material in their physical history and what were merely subordinate and unimportant and assuming the same general information on the part of his readers he might dismiss the subject with all the spirit of a rapid sketch but in treating of a formation hitherto unexamined the white limestone of jamaica for instance the case is entirely altered all local circumstances then become of temporary importance because it is only from the more extended comparison of these that their true relative value can be ascertained with regard to faults of omission a tropical climate may perhaps be urged in extenuation for not to speak of that incapacity for exertion whether of body or mind which it is so calculated to produce the physical obstacles which it opposes to the researches of the geologist are neither few nor trifling the tropical forests present not the least of these for splendid and luxuriant as they are they are from their very luxuriance almost impenetrable without the aid of persons to cut a path in them the parasitical plants festooning from tree to tree and interlacing one with the other as yet no geological description has appeared of jamaica nor indeed of either of the large islands of cuba or hayti so that we have few or no facts previously ascertained to guide us while investigating the rock formations in jamaica neither can we trace the various changes that the rocks have undergone within moderate distances by comparing the structure of one island with the other the geological accounts therefore which humboldt has given us of mexico and south america become highly valuable as they afford us information respecting countries not very remote from jamaica the only private collection i believe of jamaica rocks or fossils existing in england previously to my return from the investigation which is the subject of this memoir was in the possession of richard bright esq of ham green near bristol this collection was made in jamaica by his son mr robert bright a few years ago and the inspection of it before my embarkation was of great use to me in directing my attention to those points in the island whence they had been procured the examination of rock formations in countries far distant from each other cannot fail of exciting the highest interest in the geologist for he then has an opportunity of observing whether or not the same causes have been in action in various parts of the earths surface and whether the superposition remarked in on portion of the globe is the same with that seen in another he moreover w see whether or not rocks exist which are not included in our european lists for as we sometimes find several formations wanting between two rocks in england and elsewhere so my we find rock formations in america which are wanting in europe there being no more reason why in a series of rocks represented by a y o h should not be missing in europe than that should be found in england and be wanting in germany the following observations will be confined to that part of jamaica which is situated to the eastward of a line drawn from alligator pond bay to st anns bay thus taking in nearly the eastern half of the island where the most elevated mountains are found the whole of this portion of jamaica is hilly and mountainous with the exception of the extensive plains of liguanea st catherines st dorothy vere and the lower part of clarendon the highest range in the island is that of the blue mountains situated in the eastern part of jamaica in the parishes of port royal st david st thomasintheeast portland and st george their principal direction is nearly east and west but they do not as is often represented extend through the whole length of the island for with the other mountains to the westward of the agua alta or wag water they have no connexion the cold or main ridge varies from about to feet in height and the summit is in some places so narrow as not to be more than three or four yards across from the northern side of part of this ridge a curved ridge detaches itself of gteater elevation than the other and from this curved ridge rise three principal masses which have obtained the name of peaks that to the east being the most conical robertson in his map of jamaica estimates their different heights at and feet above the level of the sea that which he calls the northern peak being the most elevated these heights i am inclined to think too great for my barometrical measurements though incomplete would seem to give about feet for the highest peak catherines peak which i found by barometrical measurement to be feet in height forms the highest point of the mountains crossing the island from nw to se through the parishes of port royal st andrew and st george and constituting the next highest range to the blue mountains the port royal mountains are of considerable elevation even near the sea flamstead house upon the summit of one of them being feet above its level to the westward of this range the mountains are of less elevation robertson gives the height of lunans mountain to the north of spanish town as feet from stony hill barracks which i make by barometrical measurement to be feet in height a number of mountains of nearly equal elevation extend into st marys green castle upon the summit of one of them being feet above the sea the trap mountains of st johns attain considerable elevation and are remarkable for sharp ridges intersecting each other in various directions the valleys between them becoming suddenly deep close to their commencement robertson gives feet as the height of the bull head an elevated portion of the mountain in the north of clarendon which may in some measure be considered as a western prolongation of those in st johns the range of the mocho mountains also in clarendon is separated from the above by the basin drained by the mountain portion of the rio minho and its tributary streams the mocho mountains are nearly of the same height as that elevated district which being divided at the top into many small hills and valleys has obtained the name of the manchester mountains the mocho are separated from the latter mountains by a picturesque valley several miles in length called mile gully which gradually falls into the great plain of vere and lower clarendon the greater part of the parish of st ann is elevated land divided into hills and valleys in the manner of manchester but on a larger scale this land attains considerable elevation at monte diablo where it towers above the basin of st thomasinthevale a continuation of the monte diablo range extends to the ne and separates the two parishes the above is the general character of the principal elevated portions of that part of jamaica which it is my present intention to describe the principal plain is that of liguanea with its prolongation through the parishes of st catherine and st dorothy the mountains terminate suddenly upon the liguanea plain which is inclined falling gradually from a height of more than feet near the hope tavern to the sea near kingston the plain of st catherine bounded on the south by the healthshire hills with its continuation into st dorothy does not appear to be so much inclined the great plain of vere and lower clarendon is separated from the above by a low range of hills connected with the higher mountains of clarendon this district is bounded on the north by the mocho mountains and on the west by those of manchester a remarkable hill called the round hill in vere terminates this plain near the mouth of the milk river and another named kemps hill rises in the middle of vere portland ridge bounds these lowlands on the se this plain would not appear to be much inclined as the works at halse hall estate situated some distance inland are only about feet above the level of the sea luidas vale a remarkable basin in the upper part of the parish of st john would form the bottom of a lake were not the waters which run into and fall upon it carried off by numerous sinkholes or gulfs but of this more hereafter the elevated basin of whitney estate situated in the mocho range is a repetition of luidas vale on a small scale the waters losing themselves in sinkholes and the river which sinks near the works of the estate being generally considered as reappearing on the other side of the mountain as the head of the milk river the basin of st thomasinthevale now studded with sugar estates would also form the bottom of a lake if the rocky pass through which the rio cobre flows were stopped up this defile is a break in the range of the red hills and cannot fail to remind the geologist of many similar breaks in mountain chains in other parts of the world which if closed would convert the districts the waters of which they are the means of carrying off into lakes a plain of some extent covered with sugar estates occurs between bath st thomasintheeast and the mouth of the plantain garden river few countries excel jamaica in picturesque beauty the great variety of its surface added to the luxuriance of tropical vegetation cannot fail to charm those who have visited it for the first time many of the valleys which take their rise in the blue mountain range more particularly those on the northern side present a fine union of rock wood and water the rivers running in these valleys are in general short and rapid and when swollen by heavy tropical rains dangerous to pass the views from the summits of many of the mountains are most splendid particularly at sunset and that from the top of catherines peak extending to the north and south sides of the island is well known and easily attainable the blue mountain peaks as might be expected present noble and commanding views over the eastern part of the island to obtain these however the traveller is in general compelled to ascend some tree as the peaks are covered with vegetation which in a great measure conceals the country from him having thus presented the reader with a slight sketch of the scenery of jamaica i shall proceed to enumerate the different rocks commencing with those of the oldest formation submedial or transition rocks rocks which may be referred to this class compose the principal portion of the blue mountain range and are continued in a northeast direction through the parish of st george into that of st mary they are the oldest rocks which occur in the part of jamaica examined by me and from the information which i have obtained there does not appear to be any rock of equal age in the other or western portion theboundary lines of these rocks may be described commencing with st marys as forming the whole of the coast of the latter parish eastward from the mouth of the agua alta or wag water to within a mile or two of ora cabessa bay with the exception of jacks bay don christophers point blowing point forsters cove green cove pagee point fort haldane and the small island opposite port maria in all which places the submedial rocks are covered by a part of the white limestone formation to be mentioned hereafter the latter formation rests upon and bounds the above rocks in the vicinity of eden estate near ora cabessa from thence after crossing a hill the line passes at the foot of the high white limestone hills that rise above the submedial country in the neighbourhood of the union and ramble estates and afterwards passes at the base of a continuation of the above high land to the vicinity of unity and nonsuch estates from the latter point the line is continued a little to the south of konigsburg and crosses the agua alta to the north of its confluence with the ugly river in this part of its course the submedial country is covered by red sandstone and conglomerate quitting the parish of st mary the southern boundary line of these rocks crosses the mountains which separate the agua alta from the buff bay river to the northern face of catherines peak then enters port royal parish following the course of the yallahs river for some distance and afterwards skirts the base of the blue mountain range through st davids to bath in st thomasintheeast from the latter place round the coast to port antonio the submedial country is separated from the sea by the white limestone formation except near the latter place where porphyry intervenes between them from port antonio to annotto bay the northern boundary line of these rocks passes at some little distance from the coast through the parishes of portland and st george gradually approaching the sea as it reaches annotto bay upon the swift great spanish and buff bay rivers these rocks will be observed separated from the white limestone formation by red sandstone the following rocks constitute this submedial country grauwackethis rock is well exposed in st marys and varies in its structure from a finegrained compact sandstone to a coarse conglomerate both occurring in beds of various thickness and occasionally interstratified with grauwacke slate of various degrees of fineness the colour of this rock varies from gray to brown the conglomerate contains portions of quartz syenite c from the size of a nut to three or four inches in diameter the road from porsters cove to port maria affords several fine sections of slaty and compact grauwacke the inland road from port maria to islington estate does the same more particularly near quebec estate between which place and port maria there is a good exhibition of the compact variety in thick beds the strata of this district though they sometimes undulate and therefore have the appearance of inclining in contrary directions dip generally to the sw at angles varying from to there are however some thick conglomerate beds which though of rather an ambiguous character more resemble the grauwacke conglomerate of jamaica than any other rock which i observed in the island these dip to the n at porsters cove between the latter place and islington thin beds and nodules of compact grayish blue limestone occur among the grauwacke rocks near albion estate not far from port maria compact sandstone beds which appear to belong to the grauwacke series will be observed and between that place and eden estate i found a compact sandstone with vegetable impressions these were however but ill defined and had the appearance of reeds not of ferns large blocks of porphyry with a dull green and rather earthy base containing white crystals of felspar and small grains of quartz are found at stony cove this rock would seem to be associated with the grauwacke the grauwacke beds on the coast at carlton wood house a short distance eastward from forsters cove dip at a considerable angle to the ne but at agualta vale pen under the hill upon which the house stands is afforded a section of slaty and compact grauwacke beds dipping at about an angle of to the sw so that the strata would appear to be arched between these two places the latter of which is situated about five miles in a sse direction from the former proceeding from agualta vale pen up the agua alta grauwacke occasionally composed of very thick beds of coarse conglomerate will be observed for some distance up the picturesque valley in which the river flows the valley of the buff bay river affords a somewhat different section of the grauwacke ascending the river and after passing some red sandstone among which porphyritic rocks are seen we meet with thick beds of a brownish red compact sandstone mixed with slaty marl and very much resembling the old red sandstone of south wales this sandstone gradually loses its colour passes into gray sandstone and becomes mixed with coarse slate reminding the observer of the passages of old red sandstone into grauwacke in england c the grauwacke continues for some distance up the river and then seems gradually to pass into a blueish marly slate which slightly effervesces mixed with grayish sandstone grauwacke and beds of dark gray compact limestone traversed by numerous veins of calcareous spar which latter become more abundant after passing belcarres the dip of the grauwacke beds on the buff bay river is to the ne and nne being the same with the carlton wood house beds this afterwards becomes the nearly general dip of the submedial rocks composing the blue mountain range the great spanish and swift rivers present little or no section of grauwacke the rock which succeeds the red sandstones in those places being principally composed of slaty marl with sandstone and nodules and beds of compact gray limestone such as occur beneath the grauwacke on the buff bay river the rio grande the next great river to the eastward that cuts the blue mountain range affords sections of grauwacke closely resembling those of st marys the road from port antonio to golden vale is interesting in this respect as thin beds of grauwacke sandstones intermixed with argillaceous slates are there observable dipping from ese to se the higher part of the cunha cunha road between port antonio and bath st thomasintheeast and over the continuation of the blue mountains presents a mixture of brown and gray slaty and compact grauwacke beds interstratified near the summit of the mountain with a conglomerate in which the rounded pebbles are often of large size and which evidently belongs to the same series in fact the mechanical origin of grauwacke is well exhibited in jamaica its beds varying from a finegrained sandstone to a conglomerate thepebbles in which are often of considerable size i have observed but little of this rock on the southern side of the cold ridge unless indeed the gray compact siliceous sandstone mixed with slate and thin beds of gray compact limestone occurring on the northern side of catherines peak be considered a variety of it ascending the mountain from the buff bay river which is commonly known by the name of st georges gap a rock is seen partly composed of a kind of marly argillaceous slate apparently grauwacke some of its beds resembling those found on the agua alta these dip to the ne and therefore would appear to underlie the limestones of the buff bay river they however seem mixed near the summit of the mountain with redsandstone and red conglomerate beds resembling those found on the buff bay river to the south of charles town maroon town and noticed above as passing into grauwacke these red beds are the more remarkable as they also very much resemble those found on the summit and southern face of the same mountain which would appear to constitute parts of a newer formation than the grauwacke the beds of redsandstone and conglomerate associated with the grauwacke on the northern side of st georges gap dip at a considerable angle to the ne while the beds on the summit and southern face of the mountain dip at a great angle to the sw the dips become so suddenly altered that it is somewhat difficult to suppose them arched submedial or transition limestone the buff bay river affords a fine section of grayish blue compact limestone traversed by more or less numerous veins of calcareous spar and altogether resembling in mineralogical structure the common submedial or transition limestones of europe i did not discover organic remains in it such as belong to similar rocks in other parts of the worldin fact i was not fortunate enough to meet with any but occurring as it does among the rocks mentioned above and being so completely associated with them there can be little doubt that they belong to the same epoch of formation and if the sandstones conglomerates and argillaceous slates mentioned above were formed at the same time with the grauwacke rocks of europe the limestones under consideration must be submedial or transition limestones the upper beds of these limestones are much mixed with sandstones the latter however gradually disappear and the former become alone associated with a marly slate containing calcareous matter these strata are frequently much contorted and twisted of which the river sections afford many fine examples no great dependence can therefore be placed on dips it may nevertheless be as well to state that at belcarres the strata dip to the nw having previously dipped to the nne the marly slate becomes very abundant as we approach the ascent of the mountain to st georges gap some short distance up avhich these strata are continued it should be remarked that a kind of coal is stated to have been found among the belcarres strata i had no opportunity of examining a specimen from this place but should conceive that it must be of the anthracite kind a similar substance i was informed had been found at guatamala upon the cave river which flows into the swift river but in what rock it would be difficult to say for there are beds of redsandstone at that place as well as the limestone and marly beds which cross over from the buff bay river the latter rocks are exposed to view on the swift and great spanish rivers and the iron pyrites found among them on the banks of the former have been mistaken for gold submedial limestones occur occasionally on the southern side of the blue mountain range from the head of the yallahs river to the neighbourhood of bath in st thomasintheeast sometimes associated with sandstones and slates having a grauwacke appearance at others with greenstones syenites and other trap rocks in a singular manner thin beds of compact gray blue limestone are seen connected with slaty shale in the vicinity of clifton near catherines peak these dip at an angle oftotheene the green river which falls into the yallahs river near green valley works brings down in its course from the cold ridge a considerable quantity of compact grayish blue limestone which shows that this rock occurs in this part of the blue mountains blueishgray limestone may also be observed near green valley abbey green st davids situate on the southern side of the cold ridge is one of the highest coffee settlements in jamaica the house upon it i make by barometrical measurement to be feet above the level of the sea at this place submedial limestone of a gray colour and traversed by veins of calcareous spar will be found associated in a rather singular manner with syenite greenstone grauwacke and argillaceous slate the superposition of one above the other being very indistinct so that little can be learned from this spot which would if a better section were afforded be highly interesting in a geological point of view as the limestone is here seen close to the trap rocks and does not appear from what is exposed by section to have suffered much if any alteration not far from portland gap a depression in the cold ridge which i estimate from barometrical observations to be feet above the sea and on the road to that place from abbey green i found a large block of grayish white limestone approaching the crystalline or saccharine character and somewhat resembling the primitive limestones it was however most probably derived from some bed associated with the submedial rocks of the district which is concealed beneath the thick foliage of the tropical forest that rises above the spot where the block is found sections of submedial limestone are afforded near bath in st thomasintheeast the best is that seen between the village and the hot spring up the valley of the sulphur river a dark lilaccoloured compact limestone will be there observed connected with trap rocks and argillaceous slate the bath mineral spring the heat of which i found to be fahrenheit the thermometer being plunged into the spring itself rises from a mixture of argillaceous slate and thin beds of compact gray limestone trap rocks being however not far distant the first part of the ascent of the cunha cunha road from the plantain garden river presents a continuation of the beds exposed in the valley of the sulphur river a lilaccoloured limestone traversed by veins of calcareous spar being associated with argillaceous slate and trap higher up the mountain on the same road a light gray limestone of very compact texture is seen forming part of the submedial country argillaceous slatei did not observe that this rock constituted by itself any considerable portion of the submedial or transition country of jamaica the variety commonly called grauwacke slate occurs however in considerable abundance in the parish of st mary in some places not much mixed with the thick and compact grauwacke beds argillaceous slate may occupy considerable space in the blue mountains for there were many sections of this range which i had no opportunity of examining this slate is found not only in those places where this rock has been mentioned as occurring associated with others but also beneath the white limestone formation on the ridge which separates the morant from the plantain garden river between spring and whitehall estates it is also seen mixed with trap rocks in the bed of the plantain garden river from the latter place to bath the mass of marly slate which occurs with the limestones from belcarres on the buff bay river to the st georges gap mountain can scarcely in strictness be called argillaceous slate and therefore cannot fairly be classed under this head it however forms so considerable a portion of country and is such a conspicuous feature in the geology of this part of jamaica that it scarcely deserves to be considered as subordinate to the limestones micaceous slate and hornstonethe latter interstratified in thin beds with argillaceous slate of a micaceous lustre is found on the ascent of the blue mountains between green valley and sheldon the hornstone is striped and sometimes splits into a slate resembling flinty slate these strata dip to the ne at angles varying from to apparently beneath the mass of rocks which are crowned by the blue mountain peaks a lightcoloured sandstone is met with between charlottenburg and islington in the parish of st mary which differs from the grauwacke of the country and indeed from any grauwacke i have ever seen yet as it occurs among this submedial district and does not appear connected with any secondary rock its place would seem to be among the class of rocks under consideration and i may also observe that there are some other strata in the same parish particularly slaty brown marls with thin seams of white occasionally associated with them which it would be difficult to separate from the grauwacke of jamaica though they differ from the grauwacke of europe these strata are observable in one or two places between charlottenburg and islington as also on the mountain between albion estate near port maria and eden near ora cabessa in the whole of this submedial or transition country i was not fortunate enough to meet with any fossil organic remains except the vegetable impressions of the sandstone in the mountain between port maria and ora cabessa i may therefore be asked why i have named the limestone associated with these rocks transition or submedial limestonei can only reply that it mineraloically resembles the transition limestones that i have seen in various parts of europe and great britain and that it occurs with a sandstone and conglomerate very much resembling grauwacke with argillaceous slate syenites oreenstones c in fact associated as submedial limestones often are in other parts of the world it should be remarked of this group of rocks that the most general dip of the mass composing the blue mountain range is to ne and ene most commonly at a considerable angle which dip is continued into the northern part of st marys parish near carlton wood house but further north in the same parish the dip becomes reversed and is to the sw it continues s or se along the line of junction with the redsandstone and conglomerate to the agua alta so that the strata would seem to be arched in some parts of st marys the rocks however on the northern face of catherines peak dip to the ne the submedial strata of the eastern part of the island have a tendency to dip towards the sea in that direction thus the grauwacke between port antonio and the rio grande in the vicinity of golden vale estate dips to the se and ese and some of the beds on the cunha cunha road sink to the eastward trap rocks associated icith the submedial rocks although it by no means follows that because trap rocks are associated with submedial rocks they should be of the same age with them or formed at the same geological epoch yet as a matter of convenience it may be as well to notice here the rocks of this nature occurring among the submedial rocks of jamaica though they very much resemble other trap rocks of the same island which are connected with a porphyritic conglomerate of more recent formation to be mentioned in the sequel that we should not always refer trap rocks to a more distant period of formation than the rocks which appear to rest upon them is well shown in the section afforded by the cliffs near gouldtrop road in southern pembrokeshire where greenstone passing into syenite rises from beneath old redsandstone which seems to rest upon it although a continuation of the same trap afterwards rests upon contorted carboniferous limestone and coal measures opposite to the anchorage in gouldtrop road so that the same trap seen at one end of its course might be asserted judging only from position to have been formed at a period antecedent to the old redsandstone while viewed at the other it might be declared to be a newer formation than the carboniferous limestone and coal measures so it might happen with the trap of jamaica which might easily have been thrown up among the submedial rocks at the same period with the trap occurring among the newer rocks yet as an abundance of pebbles evidently derived from trap rocks are found among the red conglomerates which cover the submedial rocks of jamaica it is fair to infer that trap must have been associated with these latter rocks previous to the formation of the conglomerate there seems moreover every reason to suppose that trap rocks notwithstanding their general similarity of structure have been formed at distant and distinct periods one of these periods seems to have been that when the submedial or transition rocks were formed and to this period may probably be referred that portion of the jamaica trap rocks which i am about to mention though from the want of good sections their connexion with the submedial rocks of this island is rather obscure i observed trap rocks in considerable abundance upon the southern side of the blue mountain range also upon that portion of it known as the cold ridge and in the highest parts of the blue mountain peak ascending towards the blue mountain peaks by sheldon abbey green and portland gap i observed syenite composed of white and fleshcoloured felspar colourless quartz and greenish black hornblende in considerable abundance between sheldon and abbey green near farm hill this syenite seemed to beassociated with grauwacke in what manner however it would be difficult to say as their relative position was very obscure greenstone white felspar and blackish green hornblende the grains being of a moderate size is seen singularly mixed up with slate and limestone immediately above abbey green house and between this place and portland gap an association of porphyry slate resembling grauwacke slate greenstone and limestone will be met with the porphyry is principally of a dark claystone or trappean base with white crystals of felspar varying in size in different places the ridge which extends from portland gap to the base of that from which the blue mountain peaks rise here and there presents where the tangled and mosscovered roots will permit a portion of rock to appear that variety of trap which is not unfrequently observable in districts composed of this class of rocks it is not precisely a cornean but in some instances approaches it it occurs of a dark colour on this ridge and gives out an earthy smell when breathed upon on the ridge from whence the highest blue mountain rises i found a darkcoloured trappean rock containing a very few small crystals of felspar in the mass it gives out an earthy smell when breathed on and occasionally has a sandstone appearance the peaks seemed in a great measure composed of a similar substance i did not observe any greenstone syenite or porphyries upon the higher parts of the cold ridge or blue mountain peaks but merely the above rocks their connexion with well characterized trap is therefore not clear and they may be mere varieties of grauwacke or some other submedial rock though from their general appearance and their resemblance to rocks in some trappean districts elsewhere i am inclined to refer them to the trappean class trap will be observed mixed with argillaceous slate and grauwacke at the base of the blue mountain range between whitehall and bath st thomasintheeast it is exposed in the bed of the plantain garden river and is principally composed of a dark claystone porphyry with crystals of white felspar and of a rather earthy rock of a gray greenish and occasionally reddish colour traversed by numerous veins of a substance having a zeolitic character this rock forms some picturesque cliffs upon the river and presents no appearance of stratification trap rocks occur as before mentioned mixed with limestone and grauwacke on the first part of the ascent of the cunha cunha road from bath and in the valley of the sulphur river between the latter place and the hot spring the trap in these places is principally that last noticed varying in colour but not so much crossed by zeolitic veins as on the higher part of the plantain garden river medial or carboniferous rocks it is not without some hesitation that i refer the following rocks to this class particularly as i have only observed the strata which more immediately lead me to do so in one place these however so much resemble the coal measures of europe in mineralogical structure that though confined to a small place i conceived it would be better to class them for the present in this order but to commence with the lowest rocks or those which rest upon the submedial country above noticed on the southern side of catherines peak and in the higher part of the valley of the hope river which descends from it a series of compact sandstone and conglomerate rocks principally of a red colour will be observed there are others which are gray but they are more or less subordinate to the red the sandstone varies in texture from extremely hard and compact to rather friable the conglomerate also varies in its degree of hardness under greenwich hill a very good section is obtained of these strata which dip at about an angle of to the s w and therefore appear to rest unconformably upon the limestones gray sandstones and shaly slate of the northern side and summit of catherines peak the beds vary in thickness from to feet and are almost all red the sandstone is mostly siliceous and compact there are however beds of a marly red sandstone and marl insterstratified with the compact sandstones and conglomerates which latter are composed of rounded pieces of granite colourless quartz reddish and white felspar and black mica largegrained greenstone syenite quartz hornstone c from the size of a walnut to three or four inches in diameter these beds with those of slaty sandstone mixed with beds of compact gray siliceous sandstone seen on the ascent of the mountain crowned by catherines peak seem to compose the lowest part of this formation which appears to be of considerable thickness judging from the section afforded by the valley of the hope river and but for the very great difference of dips would seem to pass into the sub medial class but to continue the hope valley sectionat middleton house which i estimate from barometrical observations to be feet above the level of the sea thick beds of very compact gray siliceous sandstone are seen forming a high cliff to the west of the house these strata cross the river into the bed of which large blocks of sandstone and the conglomerate have fallen there are some marly strata above hopewell a little further down the river than middleton in which veins of white and rosecoloured gypsum occur these strata are mixed with others of sandstone and the whole seems to constitute a part of the same formation with the red and gray sandstones and conglomerates composing the upper portion of the hope valley section for rocks similar to the latter again come in between hopewell and the limestones of mount pleasant the beds here mentioned present a mixture of thick strata composed of siliceous sandstones with conglomerates formed of rounded pieces of older rocks and cemented by the same kind of siliceous sandstone occasionally interstratined with slaty sandstone the dip of these strata is generally at a considerable angle to the sw they are in some places perpendicular and appear to have suffered much disturbance at mount pleasant a blackish gray compact limestone comes in some of the beds of which are traversed by numerous veins of calcareous spar in general appearance very much resembling many beds of the carboniferous limestone in the vicinity of bristol such as that of clifton c i observed what appeared to be encrinal remains in the mount pleasant limestone as also sections of bivalve shells these limestone beds dip at about an angle of to the eastward which is by no means conformable to the mass of redsandstone and conglomerate rocks in which they seem in some measure included yet a collection of similar limestones not much more in the whole than or feet thick crosses a valley near the mount pleasant beds in an east and west direction and seems to be connected with them the same kind of limestone beds are found near flamstead house in the port royal mountains the dip is not clearly shown at this place but the limestones are associated in the same manner as those near mount pleasant and appear to be a continuation of them for patches of compact gray blue limestone may be seen in several places between flamstead and the botanical garden now mount pleasant is situated in a northwesterly direction from flamstead and this is precisely that of the redsandstones and conglomerates of the district for their direction is nw and se so that the mount pleasant limestones may be referred to the place i have assigned them notwithstanding the dip thick beds of yellowish and decomposed sandy rock occur in the vicinity of the above limestones both at flamstead and mount pleasant the limestones of the latter place appear to be succeeded for a short distance by sandstones and conglomerates resembling those above mentioned next in order above these appear nearly opposite the botanical garden a series of shale schistose sandstone and more compact sandstone beds which very closely resemble in mineralogical structure the coal measures of some parts of england and the probability of their being such becomes the greater from the circumstance that thin seams of coal are observed among them i met with only three of these seams of not more than an inch and an inch and a half in thickness how numerous they may be it would be difficult to say as the section presented was of no great size yet i do not suspect that there are any beds of this substance that would be worth working for useful purposes the general dip of these beds is to the sw sometimes at a considerable angle they therefore dip conformably with the sandstone and conglomerate rocks on which they seem to rest i searched in vain for the vegetable impressions generally termed coal plants from being found among the true coal measures which these beds nevertheless very much resemble they are covered by a brownish red conglomerate principally composed of rounded pieces of porphyry mixed with pebbles of other trap rocks sandstones c the whole being associated with porphyries and trap rocks this conglomerate would appear referable to the same epoch of formation as the rothe todte liegende of the germans according to some geologists the whole of the rocks here enumerated might be included under the head of redsandstone gres rouge the coal measures being merely subordinate humboldt conceives that le gres houiller et le porphyre constituent une meme formation rothes todies liegende variable daspect et dune structure souvent trescompliqueef and daubisson states that la grande formation de gres houiller se divise tresconvenablement en deux parties lune comprend le terrain houiller proprement dit et lautre le gres appele dans la thuringe gres rouge avec ses couches subordonnees mais tout en distinguant ces deux parties nous remarquerons quelles appartiennent a la meme formation et quoique le terrain houiller soit le plus souvent audessous il lui arrive quelquefois detre entremele et meme detre superpose au gres rouge j the same author again remarks that le gres masse principale du terrain houiller prend souvent une grande extension en abandonnant au moins en majeure partie la houille avec iargile schisteuse qui lenveloppe et il constitue des terrains dune grande etendue ii a ete principalement observe en thuringe ou il est connu sous le nom de rothetodteliegende viewing these sandstones and conglomerates in the manner of many continental geologists they would form one mass with the porphyritic conglomerate to be mentioned hereafter humboldt considers the whole as one formation when describing the gres rouge of new spain venezuela new grenada the plateau of quito peru and the banks of the amazon which the jamaica rocks under consideration will be found very much to resemble dr buckland and mr conybeare remark on this subject that in the southwestern coal district of england we have three formations of red sandstone the newer red sandstone the millstone grit and the old red sandstone all liable to be confounded with one another owing to their prevailing red colour and to their containing beds of conglomerate and as similar rocks occur very similarly placed in various parts of the earths surface we find three opinions maintained concerning redsandstone and each moreover supported by indisputable facts one that it lies over the coal measures another that it lies beneath them and a third that it is a member of the coal formation the millstone grit affords the best example in the southwestern coalfield of a red sandstone belonging to the coal measures but occasionally even in this coalfield and very frequently in the coal districts on the continent all the coalgrits acquire a red colour and for this reason we now find it to be the prevailing opinion among the continental geologists that the gres rouge is a member of the coal formation in fact supposing the red conglomerate occurring between the magnesian limestone and coal measures the latter and the old red sandstone to come together the carboniferous limestone being wanting and the coalgrits generally red it would be most difficult to say where the one begins or the other ends and i consider this to be the case in jamaica for although in the valley of the hope river the rocks which i take to represent the coal measures do present a marked appearance for a short space they seem included among the red sandstones with regard to the other places in jamaica where i have observed the red sandstones and conglomerates the map will express better than words the space occupied by them i shall therefore only offer remarks on those places where sections may in some measure be obtained upon the summit of st georges gap thick beds of red sandstone are observable which with numerous similar beds interstratified with red conglomerates dip to the s w on the southern side of the mountain and as before observed strata which bear considerable resemblance to these are found associated with the submedial rocks on the northern face of the same mountain this circumstance would make it appear probable that the red sandstone passes into the grauwacke if it were not for the very sudden change of dip in the two red sandstones on both sides of the mountain descending from st georges gap to the kingston plain on the south beds of red sandstone and conglomerate are met with precisely resembling those that occur on the hope river of which indeed they form the continuation st georges gap being part of catherines peak ridge these are succeeded and covered by a lightcoloured sandstone most probably the same that occurs near the limestone and coal measures on the hope river i did not however perceive any of the latter rocks on the descent from the gap the agua alta or wag water presents a section of red sandstones and conglomerates which would appear to be a continuation of those above described and which are particularly interesting as an evident passage takes place between them and the grauwacke sandstones and conglomerates of st marys the road from annotto bay to scots hall maroon town traverses some elevated land in order to avoid a great bend in the agua alta where the ugly river flows into it the grauwacke which is here principally composed of thick conglomerate beds contains a few strata of a red colour these afterwards become more numerous to the exclusion of the gray beds slaty beds of the latter colour may however be occasionally observed among the red sandstones some little distance to the south of the elevated land these rocks therefore seem to pass into one another in fact the change is at first scarcely more than that of colour the component parts of the gray and red beds closely resembling each other the lower beds of old red sandstone sometimes graduate as is well known into grauwacke upon which it reposes therefore if the st marys rocks be considered as grauwacke we may not unfairly conclude that the sandstones and conglomerates of scots hall maroon town represent the old red sandstones of the english series from the circumstance of old red sandstone passing into grauwacke it is usual for continental geologists to consider it as a variety of the latter rock humboldt does so in his essai geognostique sur le gisement des roches p and divides it from the gres rouge of the french and the rothe todte liegende of the german geologists to which latter rock an eminent british geologist considers it should be referred a short distance to the south of scots hall maroon town these sandstones and conglomerates disappear and are succeeded by trap rocks their dip varies but is principally to the southward i observed it once se on the elevated land where these beds pass into grauwacke at green castle situated on a mountain a short distance westward from scots hall maroon town these red sandstones and conglomerates are well exposed as also between green castle and konigsburg estate the conglomerates in these places are principally composed of rounded pieces of trappean rocks and among the latter are greenstones and beautiful porphyries the beds dip at about to the sw near green castle but they are nearly perpendicular not far from the same place on the road to konigsburg the strata dip in some places to the nw among the contents of a conglomerate bed near green castle house found a rolled agate and a rounded piece of green carbonate of copper a considerable number of porphyry pebbles are found in the conglomerates on the banks of the river by which the road passes from the green castle to konigsburg this causes the rock more to resemble the red conglomerates of teignmouth c in devonshire than old red sandstone yet as porphyries are much mixed with those jamaica rocks that are inferior to it more particularly in the blue mountain district there seems no reason why rolled pieces of that substance should not occur abundantly in these conglomerates which rest on them a passage of these rocks into the grauwackelooking rocks of st marys will be observed near konigsburg where the red beds become extremely marly and pass into a gray shaly slate much mixed up with the grauwacke of st marys after all there may be a mixture of rothe todte liegende and old red sandstone in this district between which it would be almost impossible to distinguish on the buff bay river and on the southward of charles town there are thick beds of red sandstone and conglomerate which pass as before stated into the submedial rocks of that district these beds very much resemble those at the head of the hope river and very probably belong to the same epoch of formation among the port royal mountains a considerable quantity of these rocks will be observed closely agreeing in composition with the red sandstones and conglomerates of the hope river of which in fact they form the continuation between guava ridge and the yallahs river but nearest the latter place there are thick beds of very compact siliceous sandstone which apparently belong to the red sandstone formation of jamaica some parts of it are so quartzose as to resemble m von humboldts description of his roche de quartz secondaire which he mentions as occurring in the andes of peru between the th and th degrees of southern latitude he states that this rock is less developed on the eastern than on the western side of these mountains and that on the latter it is many thousand feet thick and replaces the gres rouge near cocoa walk estate on the yallahs river st davids twisted beds of brown conglomerate in which porphyry pebbles are abundant are seen by the road side on the right bank of the river these are much mixed with slate clay which is also twisted and contorted and resembles that found among the coal measures of the hope river these rocks are also observable on the left bank beneath a mountain capped by the white limestone formation and the whole of the conglomerate and slaty beds are referrible to the rocks under consideration supermedial or secondary rocks porphyritic conglomerate associated with porphyry and other trap rocks these rocks would according to the views of those geologists who consider red sandstone gres rouge as one great formation in which coal measures are subordinate be classed with the red sandstones and conglomerates above noticed i have however here separated them as they are in jamaica associated in a remarkable manner with porphyry and trap rocks which the others are not the great characteristic of the conglomerate is that the pebbles contained in it are principally and in some cases entirely composed of various kinds of porphyry and are almost always of some kind of trap rock the cementing matter is most frequently a reddish brown argillaceous substance of various degrees of hardness and the cement is in some places so obscure that the pebbles have the appearance of being joined together by a trappean substance i refer these rocks to the same epoch of formation as the porphyritic conglomerates of exeter and teignmouth which are by many considered as the english equivalent to the german rothe todte liegende or that part of it which rests upon the coal measures the rocks of this geological epoch are often as is well known found associated with porphyry which has obtained the name of porphyre secondaire with the french and porphyr gebirge with the germans in like manner the porphyritic conglomerate of jamaica is so much mixed with porphyries and other trap rocks that it will be necessary to describe them together the rocks cover what i have considered as coal measures nearly opposite the botanical garden on the hope river and continue from thence to where the valley opens upon the liguanea plain near the hope tavern most of the conglomerate beds are here of a reddish brown colour and are composed of rounded pieces of porphyries principally claystone of various greenstones and other trap rocks cemented by an argillaceous substance which in some cases passes into a kind of trappean claystone the general dip of the beds is at about an angle of to the sw and their thickness varies from two to ten feet these strata are associated in an obscure manner with porphyry in one place the latter rock with a dark claystone base containing crystals of white felspar has the appearance of a bed interstratified with the conglomerate but this may as dr macculloch has shown easily occur without the porphyry or trap actually forming a bed not far from the hope tavern there is a porphyry with a reddish brown trappean base containing white crystals of felspar and higher up the valley there is another with a compact felspathic base containing crystals of white felspar and a few small grains of quartz by reference to the accompanying map it will be seen that trap and porphyritic conglomerate extend from that mentioned on the hope river northwesterly into st marys and southeasterly through port royal parish to the yallahs river in st davids i shall in the first place enumerate the rocks and the changes they undergo in this range of country which for some distance separates the red sandstones and conglomerates from the white limestone formation occurring beneath the latter and above the former on the lower part of the descent from st georges gap to the plain of liguanea brownish red porphyritic conglomerate agreeing with that of the hope valley covers the red sandstones and conglomerates and is here and there mixed with greenstone apparently resting upon this and on the lowest part of the descent a considerable mass of syenite comes in very closely resembling that found among the submedial country between sheldon and abbey green though here associated with more recent rocks this syenite plunges beneath the inclined diluvial plain of liguanea which abuts against it a few occasional patches of white limestone only intervening the agua alta presents a good section of these rocks between the northern base of stony hill and scots hall maroon town near the former place brownish red porphyritic conglomerate occurs beneath the lower marls of the white limestone formation and is succeeded by porphyries and other trap rocks of various composition and structure the whole of which may be considered as one great mass with sometimes one ingredient predominating and sometimes another it should here be remarked that the trap of jamaica is often very much decomposed to a considerable depth so as not to be always immediately recognised but by careful examination hard portions will be found forming cliffs beds of rivers c where the structure can be examined this decomposition of the jamaica trap principally takes place in those varieties in which felspar forms a considerable portion of the mass it would therefore seem to arise from the decomposition of this mineral which has given way before the effects of a tropical climate a mountain of syenite composed of greenish black hornblende fleshcoloured felspar and colourless quartz the latter mineral being rare rises above golden spring estate st andrews on the agua alta this syenite resembles that of the descent from st georges gap and is most probably a continuation of it to enumerate all the varieties of trap found on the agua alta would be tedious it will be sufficient to state that porphyries greenstones and syenites seem to pass into each other one rock however which occurs about two miles south from scots hall maroon town deserves attention being wholly or very nearly so composed of two varieties of felspar differing in colour so as to have the appearance of syenite at a short distance this rock would seem referrible to that variety of compact felspar which dr macculloch denominates crystallinegranular f the felspar however of the rock in question is common not compact but as that author remarks that it seems doubtful whether this variety does not sometimes consist of an aggregation of common instead of compact felspar it appears to be a rock of that class the road over the hills from stony hill to
