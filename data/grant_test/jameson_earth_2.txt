of forth not only in exposed but also in sheltered situations and the solid strata as well as the looser alluvial formations which owe their origin to the destroying agency of the ocean at a former period are again yielding to its action at saint andrews the famous castle of cardinal beaton which is said originally to have been some distance from the sea now almost overhangs it from st andrews northward to eden water and the river tay the coast presents a sandy beach and is so liable to shift that it is difficult to trace the change it may have undergone it is certain however that within this last century the sea has made such an impression upon the sands of barrey on the northern side of the tay that the lighthouses at the entrance of the river which were formerly erected at the southern extremity of buttonness have been from time to time removed about a mile and a quarter further northward on account of the wasting and shifting of these sandy shores and that the spot on which the outer lighthouse stood in the th century is now two or three fathoms under water and is at least three quarters of a mile within floodmark note p on the growth of coral islands of all the genera of lithophytes the madrepore is the most abundant it occurs most frequently in tropical countries and decreases in number and variety as we approach the poles it encircles in prodigious rocks and vast reefs many of the basaltic and other rocky islands in the south sea and indian ocean and by its daily growth adds to their magnitude the coasts of the islands in the west indies also those of the islands on the east coast of africa and the shores and shoals of the red sea are encircled and incrusted with rocks of coral several different tribes of madrepore contribute to form these coral reefs but by far the most abundant are those of the genera carophylla astrea and meandrina these hthophytic animals not only add to the magnitude of land already existing but according to some naturalists they form whole islands dr forster in his observations made during a voyage round the world gives an account of the formation of these coral islands in the south sea all the low isles he says seem to me to be a production of the sea or rather its inhabitants the polypelike animals forming the lithophytes these animalcules raise their habitation gradually from a small base always spreading more and more in proportion as the structure grows higher the materials are a kind of lime mixed with some animal substances i have seen these large structures in all stages and of various extent near turtle island we found at a few miles distance and to leeward of it a considerable large circular reef over which the sea broke every where and no part of it was above water it included a large deep lagoon to the east and northeast of the society isles are a great many isles which in some parts are above water in others the elevated parts are connected by reefs some of which are dry at low water and others are constantly under water the elevated parts consist of a soil formed by a sand of shells and coral rocks mixed with a light black mould produced from putrified vegetables and the dung of seafowls and are commonly covered by cocoanut trees and other shrubs and a few antiscorbutic plants the lower parts have only a few shrubs and the above plants others still lower are washed by the sea at highwater all these isles are connected and include a lagoon in the middle which is full of the finest fish and sometimes there is an opening admitting a boat or canoe in the reef but i never saw or heard of an opening that would admit a ship the reef or the first origin of these isles is formed by the animalcules inhabiting the lithophytes they raise their habitation within a little of the surface of the sea which gradually throws shells weeds sand small bits of corals and other things on the tops of these coral rocks and at last fairly raises them above water where the above things continue to be accumulated by the sea till by a bird or by the sea a few seeds of plants that commonly grow on the seashore are thrown up and begin to vegetate and by their annual decay and reproduction from seeds create a little mould yearly accumulated by the mixture with sand increasing the dry spot on every side till another sea happens to carry a cocoanut hither which preserves its vegetative power a long time in the sea and therefore will soon begin to grow on this soil especially as it thrives equally in all kinds of soil and thus may all these low isles have become covered with the finest cocoanut trees the animalcules forming these reefs want to shelter their habitation from the impetuosity of the winds and the power and rage of the ocean but as within the tropics the winds blow commonly from one quarter they by instinct endeavour to stretch only a ledge within which is a lagoon which is certainly entirely screened against the power of both this therefore might account for the method employed by the animalcules in building only narrow ledges of coral rocks to secure in their middle a calm and sheltered place and this seems to me to be the most probable cause of the origin of all the tropical low isles over the whole south sea that excellent navigator the late captain flinders gives the following interesting account of the formation of coral islands particularly of halfway island on the north coast of terra australis mr chamisso who accompanied kotzebue in his voyage has published interesting observations on this subject he informs us that the low islands of the south sea and indian ocean owe their origin principally to the operations of several species of coral their situation with respect to each other as they often form rows their union in several places in large groups and their total absence in other parts of the same seas induce us to conclude that the corals have founded their building on shoals of the sea or to speak more correctly on the tops of mountains lying under water on the one side as they increase they continue to approach the surface of the sea on the other side they enlarge the extent of their earth the larger species of corals which form blocks measuring several fathoms in thickness seem to prefer the more violent surf on the external edge of the reef this and the obstacles opposed to the continuation of their life in the middle of a broad reef by the amassing of the shells abandoned by the animals and fragments of corals are probably the reason that the outer edge of the reef first approaches the surface as soon as it has reached such a height that it remains almost dry at low water the corals leave off building higher seashells fragments of coral shells of echini and their broken off prickles are united by the burning sun through the medium of the cementing calcareous sand which has arisen from the pulverization of the above mentioned shells into one whole or solid stone which strengthened by the continual throwing up of new materials gradually increases in thickness till it at last becomes so high that it is covered only during some seasons of the year by the high tides the heat of the sun so penetrates the mass of stone when it is dry that it splits in many places and breaks of in flakes these flakes so separated are raised one upon another by the waves at the time of high water the always active surf throws blocks of coral frequently of a fathom in length and three or four feet thick and shells of marine animals between and upon the foundation stones after this the calcareous sand lies undisturbed and offers to the seeds of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves a soil upon which they rapidly grow to overshadow its dazzling white surface entire trunks of trees which are carried by the rivers from other countries and islands find here at length a resting place after their long wanderings with them come some small animals such as lizards and insects as the first inhabitants even before the trees form a wood the real seabirds nestle here strayed landbirds take refuge in the bushes and at a much later period when the work has been long since completed man also appears builds his hut on the fruitful soil formed by the corruption of the leaves of the trees and calls himself lord and proprietor of this new creation in the preceding account we have seen how the exterior edge of a submarine coral edifice first approaches the surface of the water and how this reef gradually assumes the properties of land the island therefore necessarily has a circular form and in the middle of it an inclosed lake this lake however is not entirely inclosed and it could not be for without supply from the sea it would soon be dried up by the rays of the sun but the exterior wall consists of a great number of smaller islands which are separated from each other by sometimes larger sometimes smaller spaces the number of these islets amounts in the larger coral islands to sixty and between them it is not so deep but that it becomes dry at the time of ebb the interior sea has in the middle generally a depth of from thirty to fiveand thirty fathoms but on all sides towards the land the depth gradually increases in those seas where the constant monsoons prevail where consequently the waves beat only on one side of the reef or island it is natural that this side of the reef exposed to the unremitting fury of the ocean should be formed chiefly by brokenoff blocks of coral and fragments of shells and first rise above the elements that created it it is only these islands respecting the formation and nature of which we hitherto know any thing with certainty we are almost entirely without any observations on those in the indian and chinese sea which lie in the regions of the six months monsoons from the charts given of them it is to be inferred that every side is equally advanced in formation the leeside of such a coral reef in the pacific ocean which is governed by the constant monsoons frequently does not shew itself above the water when the opposite side from time immemorial has attained perfection in the atmospheric region the former reef is even interrupted in many places by intervals tolerably broad and of the same depth as the inner sea which have been left by nature like open gates for the exploring mariner to enter the internal calm and secure harbour in their external form the coral islands do not resemble each other but this and the extent of each probably depends on the size of the submarine mountain tops on which their basis is founded those islands which have more length than breadth and are opposed in their greatest extent to the winds and waves are richer in fruitful islets than those whose situation is not so adapted to a quick formation in the large islandchains there are always some single islets which have the appearance of high land these lie upon an angle projecting into the sea are exposed to the surf upon two sides consist therefore almost entirely of large blocks of coral and are destitute of smaller fragments of shells and coral sand to fill up the intervals they are therefore not adapted to support plants requiring a depth of soil and only afford a basis to high trees provided with fibrous roots as the pisonia cordia sebastiana l morinda citrifolia l and pandanus odoratissimus l which at a distance give to these always very small islands the form of a hill the inner shores of the island exposed to the surf consist of fine sand which is washed up by the tide between the small islands under their protection and even in the middle of the inner sea are found smaller pieces of coral which seek a quiet abode form in time though very slowly banks till they at last reach the surface of the water gradually increase in extent unite with the islands that surround them and at length fill up the minor seas so that what was at first a ring of islands becomes one connected land the islands which are so far formed retain in the middle a flat plain which is always lower than the wall that surrounds them on the banks for which reason pools of water are formed in them after a continued rain the only springs and wells they possess one of the peculiarities of these islands is that no dew falls in the evening that they cause no tempests and do not check the course of the wind the very low situation of the country sometimes exposes the inhabitants to great danger and threatens their lives when the waves roll over their islands if it happens that the equinox and full moon fall on the same day consequently when the water has reached its greatest height and a storm agitates the sea at the same time these islands are said to be also shaken by earthquakes mm quoy and gaimard in a lately published memoir propose to examine how corals raise their habitations upon rocks and what circumstances are favourable or unfavourable to their growth st to shew that there are no islands of any extent constantly inhabited by man which are entirely formed of corals and that far from raising from the depths of the ocean perpendicular walls as has been alleged these animals form only layers or crusts of a few fathoms thickness the following according to the french naturalists is the manner in which this addition or superposition of madrepores is effected in the places where the heat is constantly intense where the land is indented by bays containing shallow and quiet water which is not liable to be agitated by great surges or by the regular breezes of the tropics there also the saxigenous polypi multiply they construct their habitations on the submarine rocks envelope these rocks in whole or in part but do not form them properly speaking thus all those reefs those girdles of madrepore which are so frequently met with in the south sea to the leeward of islands are shoals depending upon the conformation of the original ground which will be perceived to belong to it when the direction of the mountains and hills has been attentively observed it is always where the slopes are gentle and the sea shallowest that the greatest masses of madrepores are found they sprout up if it is calm in the contrary case they form only scattered tufts belonging to species which seem to be least affected by the agitation of the waters it has been said and it is even a matter of general belief among mariners say mm quoy and gaimard that there occur in the equatorial seas shoals composed of corals which rise from the greatest depths like walls at the bottom of which the sounding line finds no ground the fact certainly does exist in so far as regards the depth spoken of and it is this very circumstance which is productive of so much danger to vessels which when taken in a calm and carried away by currents cannot cast anchor in such places but it is not correct to say that these reefs are entirety formed of madrepores first because the species which always form the most considerable banks such as some meandrinae certain caryophylleae but especially the astreae adorned with the most beautiful and velvety colours require the influence of light to perfect them because they are not seen to grow beyond a few yards of depth and because they cannot consequently be developed at a depth of ten or twelve hundred feet as they would necessarily be did they raise the cliffs in question besides these different species of animals would then almost exclusively enjoy the privilege of living at all depths under all degrees of pressure and so to speak in all temperatures another circumstance to which navigators have not adverted which corroborates the opinion here stated that in depths so great as those to which we allude the sea always agitated at the surface breaks with force upon these reefs without requiring for that purpose any additional impulse from the winds and by merely attending to the necessary consequences of the observations of these same navigators who say what is very true that wherever the waves are agitated the lithophytes are unable to go on with their work because they destroy their frail edifices we shall acquire the moral certainty that these submarine steeps are not produced by these animalcules but in these same places let there occur a hollow a sheltered spot of some kind and then they will immediately raise then habitations and will contribute to diminish the little depth that already exists there and this is what may be seen in almost all the places where an elevated temperature permits these animals to grow in abundance in the localities where the tides are sensible their currents alone may sometimes form irregular canals between the madrepores without their ever being encumbered with their species from the twofold cause united of the motion and the coldness of the water while on the other hand the flexible alcyonia are seen to multiply there when these geological dispositions are carefully observed we see that the zoophytes rise to the surface of the waves never beyond it after which the generation which has attained thus far appears to die it is destroyed much sooner if from the effect of the tides these frail animalcules are exposed naked to the action of a burning sun when there occur small hollows in these heaps of inert spoils deprived of their inhabitants which are always covered by the water several tufts of those lithophytes are still remarked which having escaped from the almost general destruction glow with the most lively colours then the families which are developed anew not being able to build on the outside of those reefs on which the sea is constantly breaking draw nearer and nearer the shore where the waves now deadened have scarcely any more action upon them as in the isle of france at timor the papua the marian and the sandwich islands provided always the waters had not a great depth as is the case at turtle island of which cook speaks where no bottom is found between the madrepore reefs and the island notwithstanding the shortness of the space which exists between these two points if we examine these animals in the places best adapted to their growth we shall see their different species the forms of which as varied as they are elegant become rounded into balls spread out into fans or ramify into trees mingling together blending with each other and reflecting the varied hues of red yellow blue and violet it is well known that all these alleged walls exclusively formed of corals are intersected with openings through which the sea enters and retires with violence and every body knows the danger which captain cook ran on one occasion on the coast of new holland when he had no other resource in order to save himself from destruction than to take the sudden resolution of attempting one of these narrow passes where one is always sure of finding plenty of water and this circumstance also comes in support of what we have advanced for if these perpendicular walls were entirely composed of madrepores they would present no deep openings in their continuity because it is the property of zoophytes to build in masses that have no interruption and because again could they raise themselves from very great depths they would end with encumbering and shutting up these passages a circumstance which does not take place and probably never will from the causes which we have related if these facts prove that madrepores cannot exist at very great depths the submarine rocks which they only increase in height are not therefore exclusively formed by them we now come to the second part of the argument and we assert that there are no islands of any magnitude and constantly inhabited by man that are formed by corals and that the layers which they construct under the water are not more than a few fathoms in thickness we shall commence with the second part of this question the impossibility of penetrating to the bottom of the sea to examine at what precise depth the solid zoophytes establish themselves constrains us to confine ourselves to what has taken place in former times and the monuments which the ancient revolutions of the globe have disclosed to our view will serve to prove what is going on in our own days we shall mention what has been seen in several places and we shall first speak of the island which peron took for the theatre of the great works of these polypi namely the island of timor the banks of coral which the sea has left exposed the land as it retired are remarkable for their uncommon magnitude the whole shores of coupang are formed of them and the low hills in its vicinity are enveloped in them but a few hundred yards from the town they disappear when distinct strata of slate make their appearance the corals form a bed over the subjacent rocks from to feet thick every thing announces that in the island of timor there exist no mountains exclusively formed of corals as in all extensive countries they are composed of various substances quoy and gaimard having coasted it for about fifty leagues sufficiently near to enable them to form an idea of its geography were able to see that it exhibited volcanic appearances in several parts besides it abounds in mines of gold and copper which in conjunction with what we have already mentioned shews in a general way the nature of the rocks of which it is composed perhaps remarks quoy and gaimard the baldhead a mountain of king georges harbour in new holland which vancouver has described in passing and on the summit of which he saw perfectly preserved branches of coral might be adduced as a fact in opposition to the opinion here advanced yet the phenomenon exhibited there is still precisely the same as at timor and in a thousand other places the zoophytes have built upon a basis previously existing and they occupy only the surface of it for why should this baldhead differ from mount gardner which although close by it is formed of primitive rocks besides peron says that it has the same geological constitution t ii p at rota one of the marian isles m gaudichaud detached from the limestone rock at about a hundred toises above the level of the sea branches of true madrepores in perfect preservation here are then three localities in which they are found at great heights we have observed them say the french naturalists at infinitely lower elevations in several other places as at the isle of france where they form a bed more than six feet thick between two streams of lava at wahou one of the sandwich islands where they have not a greater elevation but extend for several hundred toises over the surface of the island in all these cases it is necessary to distinguish between the lithophytes which have by their living powers formed continuous masses from those which after having been rolled about broken down by the water and mixed with sea shells contribute to form those deposits known by the name of madrepore limestone the latter sort is nothing but the debris of the former deposits of this description occur in the marian isles and in those of the papous they occur also on the coasts of france and in several other places it would appear from observations made in timor and other places that the species of the genus astraea which are the only ones capable of covering immense extents of surface do not commence their operations at a greater depth than twentyfive or thirty feet in order to raise their habitations to near the surface of the sea fragments of these species are never obtained either with the sounding line or upon the anchors nor do we ever see them unless in places where the water is shallow while the branched madrepores which do not form thick and continuous beds either on the elevated places which the ocean has left or on the shores where they still exist live at considerable depths it is evident then that these corals have erected their fabrics on the summits of submarine hills and mountains and that all those reefs of taiti the dangerous archipelago navigators islands the friendly islands c are composed of madrepores only at the surface we thus consider it demonstrated that the rocks of the solid zoophytes or coral are not capable of forming the immense bases on which the greater number of the islands that occur in the pacific ocean rest there now remains for us to state how these animals by their union are capable of raising small islets forster as already stated has given a very good description of the manner in which this is effected in fact when these animalcules have raised their habitations to the surface of the water under the shelter of the land and they remain uncovered during the reflux of the tide the hurricanes which sometimes supervene by the agitation which they produce in those shallow waters throw up from the bottom sand and mud these substances are detained in the sinuosities and cavities formed between the corals and thus serve to fix them together and connect them into masses whenever the summit of this new island can remain constantly uncovered by the sea and the waves can no longer destroy what they themselves have contributed to form then its extent is enlarged and its edges are gradually raised by the successive addition of sand according to the direction of the winds and currents they may long remain sterile but if the seeds of vegetables be transported to them from the neighbouring shores by the action of these two causes then in latitudes favourable to their development we presently see these islands becoming covered with verdure the successively accumulated remains of which form layers of soil which contribute to the elevation of the surface but in order that this phenomenon of growth be accomplished the distance from land must not be too great because then the vegetables cannot get so easily to the islets in question which then remain almost always bare and sterile and for this reason what navigators report of those madrepore islands of the great ocean which are covered with verdure and are yet at a great distance from any known land has always appeared to us extraordinary and that so much the more that in those vast spaces the violence of the waves which nothing can break there must disturb the operations of the zoophytes we do not however deny the existence of these islands which it would be interesting carefully to examine anew for whenever navigators meet with low islands between the tropics they do not hesitate in compliance with the generally received opinion to say that they consist of madrepores yet how many islands which scarcely rise above the surface of the water recognise no such origin we may mention as an example the island of boni situated under the equator the beautiful vegetation of which rises upon limestone cocoa island near guam is in the same condition being also composed of limestone in general if they are inhabited consequently they have springs or lakes of fresh water we may almost be certain that they are not composed of lithophytes or are only so in part because springs could not be formed in their porous substances some of the caroline isles are excessively low we supposed them encrusted with madrepores and as they have inhabitants there must be somewhere in them a soil favourable to the accumulation of fresh water in restraining the power of these animalcules concludes quoy and gaimard and in pointing out the limits which nature has prescribed them we have no other object than to furnish more correct data to the naturalists who aspire to great hypothetical considerations regarding the conformation of the globe on reconsidering these zoophytes with greater attention they will no longer be seen filling up the basins of the seas raising islands increasing the size of the continents threatening future generations with a solid equatorial circle formed of their spoils their influence with regard to the roadsteads or harbours in which they multiply is already great enough without adding more to it but compared with the masses on which they rest what are their layers often interrupted and which must be searched for with care before they can be recognised to the enormous volcanic peaks of the sandwich islands the island of bourbon the moluccas the marian islands the mountains of timor new guinea c sec nothing certainly and the solid zoophytes are in no degree capable of being compared with the testaceous mollusca with reference to the materials which they have furnished and still continue to furnish to the crust of the globe note i p on the level of the baltic about the middle of the last century a controversy took place among the natural philosophers of the north of europe regarding the alleged gradual lowering of the level of the sea in general and of the baltic sea in particular celsius was the first who introduced this idea to notice he generalised it by applying it to all the planets and was supported by the authority of the celebrated linnaeus he soon perceived however that the point could never be settled by mere discussion and that facts alone could lead to any certain result observation was therefore had recourse to and thus the dispute in question had at least one good effect that of directing to the subject the attention of men of science whose situation might enable them to mark the variations of level that take place along the coasts of the north sea the results of investigations undertaken for this purpose are now beginning to be collected in the course of and mr bruncrona assisted by the officers of the pilotage establishment and other qualified persons undertook the examination of all the authentic measures that had been established upon the west coast of the baltic during the last half century the results of this examination are given in a short memoir inserted in the swedish transactions for the following table indicates the degree to which the level of the sea has fallen during the last forty years on the coast of sweden at various latitudes it is proper to remark that in some of the places observed the measures were much older and in some others much more recent than the period of forty years in both these cases the change of level that must have been effected during this period has been estimated by calculating the mean annual depression furnished by the observations of the facts collected in the course of this investigation the following may be mentioned as tending to support the opinion of a fall of level st it is generally believed among the pilots of the baltic that the sea has become shallower along the course which vessels ordinarily follow but it is added that this alteration is more sensible in the places where the tide collects sand detached pebbles and seaweeds or in those where the bottom is composed of rocks the same observation has been made in the neighbourhood of some large towns and fisheries for example a hydrographic chart made in gives six fathoms for the mean depth of the sea opposite the harbour of landskrona whereas in the sounding line scarcely gave five fathoms at the same point d according to the oldest and most experienced pilots the straits which separate the numerous islets scattered along the coast of sweden from haarparanda to the frontiers of norway received vessels that drew ten feet of water now they are not practicable for boats that draw more than two or three feet d the pilots further affirm that along the whole coast of bahusia the bottom undergoes a diminution which becomes sensible every ten years in certain places where it is composed of rocks several other parts of the baltic may be cited in which a similar change has been remarked m c p hallstrom in an appendix to mr bruncronas memoir gives the following table of the diminution observed in the depth of the waters of the gulf of bothnia some authors consider the facts related by mm bruncrona and halstrom as deciding the question in favour of those who believe in a lowering of the level of the baltic the editor of the annalen der physik goes farther and seems to consider it as confirming the opinion of a general lowering of the level of the sea in support of this opinion he adduces the traditions and observations of the natives of otaheite and of the moluccas and sunda islands regarding the retreat of the sea in several parts of their coast we are disposed to stand neutral in this matter the geographers who have collected the greatest number of facts relating to the level of the inland seas and of the ocean in its various regions find nearly as many in favour of a rise as in favour of a fall of level the very distribution of contrary indications leads them to believe in a partial displacement of the mass of waters from one region towards another and even from the one side of an inland sea towards the opposite side a displacement which might be owing to fugitive or more or less durable causes such as a variation of temperature in the polar regions the action of winds and of currents modified by the greater or less quantity of water in the rivers that feed the different basins upon the sides opposed to their direction are the facts contained in the memoir in question of a nature to overthrow this opinion they do not appear so to us the two series of observations which are adduced only shew a fall upon the coasts of sweden properly so called that is to say upon the west coast of the baltic and the east coast of the cattegat two observations only have been made upon the coasts of finland toward the extremity of the gulf of bothnia these facts would perfectly accord with the opinion of those who think that the currents determined from the north to the south of the baltic by the numerous streams which rush into itj push the waters toward the south shore that of pomerania mecklenbourg and holstein and that the waters consequently gain upon the land on this coast as numerous historical facts attest while they retire along the northern shores those of the gulf of bothnia be this as it may the question as to the constancy of the level of the sea cannot be considered as decided until a long series of observations shall have been made upon authentic and perfectly fixed measures erected upon all jhe shores of the different seas and of the different regions of the ocean those which have been published in the swedish transactions furnish important documents for this purpose and similar ones should be begun to be collected in other countries the phenomena exhibited by the waters of the baltic engaged the attention of two rival speculators playfair and deluc and their views are often alluded to by geologists we shall here state them in their own words professor playfair in his well known and elegant work on the huttonian theory of the earth has the following remarks that indefatigable and accurate observer de luc has the following commentary on the preceding passage fossil remains of the human species from the observations of werner and others it appears that the most simple animals are those first met with in a mineralized state that these are succeeded by others more perfect and which are contained in newer formations and that the most perfect as quadrupeds occur only in the newest formation but we naturally inquire have no remains of the human species been hitherto discovered in any of the formations judging from the arrangement already mentioned we would naturally expect to meet with remains of man in the newest of the formations in the writings of ancient authors there are descriptions of anthropolithi in the year fel plater professor of anatomy at basle described several fossil bones of the elephant found at lucerne as those of a giant at least nineteen feet high the lucemese were so perfectly satisfied with this discovery that they caused a painting to be made of the giant as he must have appeared when alive assumed two such giants as the supporters of the city arms and had the painting hung in their public hall the landvoigt engel not satisfied with this account of these remains maintained that our planet before the creation of the present race of men was inhabited by fallen angels and that these bones were part of the skeletons of some of those miserable beings scheuchzer published an engraving and description of a fossil human skeleton which proved to be a gigantic species of salamander or proteus spallanzani describes a hill of fossil human bones in the island of cerigo but this also is an error as has been satisfactorily shewn by blumenbach lately however a fossil human skeleton has been imported into this country from guadaloupe by sir alexander cochrane it is imbedded in a block of calcareous stone composed of particles of limestone and coral and which like the aggregations of shells found on the limestone coasts in some parts of this country has acquired a great degree of hardness it is therefore an instance of a fossil human petrifaction in an alluvial formation the engraving here given is copied from the philosophical transactions of the royal society of london and the following description of the fossil remains it exhibits is that of mr konig which has been drawn up with great care note p on the universal deluge mr cuvier in the present work and more recently in a note to mr lemaires edition of ovids metamorphoses enumerates the mosaic grecian assyrian persian indian and chinese traditions concerning a universal deluge and concludes from them that the surface of the globe five or six thousand years ago underwent a general and sudden revolution by which the lands inhabited by the human beings who lived at that time and by the various species of animals known at the present day were overflowed by the ocean out of which emerged the present habitable portions of the globe this celebrated naturalist maintains that these regions of the earth were peopled by the few individuals who were preserved and that the tradition of the catastrophe has been preserved among these new races of people variously modified by the difference of their situation and their social disposition according to mr cuvier similar revolutions of nature had taken place at periods long antecedent to that of the mosaic deluge the dry land was inhabited if not by human beings at least by land animals at an earlier period and must have been changed from the dry land to the bed of the ocean and it might even be concluded from the various species of animals contained in it that this change as well as its opposite had occurred more than once this opinion being brought forward in a geognostic work especially in a work abounding in such valuable matters of fact and stated as the result of geognostic investigation we may be permitted in this point of view to examine it and to ask whether from the phenomena exhibited by the present condition of the earths surface we are entitled to conclude that it owes its conformation to such a universal deluge we know from arguments suggested by chemistry and the higher mechanics that the globe was once in a state of fluidity hence it might be maintained with some appearance of probability that the condition of the earth previous to the existence of organic matter depended upon fusion and that the primitive rocks are of igneous origin since however granite has been found above rocks of various kinds which contain the remains of organic bodies we are under no necessity of ascribing to primitive rocks an origin different from that of subsequent formations and without having recourse to other arguments the fact that aquatic animals are the most abundant of fossil organic remains from the earliest of the transition to the latest of the secondary and tertiary formations affords evidence that they are precipitates from water notwithstanding the great and daily advancement of science our knowledge of chemistry is still too imperfect for us to arrive at an adequate knowledge of the state of this water or rather sea as from its universal expansion it must be denominated did it contain dissolved in it at the same time all the materials from which the various beds of rock were formed what were the solvents of those materials which we find either insoluble in water or at least not easily soluble by what means were the precipitates produced and whence came this prodigious mass of waters upon these unanswered questions depend others no less important the aquatic animals of a formerworld undoubtedly lived in this sea otherwise we must admit of another sea free from heterogeneous materials but did these animals continue to live in it during the whole process of precipitation and did this process proceed so slowly and imperceptibly that animal life was not interrupted by it and that only remains of dead animals such as the skeletons of fishes and the covering of shellfishes were enveloped in the precipitates or did animal life continue only during the state of solution and were the myriads of aquatic animals found in beds of rocks buried in them alive many naturalists appear to entertain the latter opinion from observing the agonies of death depicted in the distorted position of fishes in copperslate or from deriving the bituminous properties of stinkstone as well as of marl from the decomposition of animal bodies of which such numerous vestiges are extant in these beds in this way a plausible explanation is given of the phenomena of a former world that has perished how then do they explain the constant appearance of so many species which have continued without interruption for such an infinite length of time have these species been propagated by individuals who accidentally escaped destruction or does a new race continually spring up again but laying aside the difficulty of this explanation the violent destruction of so many races of animals is scarcely consistent with the general order of the universe according to which we behold every animal occupying its proper element and fulfilling its particular destiny we therefore involuntarily revert to the opinion that those creatures whose remains are preserved in beds of rocks have lived continually in the sea out of which the rocks were precipitated in the same manner as the analogous species now living in the sea become enveloped in deposits still taking place although on a comparatively small scale what has just been said does not entitle us to admit that the various parts of the earth have been from time to time overflowed with water yet are there other appearances which completely indicate such a change namely beds of coal and the fossil remains of land animals the carbonisation of roots of trees in clefts of rocks and of marsh plants in peatbogs which takes place as it were under our own immediate observation the transitions of bituminous wood into pitchcoal the frequent presence of vegetables partly converted into coal in the neighbourhood of beds of coal and which are more abundant the nearer they are to these beds and finally the chemical nature of coal which is similar to that of vegetables go to prove the vegetable origin of the older and independent coal formation though some fossil vegetables might derive their origin by being floated to quarters more or less remote from their native soil as we find to be the case in many islands of the south sea and on other shores on the other hand neither the breadth and extent of beds of coal nor the erect position in which fossil trees and reed plants are not unfrequently found in their neighbourhood coincide with such an explanation the plants from which these beds were formed once stood and grew in the place where they were buried and from these remains we infer that they were entirely land plants treeferns lycopodia and other cryptogamia it also appears undeniable that the land being once dry was during a longer or shorter time covered with luxuriant vegetation that it was afterwards overflowed with water and then became dry land again but was this overflow of water produced by a sudden violent and universal catastrophe such as we consider the deluge many circumstances leave room for opposite conjecture if it is probable that the older or black coal is of vegetable origin the plants from which it has originated must have suffered an incomparably greater change than those of more recent coal formations their composition and their texture afford evidence of a long operation of the fluid in which the changes were produced and their situation proves that the substance of the plants though not entirely dissolved was yet much comminuted and was kept floating and swimming and then precipitated how can we in any other way account for the layers of sandstone and slateclay with which coal regularly alternates so that from one to sixty alternate beds have been enumerated how can we explain the combination of mineral coal with slateclay or account for the appearance of bituminous shale flinty slate of ironpyrites and ironore in the midst of mineral coal itself we do not however admit of a repeated uncovering and covering of the land with water and of a renewal of vegetation for every particular bed of coal far from it for violent inundations exhibit very different phenomena these formations like pure mineral formations bear the evident impress of a lengthened operation and of gentle precipitations and whoever still entertains doubts regarding this may have them completely removed by the condition in which vegetable remains are frequently found in the coal formations by the perfect preservation of the most delicately shaped fern leaves by the upright position of stems and by other appearances of a similar character it is also an important objection against the universality of the cover of water notwithstanding the wide extent of beds of coal that they are sometimes accompanied with fossil remains of freshwater shells from which we are entitled to draw the conclusion that they must have been deposited in inclosed basins of inland waters from the beds of coal found in various situations among alpine limestone as well as in other secondary formations under similar circumstances we are at liberty to maintain that they are not indebted for their origin to any universal and sudden revolution when we proceed to the second division of coal formations to brown coal or to lignite the principal difference we discover is that the change which the vegetables have undergone having taken place at a time when the chemical power had lost much of its energy was incomplete and besides we observe in the different brown coal formations the same repetition of single beds alternating with other beds of rocks the mixture of different minerals and not unfrequently of upright stems some appear to be derived from sea plants and others from freshwater plants but the greater proportion from land plants they equally with the beds of black coal give evidence of a new overflow of water and the water plants themselves which never thrive at a great depth and which frequently appear under prodigious beds of rocks must have experienced such a change but that change was scarcely of the kind which we understand by a deluge and the frequent repetition of deluges indicated according to some by the repeated beds of coal from the transition to the newest tertiary periods is hardly credible it may be maintained with more certainty of brown coal than of black coal that they have been formed in land water and hence in limited and isolated basins of water since freshwater animals are their constant attendants although the beds of coal of our secondary formations appear to have originated in a similar way with other mineral formations and not by violent catastrophes it is otherwise with a part of those vegetable remains which are met with in alluvial land subterranean forests whose circumference in some instances extends about square leagues partly in a state of good preservation and partly more or less decomposed afford satisfactory proof of deluges and have undoubtedly been covered up with earth by a violent eruption of standing or running water but these are local effects similar to what take place in our own day but on a larger scale there are abundant fossil remains of land animals resembling those of water animals found in such a state of preservation that we cannot suppose them to have been brought hither from distant places and by means of currents their appearing in beds of rocks or generally in aqueous precipitates proves that the soil they first inhabited must have been dry land afterwards overflowed with water the appearance of what are called fresh water shells in alternate beds with marine animals being sometimes observed in newer floetz rocks in great abundance seems to indicate a reiterated retreat and return of the sea but however meritorious the labours of naturalists through whom attention has been directed to the subject may be in other respects we are nevertheless disposed to entertain doubts concerning their conclusions in our own seas and ponds upon the coasts we observe the same testaceous animals growing equally well in salt water and in water nearly fresh and again fresh water animals living in salt water by artificial means the inhabitants of the sea may be changed into inhabitants of fresh water as freshwater animals are in their turn converted into marine animals so that to decide concerning the proper element of each individual species is often matter of difficulty therefore other circumstances besides that of containing salt must be taken into account the occasional plenty scarcity or absolute want of food the soil being sometimes sandy slimy or rocky the depth extent agitation or tranquillity of the water and finally the quality of the air contained in it may be as instrumental in determining the habitation of these animals as the materials which the water holds in solution an excellent observer has indeed very lately shewn in a treatise which supports the idea of freshwater formations that we possess no unerring character for distinguishing sea shellfish from those of fresh water but admitted notwithstanding the transition above stated we can draw a line of distinction between them we must not forget that this investigation is neither regarding sea shellfish now existing nor of our present waters we indeed draw our conclusion and not without reason from similar conformation similar modes of existence but one of two things must be either that the shellfish whose remains are found in beds of rocks lived in the water out of which these beds were precipitated or the water in which they lived was dislodged by other water containing the materials of the precipitations in the first and more generally admitted case the water was so different from the present water whether salt or fresh that we cannot infer from the inhabitants of the latter any thing concerning the inhabitants of the former but we can confidently maintain that a greater resemblance prevails between our sea and land water than between either the one or the other and that fluid which was inhabited by the shellfish in other respects there remains no other difference between fresh and salt water formations but that the bottom upon which the former is placed once contained land water a fact worthy of observation but the notion of enclosed basins and of isolated formations originating in them the way in which fresh water formations are supposed to have taken place remained a long time unsatisfactory finally we may be permitted to ask upon what grounds they considered themselves entitled to ascribe to the former sea the continual possession of a portion of salt while the salt precipitates appear only at particular intervals and after long interruptions if the sea occasionally contained a great and sometimes a very small quantity of salt it might equally be at times altogether without it and yet it deserves to be remembered that the beds of rock to which the salt formations are most nearly related contain no petrifactions that therefore the socalled marine animals are wanting in those periods during which we have any direct evidence of the presence of salt water there is however a geognostic fact which in preference to all others has been cited in evidence of violent revolutions and deluges that is the appearance of conglomerates or of reproduced kinds of stone indeed there might still be a wide field for investigation here and more than one formation which now passes for sandstone might be acknowledged as an original and chemical production without having occasion to go so far as mr gerhard does with greywacke that is to consider them as immediate precipitates from the atmosphere but still conglomerates sufficiently genuine will remain from the transition period through all the subsequent formations to serve as acknowledged monuments of destruction as well as of the renovation of what was destroyed these are the codices rescripti in the archives of the earth out of which the antiquarian will one day decipher the almost obliterated traces of her former condition as well as the history of her changes though these conglomerates deviate so much in their nature and in the character of their origin from chemical productions they have yet among themselves this remarkable and common characteristic that with few exceptions the older are much less varied in character and more extensive in distribution than the newer and that at length the newest conglomerates become mere local appearances but in reference to the main question which engages our attention we may conjecture that the beds of rocks from which the sea had never retreated might be assailed by its floods and currents and shattered to pieces as happens even in our own time and the fragments be again reunited into solid rocks by means of the still remaining dissolved matter in the water but of many conglomerates it is evident that they have been deposited on the dry land in the same way as our gravels jupiter who took counsel with himself whether he would destroy the sinful world with fire or water and at length decided for water may not be so justly considered the author of these appearances as saturn who devoured his children or to be less metaphorical in our language it may perhaps have been with the origin of conglomerates as it is in our own day with the origin of fragments of rock and boulders in which the rock being fractured in various places by the alternations of heat and cold by the influence of air and atmospheric water falls into pieces of greater or smaller magnitude which are carried forward by the water and gradually rounded in their progress so that they assume a more perfectly globular shape the farther they are removed from their original situation therefore as regards the foregoing enquiry it is not an unimportant circumstance that the long but continual rolling of the boulders during their rounding appears to be much more efficacious than a rapid and violent impetus and that in this case as in many other geognostic appearances time rather than force is to be taken into account another circumstance perhaps corresponds with this that the change produced by the weather not only by the first disunion but also by the progressive disintegration of the rocks by the blunting of the edges and corners by the diminution of the fragments and generally in the origin of the boulders and fragments of rocks of every description has just as much influence as the mechanical operation of the water and that a great part of the land called alluvial generally owes its existence to this cause but if upon farther consideration the conglomerates appear to derive their origin in a similar way with rolled masses of gravel they afford evidence nevertheless of the elevated station of the water in the neighbourhood from which they had been before removed for their conglomeration could take place only under water and with few exceptions they occupy an incomparably greater elevation than any of the coal formations or any of the beds of rocks which enclose the remains of land animals geognosy certainly contains many facts which cannot be explained but by a change from dry land to the bottom of the sea although our knowledge of them is still so imperfect that we cannot hazard a probable conjecture respecting the numbers of these changes whether they commence at the same or at different periods in the various quarters of the world and whether they are local or universal these changes appear neither sudden nor violent such as we consider revolutions of the earth but at all times proceed with silent and regular steps and depend upon similar causes concealed it is true from us such as the universal retreat of the waters from their original height to the present bed of the ocean we do not belong to those geologists who divert the world from its axis for the purpose of explaining the inequalities of its surface at whose command the earth sometimes opens her bosom to engulf the sea and at other times the floodgates of heaven are lifted up to pour down another ocean he who reflects on the devastation caused by earthquakes inundations and the fall of mountains even though they are merely local appearances confined to particular quarters cannot help putting the question to himself how the order regularity and connection exhibited by strata of rocks could in any measure exist if the same or similar accidents had happened throughout the whole world and if mechanical power had operated with such energy and to such an extent all our knowledge of the structure of the earth and of the existence of its inhabitants declares rather a quiet uninterrupted and continually progressive advancement in its formation and development in
