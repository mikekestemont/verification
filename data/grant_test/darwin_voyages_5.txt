surface of the muddy sand when touched or pulled they drew themselves in suddenly and with force so as nearly or quite to disappear by this action the highly elastic axis must be bent at the lower extremity where it is naturally slightly curved and i imagine it is by this elasticity that the zoophyte is enabled to rise again through the mud each polypus though closely united to its brethren has a distinct mouth body and tentacula of these polypi in a large specimen there must be many thousands yet we see that they act by one movement that they have one central axis connected with a system of obscure circulation and that the ova are produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals well may one be allowed to ask what is an individual i will add only one other observation on this zoophyte the cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter which examined under a microscope presented an extraordinary appearance the mass consisted of rounded semitransparent irregular grains aggregated together into particles of various sizes all such particles and the separate grains possessed the power of rapid movement generally revolving around different axes but sometimes progressive the movement was visible with a very weak power but with the highest its cause could not be perceived it was very different from the circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag containing the thin extremity of the axis on other occasions when dissecting small marine animals beneath the microscope i have seen particles of pulpy matter some of large size immediately they were disengaged commence revolving i have imagined i know not with how much truth that this granulopulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova certainly in this zoophyte such appeared to be the case during my stay at bahia blanca while waiting for the beagle the place was in a constant state of excitement from rumours of wars and victories between the troops of rosas and the wild indians one day an account came that a small party forming one of the postas on the line to buenos ayres had been found all murdered the next day three hundred men arrived from the colorado under the command of commandant miranda a large portion of these men were indians mansos or tame belonging to the tribe of the cacique bernantio they passed the night here and it was impossible to conceive any thing more wild and savage than the scene of their bivouac some drank till they were intoxicated others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle slaughtered for their suppers and then being sick from drunkenness they cast it up again and were besmeared with filth and gore in the morning they started for the scene of the murder with orders to follow the rastro or track even if it led them to chile we subsequently heard that the wild indians had escaped into the great pampas and from some cause the track had been missed one glance at the rastro tells these people a whole history supposing they examine the track of a thousand horses they will soon guess by seeing how many have cantered the number of men by the depth of the other impressions whether any horses were loaded with cargoes by the irregularity of the footsteps how far tired by the manner in which the food has been cooked whether the pursued travelled in haste by the general appearance how long it has been since they passed they consider a rastro of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be hunted out we also heard that miranda struck from the west end of the sierra ventana in a direct line to the island of cholechel situated seventy leagues up the rio negro this is a distance of between two and three hundred miles through a country completely unknown what other troops in the world are so independent with the sun for their guide mares flesh for food their saddlecloths for bedsas long as there is a little water these men would penetrate to the lands end a few days afterwards i saw another troop of these bandittilike soldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of indians at the small salinas who had been betrayed by a prisoner cacique the spaniard who brought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man he gave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present some indians who had been taken prisoners gave information of a tribe living north of the colorado two hundred soldiers were sent and they first discovered the indians by a cloud of dust from their horses feet as they chanced to be travelling the country was mountainous and wild and it must have been far in the interior for the cordillera was in sight the indians men women and children were about one hundred and ten in number and they were nearly all taken or killed for the soldiers sabre every man the indians are now so terrified that they offer no resistance in a body but each flies neglecting even his wife and children but when overtaken like wild animals they fight against any number to the last moment one dying indian seized with his teeth the thumb of his adversary and allowed his own eye to be forced out sooner than relinquish his hold another who was wounded feigned death keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal blow my informer said when he was pursuing an indian the man cried out for mercy at the same time that he was covertly loosing the bolas from his waist meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his pursuer i however struck him with my sabre to the ground and then got off my horse and cut his throat with my knife this is a dark picture but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact that all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold blood when i exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman he answered why what can be done they breed so every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war because it is against barbarians who would believe in this age in a christian civilized country that such atrocities were committed the children of the indians are saved to be sold or given away as servants or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can deceive them but i believe in this respect there is little to complain of in the battle four men ran away together they were pursued and one was killed but the other three were taken alive they turned out to be messengers or ambassadors from a large body of indians united in the common cause of defence near the cordillera the tribe to which they had been sent was on the point of holding a grand council the feast of mares flesh was ready and the dance prepared in the morning the ambassadors were to have returned to the cordillera they were remarkably fine men very fair above six feet high and all under thirty years of age the three survivors of course possessed very valuable information and to extort this they were placed in a line the two first being questioned answered no se i do not know and were one after the other shot the third also said no se adding fire i am a man and can die not one syllable would they breathe to injure the united cause of their country the conduct of the cacique was very different he saved his life by betraying the intended plan of warfare and the point of union in the andes it was believed that there were already six or seven hundred indians together and that in summer their numbers would be doubled ambassadors were to have been sent to the indians at the small salinas near bahia blanca whom i mentioned that a cacique this same man had betrayed the communication therefore extends from the cordillera to the east coast general rosass plan is to kill all stragglers and having driven the remainder to a common point in the summer with the assistance of the chilenos to attack them in a body this operation is to be repeated for three successive years i imagine the summer is chosen as the time for the main attack because the plains are then without water and the indians can only travel in particular directions the escape of the indians to the south of the rio negro where in such a vast unknown country they would be safe is prevented by a treaty with the tehuelches to this effectthat rosas pays them so much to slaughter every indian who passes to the south of the river but if they fail in so doing they themselves are to be exterminated the war is waged chiefly against the indians near the cordillera for many of the tribes on this eastern side are fighting with rosas the general however like lord chesterfield thinking that his friends may in a future day become his enemies always places them in the front ranks so that their numbers may be thinned since leaving south america we have heard that this war of extermination completely failed among the captive girls taken in the same engagement there were two very pretty spanish ones who had been carried away by the indians when young and could now only speak the indian tongue from their account they must have come from salta a distance in a straight line of nearly one thousand miles this gives one a grand idea of the immense territory over which the indians roam yet great as it is i think there will not in another halfcentury be a wild indian northward of the rio negro the warfare is too bloody to last the christians killing every indian and the indians doing the same by the christians it is melancholy to trace how the indians have given way before the spanish invaders schirdel says that in when buenos ayres was founded there were villages containing two and three thousand inhabitants even in falconers time the indians made inroads as far as lucan areco and arrecife but now they are driven beyond the salado not only have whole tribes been wholly exterminated but the remaining indians have become more barbarous instead of living in large villages and being employed in the arts of fishing as well as of the chase they now wander about the open plains without home or fixed occupation i heard also some account of an engagement which took place a few weeks previously to the one mentioned at cholechel this is a very important station on account of being a pass for horses and it was in consequence for some time the headquarters of a division of the army when the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of indians of whom they killed twenty or thirty the cacique escaped in a manner which astonished every one the chief indians always have one or two picked horses which they keep ready for any urgent occasion on one of these an old white horse the cacique sprung taking with him his little son the horse had neither saddle nor bridle to avoid the shots the indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation namely with an arm round the horses neck and one leg only on its back thus hanging on one side he was seen patting the horses head and talking to him the pursuers urged every effort in the chase the commandant three times changed his horse but all in vain the old indian father and his son escaped and were free what a fine picture one can form in ones mindthe naked bronzelike figure of the old man with his little boy riding like a mazeppa on the white horse thus leaving far behind him the host of his pursuers i saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint which i immediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow he told me it was found near the island of cholechel and that they are frequently picked up there it was between two and three inches long and therefore twice as large as those now used in tierra del fuego it was made of opake creamcoloured flint but the point and barbs had been intentionally broken off it is well known that no pampas indians now use bows and arrows i believe a small tribe in banda oriental must be excepted but they are widely separated from the pampas indians and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest and live on foot it appears therefore that these arrowheads are antiquarian relics of the indians before the great change in habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into south

hailstorm natural enclosures in sierra tapalguen flesh of puma meat diet guardia del monte effects of cattle on the vegetation cardoon buenos ayres corral where animals are slaughtered bahia blanca to buenos ayres september thhaving with some difficulty hired a gaucho to accompany me on my ride to buenos ayres we started early in the morning the distance is about four hundred miles and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited country ascending a few hundred feet from the basin of green turf on which bahia blanca stands we entered on a wide desolate plain it consists of a crumbling argillaceocalcareous rock which from the dry nature of the climate supports only scattered tufts of withered grass without a single bush or tree to break the monotonous uniformity the weather was fine but the atmosphere remarkably hazy i thought the appearance foreboded a gale but the gauchos said it was owing to the plain at some great distance in the interior being on fire after a long gallop having changed horses twice we reached the rio sauce it is a deep rapid little stream but not above twentyfive feet wide the second posta on the road to buenos ayres stands on its banks a little above there is a pass for horses where the water does not reach to the horses belly but from that point in its course to the sea it is quite impassable and hence makes a most useful barrier against the indians insignificant as this stream is the jesuit falconer whose information is generally so very correct figures it as a considerable river rising at the foot of the cordillera with respect to its source i do not doubt this is the case for the gauchos assured me that in the middle of the dry summer this stream at the same time with the colorado has periodical floods which can only originate in the snow melting on the andes it is extremely improbable that a stream so small as the sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the continent and indeed if it were the residue of a large river its waters as in other ascertained cases would be saline during the winter we must look to the springs round the sierra ventana as the source of its pure and limpid stream i suspect the plains of patagonia like those of australia are traversed by many watercourses which only perform their proper parts at certain periods probably this is the case with the water which flows into the head of port desire and likewise with the rio chupat on the banks of which masses of highly cellular scoriæ were found by the officers employed in the survey as it was early in the afternoon when we arrived we took fresh horses and a soldier for a guide and started for the sierra de la ventana this mountain is visible from the anchorage at bahia blanca and capt fitzroy calculates its height to be feetan altitude very remarkable on this eastern side of the continent i am not aware that any foreigner previous to my visit had ascended this mountain and indeed very few of the soldiers at bahia blanca knew any thing about it hence we heard of beds of coal of gold and silver of caves and of forests all of which inflamed my curiosity only to disappoint it the distance from the posta was about six leagues over a level plain of the same character as before the ride was however interesting as the mountain began to show its true form when we reached the foot of the main ridge we had much difficulty in finding any water and we thought we should have been obliged to have passed the night without any at last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain for at the distance even of a few hundred yards the streamlets were buried and entirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus i do not think nature ever made a more solitary desolate pile of rockit well deserves its name of hurtado or separated the mountain is steep extremely rugged and broken and so entirely destitute of trees and even bushes that we actually could not find a skewer to stretch out our meat over the fire made of thistle stalks the strange aspect of this mountain is contrasted by the sealike plain which not only abuts against its steep sides but likewise separates the parallel ranges the uniformity of the colouring gives also an extreme quietness to the viewthe whitish gray of the quartz rock and the light brown of the withered grass of the plain being unrelieved by any brighter tint from custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and bold mountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments here nature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is changed into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity under these circumstances i was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any pebbles could be found on the shores of bahia blanca and near the settlement there were some of quartz which certainly must have come from this source the distance is fortyfive miles the dew which in the early part of the night wetted the saddlecloths under which we slept was in the morning frozen from the sharpness of the cold i supposed we were already at a considerable elevation although to the eye the plain had appeared horizontal in the morning th september the guide told me to ascend the nearest ridge which he thought would lead me to the four peaks that crown the summit the climbing up such rough rocks was very fatiguing the sides were so indented that what was gained in one five minutes was often lost in the next at last when i reached the ridge my disappointment was extreme in finding a precipitous valley as deep as the plain which cut the chain transversely in two and separated me from the four points this valley is very narrow but flatbottomed and it forms a fine horsepass for the indians as it connects the plains on the northern and southern sides of the range having descended and while crossing it i saw two horses grazing i immediately hid myself in the long grass and began to reconnoitre but as i could see no signs of indians i proceeded cautiously on my second ascent it was late in the day and this part of the mountain like the other was steep and rugged i was on the top of the second peak by two oclock but got there with extreme difficulty every twenty yards i had the cramp in the upper part of both thighs so that i was afraid i should not have been able to have descended it was also necessary to return by another road as it was out of the question to pass over the saddleback i was therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks their altitude was but little greater and every purpose of geology had been answered so that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion i presume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of muscular action from that of hard riding to that of still harder climbing it is a lesson worth remembering as in some cases it might cause much difficulty i have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock and with it a little glossy clayslate is associated at the height of a few hundred feet above the plain patches of conglomerate adhered in several places to the solid rock they resembled in hardness and in the nature of the cement the masses which may be seen daily forming on some coasts i do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner aggregated at a period when the great calcareous formation was depositing beneath the surrounding sea we may believe that the jagged and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves of an open ocean i was on the whole disappointed with this ascent even the view was insignificanta plain like the sea but without its beautiful colour and defined outline the scene however was novel and a little danger like salt to meat gives it a relish that the danger was very little was certain for my two companions made a good firea thing which is never done when it is suspected that indians are near i reached the place of our bivouac by sunset and drinking much maté and smoking several cigaritos soon made up my bed for the night the wind was very strong and cold but i never slept more comfortably september thin the morning having fairly scudded before the gale we arrived by the middle of the day at the sauce posta on the road we saw great numbers of deer and near the mountain a guanaco the plain that abuts against the sierra is traversed by some curious gullies of which one was about twenty feet wide and at least thirty deep we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we could find a pass we staid the night at the posta the conversation as was generally the case being about the indians the sierra ventana was formerly a great place of resort and three or four years ago there was much fighting here my guide had been present when many men were killed the women escaped to the top of the ridge and fought most desperately with big stones many thus saving themselves september thproceeded to the third posta in company with the lieutenant who commanded it the distance is called fifteen leagues but it is only guesswork and is generally overstated the road was uninteresting over a dry grassy plain and on our left hand at a greater or less distance there were some low hills a chain of which we crossed close to the posta before our arrival we met a large herd of cattle and horses guarded by fifteen soldiers but we were told many had been lost it is very difficult to drive animals across the plains for if in the night a lion or even a fox approaches nothing can prevent the horses dispersing in every direction and a storm will have the same effect a short time since an officer left buenos ayres with horses and when he arrived at the army he had under twenty soon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust that a party of horsemen were coming towards us when far distant my companions knew them to be indians by their long hair streaming behind their backs the indians generally have a fillet round their heads but never any covering and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces heightens to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance they turned out to be a party of bernantios friendly tribe going to a salina for salt the indians eat much salt their children sucking it like sugar this habit is very different from that of the spanish gauchos who leading the same kind of life eat scarcely any the indians gave us goodhumoured nods as they passed at full gallop driving before them a troop of horses and followed by a train of lanky dogs september th and thi staid at this posta two days waiting for a troop of soldiers which general rosas had the kindness to send to inform me would shortly travel to buenos ayres and he advised me to take the opportunity of such an escort in the morning we rode to some neighbouring hills to view the country and to examine the geology after dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a trial of skill with the bolas two spears were stuck in the ground thirtyfive yards apart but they were struck and entangled only once in four or five times the balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards but with little certainty this however does not apply to a man on horseback for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the arm it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance of eighty yards in the middle of the day two men had arrived who brought a parcel from the next posta to be forwarded to the general so that besides these two our party consisted of myself and guide the lieutenant and his four soldiers the latter were strange beings the first a fine young negro the second half indian and negro and the two others nondescripts namely an old chilian miner the colour of mahogany and another partly a mulatto but two such mongrels with such detestable expressions i never saw before at night when they were sitting round the fire and playing at cards i retired to view such a salvator rosa scene they were seated under a low cliff so that i could look down upon them around the party were lying dogs arms remnants of deer and ostriches and their long spears were stuck in the turf further in the dark background their horses were tied up ready for any sudden danger if the stillness of the desolate plain was broken by one of the dogs barking a soldier leaving the fire would place his head close to the ground and thus slowly scan the horizon even if the noisy terutero uttered its scream there would be a pause in the conversation and every head for a moment a little inclined what a life of misery these men appear to us to lead they were at least ten leagues from the sauce posta and since the murder committed by the indians twenty from another the indians are supposed to have made their attack in the middle of the night for very early in the morning after the murder they were luckily seen approaching this posta the whole party however escaped together with the troop of horses each one taking a line for himself and driving with him as many animals as he was able to manage the little hovel built of thistlestalks in which they slept neither kept out the wind or rain indeed in the latter case the only effect the roof had was to condense it into larger drops they had nothing to eat excepting what they could catch such as ostriches deer armadilloes c and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small plant somewhat resembling an aloe the sole luxury which these men enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars and sucking maté i used to think the carrion vulture mans constant attendant on these dreary plains while seated on some little eminence seemed by its very patience to say ah when the indians come we shall have a feast in the morning we all sallied forth to hunt and although we had not much success there were some animated chases soon after starting the party separated and so arranged their plans that at a certain time of the day in guessing which they show much skill they should all meet from different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground and thus drive together the wild animals one day i went out hunting at bahia blanca but the men there merely rode in a crescent each being about a quarter of a mile apart from the other a fine male ostrich being turned by the headmost riders tried to escape on one side the gauchos pursued at a reckless pace twisting their horses about with the most admirable command and each man whirling the balls round his head at length the foremost threw them revolving through the air in an instant the ostrich rolled over and over its legs fairly lashed together by the thong the plains abound with three kinds of partridge two of which are as large as hen pheasants their destroyer a small and pretty fox was also singularly numerous in the course of the day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty they were generally near their earths but the dogs killed one when we returned to the posta we found two of the party returned who had been hunting by themselves they had killed a puma and had found an ostrichs nest with twentyseven eggs in it each of these is said to equal in weight eleven hens eggs so that we obtained from this one nest as much food as hens eggs would have yielded september thas the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to return and we should together make a party of five and all armed i determined not to wait for the expected troops after galloping some leagues we came to a low swampy country which extends for nearly eighty miles to the northward as far as the sierra tapalguen in some parts there were fine damp plains covered with grass while others had a soft black and peaty soil there were also many extensive but shallow lakes and large beds of reeds the country on the whole resembled the better parts of the cambridgeshire fens at night we had some difficulty in finding amidst the swamps a dry place for our bivouac september throse very early in the morning and shortly after passed the posta where the indians had murdered the five soldiers the officer had eighteen chuzo wounds in his body by the middle of the day after a hard gallop we reached the fifth posta on account of some difficulty in procuring horses we staid there the night as this point was the most exposed on the whole line twentyone soldiers were stationed there at sunset they returned from hunting bringing with them seven deer three ostriches and many armadilloes and partridges when riding through the country it is a common practice to set fire to the plain and hence at night as on this occasion the horizon was illuminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations this is done partly for the sake of puzzling any stray indians but chiefly for improving the pasture in grassy plains unoccupied by the larger ruminating quadrupeds it seems necessary to remove by fire the superfluous vegetation so as to render serviceable the new years growth the rancho at this place did not boast even of a roof but merely consisted of a ring of thistlestalks to break the force of the wind it was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake swarming with wild fowl among which the blacknecked swan was conspicuous the kind of plover which appears is if mounted on stilts himantopus melanura is here common in flocks of considerable size it has been wrongfully accused of inelegance when wading about in shallow water which is its favourite resort its gait is far from awkward these birds in a flock utter a noise that singularly resembles the cry of a pack of small dogs in full chase waking in the night i have more than once been for a moment startled at the distant sound the terutero vanellus cayanensis is another bird which often disturbs the stillness of the night in appearance and habits it resembles in many respects our peewits its wings however are armed with sharp spurs like those on the legs of the common cock as our peewit takes its name from the sound of its voice so does the terutero while riding over the grassy plains one is constantly pursued by these birds which appear to hate mankind and i am sure deserve to be hated for their neverceasing unvaried harsh screams to the sportsman they are most annoying by telling every other bird and animal of his approach to the traveller in the country they may possibly as molina says do good by warning him of the midnight robber during the breeding season they attempt like our peewits by feigning to be wounded to draw away from their nests dogs and other enemies the eggs of this bird are esteemed a great delicacy september thto the seventh posta at the foot of the sierra tapalguen the country was quite level with a coarse herbage and a soft peaty soil the hovel was there remarkably neat the posts and rafters being made of about a dozen dry thistlestalks bound together with thongs of hide and by the aid of these ioniclike columns the roof and sides were thatched with reeds we were here told a fact which i would not have credited if i had not had partly ocular proof of it namely that during the previous night hail as large as small apples and extremely hard had fallen with such violence as to kill the greater number of the wild animals one of the men had already found thirteen deer cervus campestris lying dead and i saw their fresh hides another of the party a few minutes after my arrival brought in seven more now i well know that one man without dogs would hardly have killed seven deer in a week the men believed they had seen about fifteen dead ostriches part of one of which we had for dinner and they said that several were running about evidently blind in one eye numbers of smaller birds as ducks hawks and partridges were killed i saw one of the latter with a black mark on its back as if it had been struck with a pavingstone a fence of thistlestalks round the hovel was nearly broken down and my informer putting his head out to see what was the matter received a severe cut and now wore a bandage the storm was said to have been of limited extent we certainly saw from our last nights bivouac a dense cloud and lightning in this direction it is marvellous how such strong animals as deer could thus have been killed but i have no doubt from the evidence i have given that the story is not in the least exaggerated i am glad however to have its credibility supported by the jesuit drobrizhoffer who speaking of a country much to the northward says hail fell of an enormous size and killed vast numbers of cattle the indians hence called the place lalegraicavalca meaning the little white things having finished our dinner of hailstricken meat we crossed the sierra tapalguen a low range of hills a few hundred feet in height which commences at cape corrientes the rock in this part is pure quartz further eastward i understand it is granitic the hills are of a remarkable form they consist of flat patches of tableland surrounded by low but perpendicular cliffs like the outliers of a sedimentary deposit the hill which i ascended was very small not above a couple of hundred yards in diameter but i saw others larger one which goes by the name of the corral is said to be two or three miles in diameter and encompassed on all sides by perpendicular cliffs between thirty and forty feet high excepting at one spot where the entrance lies falconer gives a curious account of the indians driving within it troops of wild horses and then by guarding the entrance keeping them secure i have never heard of any other instance of tableland in a formation of quartz and which in the hill i examined had neither cleavage or stratification i was told that the rock of the corral was white and would strike fire we did not reach the posta on the rio tapalguen till after it was dark at supper from something which was said i was suddenly struck with horror at thinking that i was eating one of the favourite dishes of the country namely a halfformed calf long before its proper time of birth it turned out to be puma the meat is very white and remarkably like veal in taste dr shaw was laughed at for stating that the flesh of the lion is in great esteem having no small affinity with veal both in colour taste and flavour such certainly is the case with the puma the gauchos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar is good eating but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent september thwe followed the course of the rio tapalguen through a very fertile country to the ninth posta tapalguen itself or the town of tapalguen if it may be so called consists of a perfectly level plain studded over as far as the eye can reach with the toldos or ovenshaped huts of the indians the families of the friendly indians who were fighting on the side of rosas resided here we met and passed many young indian women riding by two or three together on the same horse they as well as many of the young men were strikingly handsometheir fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health besides the toldos there were three ranchos one inhabited by the commandant and the two others by spaniards with small shops we were here able to buy some biscuit i had now been several days without tasting any thing besides meat i did not at all dislike this new regimen but i felt as if it would only have agreed with very hard exercise i have heard that patients in england when desired to confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet even with the hope of life before their eyes have hardly been able to endure it yet the gaucho in the pampas for months together touches nothing but beef but they eat i observe a very large proportion of fat which is of a less animalized nature and they particularly dislike dry meat such as that of the agouti it is perhaps from this regimen that the gauchos like other carnivorous animals can abstain long from food i was told that at tandeel some troops voluntarily pursued a party of indians for three days without eating or drinking we saw in the shops many articles such as horsecloths belts and garters woven by the indian women the patterns were very pretty and the colours brilliant the workmanship of the garters was so good that an english merchant at buenos ayres maintained they must have been manufactured in england till he found the tassels had been fastened by split sinew september thwe had a very long ride this day at the twelfth posta which is seven leagues south of rio salado we came to the first estancia with cattle and white women afterwards we had to ride for many miles through a country flooded with water above our horses knees by crossing the stirrups and riding arablike with our legs bent up we contrived to keep tolerably dry it was nearly dark when we arrived at the salado the stream was deep and about forty yards wide in summer however its bed becomes almost dry and the little remaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea we slept at one of the great estancias of general rosas it was fortified and of such an extent that arriving in the dark i thought it was a town and fortress in the morning we saw immense herds of cattle as well we might the general here having seventyfour square leagues of land formerly nearly three hundred men were employed about this estate and they defied all the attacks of the indians september thpassed the guardia del monte this is a nice scattered little town with many gardens full of peach and quince trees the plain here looked like that around buenos ayres the turf being short and bright green with beds of clover and thistles and with bizcacha holes i was very much struck with the marked change in the aspect of the country after having crossed the salado from a coarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure i at first attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil but the inhabitants assured me that in this part as well as in banda oriental where there was as great a difference between the country around monte video and the thinlyinhabited savannahs of colonia that the whole was to be attributed to the manuring and grazing of the cattle i am not botanist enough to say whether the change is owing to the introduction of new species to the altered growth of the same or to a difference in their proportional numbers azara has also observed with astonishment this change he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of plants not occurring in the neighbourhood on the borders of any track that leads to a newlyconstructed hovel in another part he says ces chevaux sauvages ont la manie de préférer les chemins et le bord des routes pour déposer leurs excrémens dont on trouve des monceaux dans ces endroits does this not partly explain the circumstance we thus have lines of richlymanured land serving as channels of communication across wide districts near the guardia we find the southern limit of two european plants now become excessively common the fennel in great profusion covers the ditch banks in the neighbourhood of buenos ayres monte video and other towns but the cardoon cynara cardunculus has a far wider range it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the cordillera across the continent i saw it in unfrequented spots in chile entre rios and banda oriental in the latter country alone very many probably several hundred square miles are covered by one mass of these prickly plants and are impenetrable by man or beast over the undulating plains where these great beds occur nothing else can live before their introduction however i apprehend the surface supported as in other parts a rank herbage i doubt whether any case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over the aborigines as i have already said i nowhere saw the cardoon south of the salado but it is probable that in proportion as that country becomes inhabited the cardoon will extend its limits the case is different with the giant thistle with variegated leaves of the pampas for i met with it in the valley of the sauce according to the principles so well laid down by mr lyell few countries have undergone more remarkable changes since the year when the first colonist of la plata landed with seventytwo horses the countless herds of horses cattle and sheep not only have altered the whole aspect of the vegetation but they have almost banished the guanaco deer and ostrich numberless other changes must likewise have taken place the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the peccari packs of wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the less frequented streams and the common cat altered into a large and fierce animal inhabits rocky hills i have alluded to the invasion of the cardoon in a like manner the islands near the mouth of the parana are thickly clothed with peaches and orangetrees springing from seeds carried there by the waters of the river while changing horses at the guardia several people questioned us much about the armyi never saw any thing like the enthusiasm for rosas and for the success of the most just of all wars because against barbarians this expression it must be confessed is very natural for till lately neither man woman nor horse was safe from the attacks of the indians we had a long days ride over the same rich green plain abounding with various flocks and with here and there a solitary estancia and its one ombu tree in the evening it rained heavily on arriving at a posthouse we were told by the owner that if we had not a regular passport we must pass on for there were so many robbers he would trust no one when he read however my passport which began with el naturalista don carlos c his respect and civility were as unbounded as his suspicions had been before what a naturalist may be neither he nor his countrymen i suspect had any idea but probably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause september thwe arrived by the middle of the day at buenos ayres the outskirts of the city looked quite pretty with the agave hedges and groves of olive peach and willow trees all just throwing out their fresh green leaves i rode to the house of mr lumb an english merchant to whose kindness and hospitality during my stay in the country i was greatly indebted the city of buenos ayres is large and i should think one of the most regular in the world every street is at right angles to the one it crosses and the parallel ones being equidistant the houses are collected into solid squares of equal dimensions which are called quadras on the other hand the houses themselves are hollow squares all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard they are generally only one story high with flat roofs which are fitted with seats and are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer in the centre of the town is the plaza where the public offices fortress cathedral c stand here also the old viceroys before the revolution had their palaces the general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable architectural beauty although none individually can boast of any the great corral where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply food to this beefeating population is one of the spectacles best worth seeing the strength of the horse as compared to that of the bullock is quite astonishing a man on horseback having thrown his lazo round the horns of a beast can drag it any where he chooses the animal having ploughed up the ground with outstretched legs in vain efforts to resist the force generally dashes at full speed to one side but the horse immediately turning to receive the shock stands so firmly that the bullock is almost thrown down and one would think would certainly have its neck dislocated the struggle is not however one of fair strength the horses girth being matched against the bullocks extended neck in a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse if caught with the lazo just behind the ears when the bullock has been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered the matador with great caution cuts the hamstrings then is given the death bellow a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any i know i have often distinguished it from a long distance and have always known that the struggle was then drawing to a close the whole sight is horrible and revolting the ground is almost made of bones and the horses and riders are drenched with gore chapter vii excursion to st fe thistle beds habits and range of bizcacha little owl

habits of jaguar scissorbeak kingfisher parrot and scissortail revolution buenos ayres state of government buenos ayres to st fe september thin the evening i set out on an excursion to st fe which is situated nearly three hundred english miles from buenos ayres on the banks of the parana the roads in the neighbourhood of the city after the rainy weather were extraordinarily bad i should never have thought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along as it was they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour and a man was kept ahead to survey the best line for making the attempt the bullocks were terribly jaded it is a great mistake to suppose that with improved roads and an accelerated velocity of travelling the sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion we passed a train of waggons and a troop of beasts on their road to mendoza the distance is about geographical miles and the journey is generally performed in fifty days these waggons are very long narrow and thatched with reeds they have only two wheels the diameter of which in some cases is even ten feet each is drawn by six bullocks which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long this is suspended from within the roof for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is kept and for the intermediate pair a point projects at right angles from the middle of the long one the whole apparatus looked like some implement of war september thwe passed the small town of luxan where there is a wooden bridge over the rivera most unusual convenience in this country we passed also areco the plains appeared level but were not so in fact for in various places the horizon was distant the estancias are here wide apart for there is little good pasture owing to the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover or of the great thistle the latter well known from the animated description given by sir f head were at this time of the year twothirds grown in some parts they were as high as the horses back but in others they had not yet sprung up and the ground was bare and dusty as on a turnpike road the clumps were of the most brilliant green and they made a pleasing miniaturelikeness of broken forest land when the thistles are fully grown the great beds are impenetrable except by a few tracks as intricate as those in a labyrinth these are only known to the robbers who at this season inhabit them and sally forth at night to rob and cut throats with impunity upon asking at a house whether robbers were numerous i was answered the thistles are not up yetthe meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious there is little interest in passing over these tracts for they are inhabited by few animals or birds excepting the bizcacha and its friend the little owl the bizcacha is well known to form a prominent feature in the zoology of the pampas it is found as far south as the rio negro in lat but not beyond it cannot like the agouti subsist on the gravelly and desert plains of patagonia but prefers a clayey or sandy soil which produces a different and more abundant vegetation near mendoza at the foot of the cordillera it occurs in close neighbourhood with the allied alpine species it is a very curious circumstance in its geographical distribution that it has never been seen fortunately for the inhabitants in banda oriental to the eastward of the river uruguay yet in that province there are plains which appear admirably adapted to its habits that river has formed an insuperable obstacle to its migration although the broader barrier of the parana has been passed and the bizcacha is common in entre rios the province between the two rivers directly on the opposite shore of the uruguay near buenos ayres these animals are exceedingly common their most favourite resort appears to be those parts of the plain which during one half the year are covered with giant thistles to the exclusion of other plants the gauchos affirm that it lives on roots which from the great strength of its gnawing teeth and the kind of localities frequented by it seems probable as in the case of the rabbit a few holes are commonly placed together in the evening the bizcachas come out in numbers and there quietly sit on their haunches they are at such times very tame and a man on horseback passing by seems only to present an object for their grave contemplation they do not wander far from their burrows they run very awkwardly and when hurrying out of danger from their elevated tails and short front legs much resemble great rats their flesh when cooked is very white and good but it is seldom used the bizcacha has one very singular habit namely dragging every hard object to the mouth of its burrow around each group of holes many bones of cattle stones thistlestalks hard lumps of earth dry dung c are collected into a scattered heap which frequently amounts to as much as a wheelbarrow would contain i was credibly informed that a gentleman when riding on a dark night dropped his watch he returned in the morning and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha hole on the line of road as he expected soon found it this habit of picking up whatever may be lying on the ground any where near its habitation must cost much trouble for what purpose it is done i am quite unable to form even the most remote conjecture it cannot be for defence because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the burrow which enters the ground at a very small inclination no doubt there must exist some good reason but the inhabitants of the country are quite ignorant respecting it the little owl noctua cunicularia which has been so often mentioned on the plains of buenos ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the bizcacha but in banda oriental it is its own workman during the open day but more especially in the evening these birds may be seen in every direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their burrows if disturbed they either enter the hole or uttering a shrill harsh cry move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short distance and then turning round steadily gaze at their pursuer occasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting i found in the stomachs of two which i opened the remains of mice and i one day saw a small snake killed and carried away it is said these latter animals are their common prey during the daytime i may here mention as showing on what various kinds of food owls subsist that a species that was killed among the islets of the chonos archipelago had its stomach full of goodsized crabs in the evening we crossed the rio arrecife on a simple raft made of barrels lashed together and slept at the posthouse on the other side i this day paid horse hire for thirtyone leagues and although the sun was glaring hot i was but very little fatigued when captain head talks of riding fifty leagues a day i do not imagine the distance is equal to english miles at all events the thirtyone leagues was only miles in a straight line and in an open country i should think four additional miles for turnings would be a sufficient allowance th and thwe continued to ride over plains of the same character at san nicholas i first saw the noble river of the parana at the foot of the cliff on which the town stands some large vessels were at anchor before arriving at rozario we crossed the saladillo a stream of fine clear running water but too saline to drink rozario is a large town built on a dead level plain which forms a cliff about sixty feet high over the parana the river here is very broad with many islands which are low and wooded as is also the coast of the opposite shore the view would resemble that of a great lake if it were not for the linearshaped islets which alone give the idea of running water the cliffs are the most picturesque part sometimes they are absolutely perpendicular and of a red colour at other times in large broken masses covered with cacti and mimosatrees the real grandeur however of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how important a means of communication and commerce it forms between one nation and another to what a distance it travels and from how vast a territory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your feet for many leagues north and south of san nicholas and rozario the country is really level scarcely any thing which travellers have written about its extreme flatness can be considered as exaggeration yet i could never find a spot where by slowly turning round objects were not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others and this manifestly proves inequality in the plain at sea a persons eye being six feet above the surface of the water his horizon is two miles and fourfifths distant in like manner the more level the plain the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow limits and this in my opinion entirely destroys that grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed october stwe started by moonlight and arrived at the rio tercero by sunrise this river is also called the saladillo and it deserves the name for the water is brackish i staid here the greater part of the day searching for fossil bones falconer mentions having seen in the bed of this river great bones and the case of a giant armadillo by good fortune i discovered a tooth embedded in a layer of rock marl which was afterwards found exactly to fit the socket in the head of a strange animal the toxodon which will presently be mentioned hearing also of the remains of one of the old giants which a man told me he had seen on the banks of the parana i procured a canoe and proceeded to the place two groups of immense bones projected in bold relief from the perpendicular cliff they were however so completely decayed that i could only bring away small fragments of one of the great molarteeth but these were sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a species of mastodon the men who took me in the canoe said they had long known of them and had often wondered how they had got there the necessity of a theory being felt they came to the conclusion that like the bizcacha the mastodon formerly was a burrowing animal in the evening
