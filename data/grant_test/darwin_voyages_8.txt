mass of shingle to be collected by the action of innumerable torrents and the swell of an open ocean at the submarine basis of the andes prior to the elevation of the plains of patagonia if such a mass should then be lifted up and left exposed during one of the periods of subterranean repose a certain breadth for instance a mile would be washed down and spread out over the bottom of the invading waters that the sea near the coast can carry out pebbles we may feel sure from the circumstance of their gradual decrease in size according to the distance from the coastline if this part of the sea should now be elevated we should have a bed of gravel but it would be of less thickness than in the first mass both because it is spread over a larger area and because it has been much reduced by attrition this process being repeated we might carry beds of gravel always decreasing in thickness as happens in patagonia to a considerable distance from the line of parent rock for instance on the banks of the st cruz at the distance of one hundred miles above the mouth of the river the bed of gravel is feet thick whereas near the coast it seldom exceeds or feet the thickness being thus reduced to nearly oneeighth i have already stated that the gravel is separated from the fossiliferous strata by some white beds of a friable substance singularly resembling chalk but which cannot be compared as far as i am aware with any formation in europe with respect to its origin i may observe that the wellrounded pebbles all consist of various felspathic porphyries and that from their prolonged attrition during the successive remodellings of the whole mass much sediment must have been produced i have already remarked that the white earthy matter more closely resembles decomposed felspar than any other substance if such is its origin it would always from its lightness be carried further to seaward than the pebbles but as the land was elevated the beds would be brought nearer the coastline and so become covered by the fresh masses of gravel which were travelling outwards when these white beds were themselves elevated they would hold a position intermediate between the gravel and the common foundation or the fossiliferous strata to explain my meaning more clearly let us suppose the bottom of the present sea covered to a certain distance from the coastline with pebbles gradually decreasing in size and beyond it by the white sediment let the land rise so that the beachline by the fall of the water may be carried outwards then likewise the gravel by the same agency as before will be transported so much further from the coast and will cover the white sediment and these beds again will invade the more distant parts of the bottom of the sea by this outward progress the order of superposition must always be gravel white sediment and the fossiliferous strata such is the history of the changes by which the present condition of patagonia has i believe been determined these changes all result from the assumption of a steady but very gradual elevation extending over a wide area and interrupted at long intervals by periods of repose but we must now return to port st julian on the south side of the harbour a cliff of about ninety feet in height intersects a plain constituted of the formations above described and its surface is strewed over with recent marine shells the gravel however differently from that in every other locality is covered by a very irregular and thin bed of a reddish loam containing a few small calcareous concretions the matter somewhat resembles that of the pampas and probably owes its origin either to a small stream having formerly entered the sea at that spot or to a mudbank similar to those now existing at the head of the harbour in one spot this earthy matter filled up a hollow or gully worn quite through the gravel and in this mass a group of large bones was embedded the animal to which they belonged must have lived as in the case at bahia blanca at a period long subsequent to the existence of the shells now inhabiting the coast we may feel sure of this because the formation of the lower terrace or plain must necessarily have been posterior to those above it and on the surface of the two higher ones seashells of recent species are scattered from the small physical change which the last one hundred feet elevation of the continent could have produced the climate as well as the general condition of patagonia probably was nearly the same at the time when the animal was embedded as it now is this conclusion is moreover supported by the identity of the shells belonging to the two ages then immediately occurred the difficulty how could any large quadruped have subsisted on these wretched deserts in lat i had no idea at the time to what kind of animal these remains belonged the puzzle however was soon solved when mr owen examined them for he considers that they formed part of an animal allied to the guanaco or llama but fully as large as the true camel as all the existing members of the family of camelidæ are inhabitants of the most sterile countries so may we suppose was this extinct kind the structure of the cervical vertebræ the transverse processes not being perforated for the vertebral artery indicates its affinity some other parts however of its structure probably are anomalous the most important result of this discovery is the confirmation of the law that existing animals have a close relation in form with extinct species as the guanaco is the characteristic quadruped of patagonia and the vicuna of the snowclad summits of the cordillera so in bygone days this gigantic species of the same family must have been conspicuous on the southern plains we see this same relation of type between the existing and fossil ctenomys between the capybara but less plainly as shown by mr owen and the gigantic toxodon and lastly between the living and extinct edentata at the present day in south america there exist probably nineteen species of this order distributed into several genera while throughout the rest of the world there are but five if then there is a relation between the living and the dead we should expect that the edentata would be numerous in the fossil state i need only reply by enumerating the megatherium and the three or four other great species discovered at bahia blanca the remains of some of which are also abundant over the whole immense territory of la plata i have already pointed out the singular relation between the armadilloes and their great prototypes even in a point apparently of so little importance as their external covering the order of rodents at the present day is most conspicuous in south america on account of the vast number and size of the species and the multitude of individuals according to the same law we should expect to find their representatives in a fossil state mr owen has shown how far the toxodon is thus related and it is moreover not improbable that another large animal has likewise a similar affinity the teeth of the rodent nearly equalling in size those of the capybara which were discovered near bahia blanca must also be remembered the law of the succession of types although subject to some remarkable exceptions must possess the highest interest to every philosophical naturalist and was first clearly observed in regard to australia where fossil remains of a large and extinct species of kangaroo and other marsupial animals were discovered buried in a cave in america the most marked change among the mammalia has been the loss of several species of mastodon of an elephant and of the horse these pachydermata appear formerly to have had a range over the world like that which deer and antelopes now hold if buffon had known of these gigantic armadilloes llamas great rodents and lost pachydermata he would have said with a greater semblance of truth that the creative force in america had lost its vigour rather than that it had never possessed such powers it is impossible to reflect without the deepest astonishment on the changed state of this continent formerly it must have swarmed with great monsters like the southern parts of africa but now we find only the tapir guanaco armadillo and capybara mere pigmies compared to the antecedent races the greater number if not all of these extinct quadrupeds lived at a very recent period and many of them were contemporaries of the existing molluscs since their loss no very great physical changes can have taken place in the nature of the country what then has exterminated so many living creatures in the pampas the great sepulchre of such remains there are no signs of violence but on the contrary of the most quiet and scarcely sensible changes at bahia blanca i endeavoured to show the probability that the ancient edentata like the present species lived in a dry and sterile country such as now is found in that neighbourhood with respect to the camellike llama of patagonia the same grounds which before knowing more than the size of the remains perplexed me by not allowing any great change of climate now that we can guess the habits of the animal are strangely confirmed what shall we say of the death of the fossil horse did those plains fail in pasture which afterwards were overrun by thousands and tens of thousands of the successors of the fresh stock introduced with the spanish colonist in some countries we may believe that a number of species subsequently introduced by consuming the food of the antecedent races may have caused their extermination but we can scarcely credit that the armadillo has devoured the food of the immense megatherium the capybara of the toxodon or the guanaco of the camellike kind but granting that all such changes have been small yet we are so profoundly ignorant concerning the physiological relations on which the life and even health as shown by epidemics of any existing species depends that we argue with still less safety about either the life or death of any extinct kind one is tempted to believe in such simple relations as variation of climate and food or introduction of enemies or the increased numbers of other species as the cause of the succession of races but it may be asked whether it is probable than any such cause should have been in action during the same epoch over the whole northern hemisphere so as to destroy the elephas primigenus on the shores of spain on the plains of siberia and in northern america and in a like manner the bos urus over a range of scarcely less extent did such changes put a period to the life of mastodon angustidens and of the fossil horse both in europe and on the eastern slope of the cordillera in southern america if they did they must have been changes common to the whole world such as gradual refrigeration whether from modifications of physical geography or from central cooling but on this assumption we have to struggle with the difficulty that these supposed changes although scarcely sufficient to affect molluscous animals either in europe or south america yet destroyed many quadrupeds in regions now characterized by frigid temperate and warm climates these cases of extinction forcibly recal the idea i do not wish to draw any close analogy of certain fruittrees which it has been asserted though grafted on young stems planted in varied situations and fertilized by the richest manures yet at one period have all withered away and perished a fixed and determined length of life has in such cases been given to thousands and thousands of buds or individual germs although produced in long succession among the greater number of animals each individual appears nearly independent of its kind yet all of one kind may be bound together by common laws as well as a certain number of individual buds in the tree or polypi in the zoophyte i will add one other remark we see that whole series of animals which have been created with peculiar kinds of organization are confined to certain areas and we can hardly suppose these structures are only adaptations to peculiarities of climate or country for otherwise animals belonging to a distinct type and introduced by man would not succeed so admirably even to the extermination of the aborigines on such grounds it does not seem a necessary conclusion that the extinction of species more than their creation should exclusively depend on the nature altered by physical changes of their country all that at present can be said with certainty is that as with the individual so with the species the hour of life has run its course and is spent chapter x santa cruz expedition up river indians character of patagonia basaltic platform immense streams of lava nontransport of blocks by river excavation of valley condor range and habits cordillera erratic boulders of great size indian relics return to the ship santa cruzpatagonia april ththe beagle anchored within the mouth of the santa cruz this river is situated about sixty miles south of port st julian during the last voyage captain stokes proceeded thirty miles up but then from the want of provisions was obliged to return excepting what was discovered at that time scarcely any thing was known about this large river captain fitzroy now determined to follow its course as far as time would allow on the th three whaleboats started carrying three weeks provisions and the party consisted of twentyfive soulsa force which would have been sufficient to have defied a host of indians with a strong floodtide and a fine day we made a good run soon drank some of the fresh water and were at night nearly above the tidal influence the river here assumed a size and appearance which even at the highest point we ultimately reached was scarcely diminished it was generally from three to four hundred yards broad and in the middle about seventeen feet deep the rapidity of the current which in its whole course runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour is perhaps its most remarkable feature the water is of a fine blue colour but with a slight milky tinge and not so transparent as at first sight would have been expected it flows over a bed of pebbles like those which compose the beach and surrounding plains although its course is winding it runs through a valley which extends in a direct line to the westward this valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth it is bounded by stepformed terraces which rise in most parts one above the other to the height of five hundred feet and have on the opposite sides a remarkable correspondence april thagainst so strong a current it was of course quite impossible to row or sail consequently the three boats were fastened together head and stern two hands left in each and the rest came on shore to track as the general arrangements made by captain fitzroy were very good for facilitating the work of all and as all had a share of it i will describe the system the party including every one was divided into two spells each of which hauled at the tracking line alternately for an hour and a half the officers of each boat lived with ate the same food and slept in the same tent with their crew so that each boat was quite independent of the others after sunset the first level spot where any bushes were growing was chosen for our nights lodging each of the crew took it in turns to be cook immediately the boat was hauled up the cook made his fire two others pitched the tent the coxswain handed the things out of the boat the rest carried them up to the tents and collected firewood by this order in half an hour every thing was ready for the night a watch of two men and an officer was always kept whose duty it was to look after the boats keep up the fire and guard against indians each in the party had his one hour every night during this day we tracked but a short distance for there were many islets covered by thorny bushes and the channels between them were shallow april thwe passed the islands and set to work our regular days march although it was hard enough carried us on an average only ten miles in a straight line and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether beyond the place where we slept last night the country is completely terra incognita for it was there that captain stokes turned back we saw in the distance a great smoke and found the skeleton of a horse so we knew that indians were in the neighbourhood on the next morning st tracks of a party of horse and marks left by the trailing of the chuzos were observed on the ground it was generally thought they must have reconnoitred us during the night shortly afterwards we came to a spot where from the fresh footsteps of men children and horses it was evident the party had crossed the river april dthe country remained the same and was extremely uninteresting the complete similarity of the productions throughout patagonia is one of its most striking characters the level plains of arid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants and in the valleys the same thornbearing bushes grow every where we see the same birds and insects even the very banks of the river and of the clear streamlets which entered it were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint of green the curse of sterility is on the land and the water flowing over a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse hence the number of waterfowl is very scanty for what is there to support life in the stream of this barren river patagonia poor as she is in some respects can however boast of a greater stock of small rodents than perhaps any other country in the world several species of mice are externally characterized by large thin ears and a very fine fur these little animals swarm amongst the thickets in the valleys where they cannot for months together taste a drop of water they all seem to be cannibals for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my traps than it was devoured by others a small and delicatelyshaped fox which is likewise very abundant probably derives its entire support from these small animals the guanaco is also in his proper district herds of fifty or a hundred were common and as i have said we saw one which must have contained at least five hundred the puma with the condor in its train follows and preys upon these animals the footsteps of the former were to be seen almost every where on the banks of the river and the remains of several guanaco with their necks dislocated and bones broken showed how they had met their death april thlike the navigators of old when approaching an unknown land we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change the drifted trunk of a tree or a boulder of primitive rock was hailed with joy as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the cordillera the top however of a heavy bank of clouds which remained almost constantly in one position was the most promising sign and eventually turned out true at first the clouds were mistaken for the mountains themselves instead of the masses of vapour condensed by their icy summits thwe this day met with a marked change in the geological structure of the plains from the first starting i had carefully examined the gravel in the river and for the two last days had noticed the presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt these gradually increased in number and in size but none equalled in dimensions a mans head this morning however pebbles of the same rock but more compact suddenly became abundant and in the course of half an hour we saw at the distance of five or six miles the angular edge of a great basaltic platform when we arrived at its base we found the stream bubbling among the fallen blocks for the next twentyeight miles the rivercourse was encumbered with these basaltic masses above that limit immense fragments belonging to a primitive formation but derived from the surrounding alluvium were equally numerous in both cases no fragments at all remarkable in size or number had been washed down the stream more than three or four miles below either the parent rock or the mass of alluvium from which they were derived considering the singular rapidity of the great body of water in the st cruz and that no still reaches occur in any part these examples are most striking of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting even moderatelysized fragments the basaltic cliffs are obscurely divided by lines of more cellular or amygdaloidal varieties and the strata appear to the eye perfectly horizontal they overlie the great tertiary deposits and are covered except where denuded in some of the lower terraces by the usual beds of gravel the basalt is clearly nothing more than lava which has flowed beneath the sea but the eruptions must have been on the grandest scale at the point where we first met this formation the mass was about feet in thickness following the rivercourse it imperceptibly rose and became thicker so that at forty miles above the first station it was feet what the thickness may be close to the cordillera i have no means of knowing but the platform there attains an elevation between two and three thousand feet above the level of the sea we must therefore look to the mountains of that great chain for its source and worthy of such a source are streams that have flowed over the bed of an ocean to a distance of one hundred miles a fine section of the basaltic platform is presented by the cliffs on both sides of the valley at the first glance it is evident the strata must at one time have been united what power then has removed along a whole line of country a solid mass of very hard rock which had an average thickness of about three hundred feet and a breadth varying from rather less than two to four miles the river though it has so little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments yet in the lapse of ages might produce an effect by its gradual erosion of which it is difficult to judge the limit but in this case independently of the insignificance of such agency good reasons can be assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an arm of the sea it is needless in this work to detail arguments which chiefly rest on the form and nature of the banks on the manner in which the valley near the foot of the andes expands into a great bay and on the occurrence of a few seashells lying in the bed of the river if i had space i could prove that south america was formerly here cut off by a strait joining the atlantic and pacific oceans like that of magellan but it may yet be asked how has the solid basalt been removed geologists formerly would have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming debacle but in this case such a supposition would have been quite inadmissible because the same steplike terraces that front the patagonian coast sweep up on each side of the valley no possible action of any flood could have thus modelled the land in these two situations and by the formation of such terraces the valley itself has been hollowed out although we know that there are tides which run within the narrows of the strait of magellan at the rate of eight knots an hour yet we must confess it makes the head almost giddy to reflect on the number of years century after century which the tides unaided by a heavy surf must have required to have corroded so vast an area and thickness of solid rock nevertheless we must believe that the strata undermined by the waters of this ancient strait were broken up into huge fragments and there lying scattered on the beach were reduced to smaller blocks then to pebbles and lastly to the most impalpable mud which the tides drifted into the bed either of the eastern or western ocean with the change in the geological structure of the plains the character of the landscape likewise altered while rambling up some of the narrow and rocky defiles i could almost have fancied myself transported back again to the barren valleys of st jago among the basaltic cliffs i found some plants which i had seen nowhere else but others i recognised as being wanderers from tierra del fuego these porous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rainwater and consequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations unite several small springs most rare occurrences in patagonia burst forth and they could be distinguished at a distance by the circumscribed patch of bright green herbage april ththe bed of the river became rather narrower and hence the stream more rapid it here ran at the rate of six knots an hour from this cause and from the many great angular fragments tracking the boats became both dangerous and laborious this day i shot a condor it measured from tip to tip of the wings eight and a half feet and from beak to tail four feet it is a magnificent spectacle to behold several of these great birds seated on the edge of some steep precipice i will here describe all i have observed respecting their habits the condor is known to have a wide geographical range being found on the west coast of south america from the strait of magellan throughout the entire range of the cordillera on the patagonian shore the steep cliff near the mouth of the rio negro in lat was the most northern point where i saw these birds or heard of their existence they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great central line of their habitation in the andes further south among the bold precipices which form the head of port desire they are not uncommon yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the seacoast a line of cliff near the mouth of st cruz is frequented by these birds and about eighty miles up the river where first the sides of the valley were formed by steep basaltic precipices the condor again appeared although in the intermediate space not one had been seen from these and similar facts the presence of this bird seems chiefly to be determined by the occurrence of perpendicular cliffs in patagonia the condors either by pairs or many together both sleep and breed on the same overhanging ledges in chile during the greater part of the year they haunt the lower country near the shores of the pacific and at night several roost in one tree but in the early part of summer they retire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner cordillera there to breed in peace with respect to their propagation i was told by the country people in chile that the condor makes no sort of nest but in the months of november and december lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock on the patagonian coast i could not see any sort of nest among the cliffs where the young ones were standing it is said the young condors cannot fly for an entire year at concepcion on the fifth of march corresponding to our september i saw a young bird which though in size little inferior to an old one was completely covered by down like that of a gosling but of a blackish colour i feel sure this bird could not have used its wings for flight for many months after the period when the young condors can fly and apparently as well as the old birds they yet remain both roosting at night on the same ledge and hunting by day with their parents before however the young bird has the ruff round its neck turned white it may often be seen hunting by itself at the mouth of the st cruz during part of april and may a pair of old birds might be seen every day either perched on a certain ledge or sailing about in company with a single young one which latter though full fledged had not its ruff white i should think especially when recollecting the state in which the concepcion bird was on the previous month that this young condor had not been hatched from an egg of that summer as there were no other young birds it seems probable that the condor only lays once in two years these birds generally live by pairs but among the inland basaltic cliffs of the st cruz i found a spot where scores most usually haunt on coming suddenly to the brow of the precipice it was a fine sight to see between twenty and thirty of these great birds start heavily from their restingplace and wheel away in majestic circles from the quantity of dung on the rocks they must long have frequented this cliff and probably they both roost and breed there having gorged themselves with carrion on the plains below they retire to these favourite ledges to digest their food from these facts the condor must to a certain degree like the gallinazo be considered a gregarious bird in this part of the country they live altogether on the guanacoes which either have died a natural death or as more commonly happens have been killed by the pumas i believe from what i saw in patagonia that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily excursions to any great distance from their regular sleepingplaces the condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height soaring over a certain spot in the most graceful spires and circles on some occasions i am sure that they do this for sport but on others the chileno countrymen tell you that they are watching a dying animal or the puma devouring its prey if the condors glide down and then suddenly all rise together the chileno knows that it is the puma which watching the carcass has sprung out to drive away the robbers besides feeding on carrion the condors will frequently attack young goats and lambs hence the shepherd dogs are trained the moment the enemy passes over to run out and looking upwards to bark violently the chilenos destroy and catch numbers two methods are used one is to place a carcass within an enclosure of sticks on a level piece of ground and when the condors are gorged to gallop up on horseback to the entrance and thus enclose them for when this bird has not space to run it cannot give its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground the second method is to mark the trees in which frequently to the number of five or six they roost together and then at night to climb up and noose them they are such heavy sleepers as i have myself witnessed that this is not a difficult task at valparaiso i have seen a living condor sold for sixpence but the common price is eight or ten shillings one which i saw brought in had been lashed with rope and was much injured yet the moment the line was cut by which its bill was secured although surrounded by people it began ravenously to tear a piece of carrion in a garden at the same place between twenty and thirty were kept alive they were fed only once a week but they appeared in pretty good health the chileno countrymen assert that the condor will live and retain its powers between five and six weeks without eating i cannot answer for the truth of this but it is a cruel experiment which very likely has been tried when an animal is killed in the country it is well known that the condors like other carrion vultures soon gain intelligence of it and congregate in an inexplicable manner in most cases it must not be overlooked that the birds have discovered their prey and have picked the skeleton clean before the flesh is in the least tainted remembering the opinions of m audubon on the little smelling powers of such birds i tried in the abovementioned garden the following experiment the condors were tied each by a rope in a long row at the bottom of a wall having folded up a piece of meat in white paper i walked backwards and forwards carrying it in my hand at the distance of about three yards but no notice whatever was taken i then threw it on the ground within one yard of an old cock bird he looked at it for a moment with attention but then regarded it no more with a stick i pushed it closer and closer until at last he touched it with his beak the paper was then instantly torn off with fury and at the same moment every bird in the long row began struggling and flapping its wings under the same circumstances it would not have been possible to have deceived a dog i may remark that oftentimes when lying down to rest on the open plains and on looking upwards i have seen carrion hawks sailing through the air at a great height where the country is level i do not believe a space of the heavens of more than above the horizon is commonly viewed with any attention by a person either walking or on horseback if such is the case and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three and four thousand feet before it could come within the above range of vision its distance in a straight line from the beholders eye would be rather more than two british miles might it not thus readily be overlooked when an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely valley may he not all the while be watched from above by the sharpsighted bird and will not the manner of its descent proclaim throughout the district to the whole family of carrionfeeders that their prey is at hand when the condors in a flock are wheeling round and round any spot their flight is beautiful except when rising from the ground i do not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings near lima i watched several for nearly half an hour without once taking off my eyes they moved in large curves sweeping in circles descending and ascending without once flapping as they glided close over my head i intently watched from an oblique position the outlines of the separate and terminal feathers of the wing if there had been the least vibratory movement these would have been blended together but they were seen distinct against the blue sky the head and neck were moved frequently and apparently with force and it appeared as if the extended wings formed the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck body and tail acted if the bird wished to descend the wings were for a moment collapsed and then when again expanded with an altered inclination the momentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards with the even and steady movement of a paper kite in the case of any bird soaring its motion must be sufficiently rapid so that the action of the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may counterbalance its gravity the force to keep up the momentum of a body moving in a horizontal plane in that fluid in which there is so little friction cannot be great and this force is all that is wanted the movement of the neck and body of the condor we must suppose is sufficient for this however this may be it is truly wonderful and beautiful to see so great a bird hour after hour without any apparent exertion wheeling and gliding over mountain and river april thfrom some high land we hailed with joy the white summits of the cordillera as they were seen occasionally peeping through their dusky envelope of clouds during the few succeeding days we continued to get on slowly for we found the rivercourse very tortuous and strewed with immense fragments of various ancient slaty rocks and of granite the plain bordering the valley had here attained an elevation of about feet and its character was much altered the wellrounded pebbles of porphyry were in this part mingled with many immense angular fragments of basalt and of the rocks above mentioned the first of these erratic blocks which i noticed was sixtyseven miles distant from the nearest mountain another which had been transported to rather a less distance measured five yards square and projected five feet above the gravel its edges were so angular and its size so great that i at first mistook it for a rock in situ and took out my compass to observe the direction of its cleavage the plains here were not quite so level as those nearer the coast but yet they betrayed little signs of any violent action under these circumstances it would be difficult as it appears to me to explain this phenomenon on any theory excepting through that of transport by ice while the country was under water but this is a subject to which i shall again recur during the two last days we met with signs of horses and with several small articles which had belonged to the indianssuch as parts of a mantle and a bunch of ostrich feathersbut they appeared to have been lying long on the ground between the place where the indians had so lately crossed the river and this neighbourhood though so many miles apart the country appears to be quite unfrequented at first considering the abundance of the guanacoes i was surprised at this but it is explained by the stony nature of the plains which would soon disable an unshod horse from taking part in the chase nevertheless in two places in this very central region i found small heaps of stones which i do not think could have been accidentally thrown together they were placed on points projecting over the edge of the highest lava cliff and they resembled but on a small scale those near port desire may thcaptain fitzroy determined to take the boats no higher the river had a winding course and was very rapid and the appearance of the country offered no temptation to proceed any further every where we met with the same productions and the same dreary landscape we were now one hundred and forty miles distant from the atlantic and about sixty from the nearest arm of the pacific the valley in this upper part expanded into a wide basin bounded on the north and south by the basaltic platforms and fronted by the long range of the snowclad cordillera but we viewed these grand mountains with regret for we were obliged to imagine their form and nature instead of standing as we had hoped on their crest and looking down on the plain below besides the useless loss of time which an attempt to ascend any higher would have cost us we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread this although really enough for any reasonable men was after our hard days march rather scanty food let those alone who have never tried it exclaim about the comfort of a light stomach and an easy digestion thbefore sunrise we commenced our descent we shot down the stream with great rapidity generally at the rate of ten knots an hour in this one day we effected what had cost us fiveandahalf hard days labour in ascending on the th we reached the beagle after our twentyone days expedition every one

natives bifurcation of beagle channel glaciers return to ship tierra del fuego december th having now finished with patagonia i will describe our first arrival in tierra del fuego a little after noon we doubled cape st diego and entered the famous strait of le maire we kept close to the fuegian shore but the outline of the rugged inhospitable staten land was visible amidst the clouds in the afternoon we anchored in the bay of good success while entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this savage land a group of fuegians partly concealed by the entangled forest were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea and as we passed by they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a loud and sonorous shout the savages followed the ship and just before dark we saw their fire and again heard their wild cry the harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low rounded mountains of clayslate which are covered to the waters edge by one dense gloomy forest a single glance at the landscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from any thing i had ever beheld at night it blew a gale of wind and heavy squalls from the mountains swept past us it would have been a bad time out at sea and we as well as others may call this good success bay in the morning the captain sent a party to communicate with the fuegians when we came within hail one of the four natives who were present advanced to receive us and began to shout most vehemently wishing to direct us where to land when we were on shore the party looked rather alarmed but continued talking and making gestures with great rapidity it was without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle i had ever beheld i could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal in as much as in man there is a greater power of improvement the chief spokesman was old and appeared to be the head of the family the three others were powerful young men about six feet high the women and children had been sent away these fuegians are a very different race from the stunted miserable wretches further to the westward they are much superior in person and seem closely allied to the famous patagonians of the strait of magellan their only garment consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin with the wool outside this they wear just thrown over their shoulders as often leaving their persons exposed as covered their skin is of a dirty coppery red colour the old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head which partly confined his black coarse and entangled hair his face was crossed by two broad transverse bars one painted bright red reached from ear to ear and included the upper lip the other white like chalk extended parallel and above the first so that even his eyelids were thus coloured some of the other men were ornamented by streaks of black powder made of charcoal the party altogether closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in such plays as der freischutz their very attitudes were abject and the expression of their countenances distrustful surprised and startled after we had presented them with some scarlet cloth which they immediately tied round their necks they became good friends this was shown by the old man patting our breasts and making a chuckling kind of noise as people do when feeding chickens i walked with the old man and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several times it was concluded by three hard slaps which were given me on the breast and back at the same time he then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment which being done he seemed highly pleased the language of these people according to our notions scarcely deserves to be called articulate captain cook has compared it to a man clearing his throat but certainly no european ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse guttural and clicking sounds they are excellent mimics as often as we coughed or yawned or made any odd motion they immediately imitated us some of our party began to squint and look awry but one of the young fuegians whose whole face was painted black excepting a white band across his eyes succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces they could repeat with perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them and they remembered such words for some time yet we europeans all know how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language which of us for instance could follow an american indian through a sentence of more than three words all savages appear to possess to an uncommon degree this power of mimicry i was told almost in the same words of the same ludicrous habits among the caffres the australians likewise have long been notorious for being able to imitate and describe the gait of any man so that he may be recognised how can this faculty be explained is it a consequence of the more practised habits of perception and keener senses common to all men in a savage state as compared to those long civilized when a song was struck up by our party i thought the fuegians would have fallen down with astonishment with equal surprise they viewed our dancing but one of the young men when asked had no objection to a little waltzing little accustomed to europeans as they appeared to be yet they knew and dreaded our firearms nothing would tempt them to take a gun in their hands they begged for knives calling them by the spanish word cuchilla they explained also what they wanted by acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth and then pretending to cut instead of tear it it was interesting to watch the conduct of these people towards jemmy button one of the fuegians who had been taken during the former voyage to england they immediately perceived the difference between him and the rest and held much conversation between themselves on the subject the old man addressed a long harangue to jemmy which it seems was to invite him to stay with them but jemmy understood very little of their language and was moreover thoroughly ashamed of his countrymen when york minster another of these men came on shore they noticed him in the same way and told him he ought to shave yet he had not twenty dwarf hairs on his face whilst we all wore our untrimmed beards they examined the colour of his skin and compared it with ours one of our arms being bared they expressed the liveliest surprise and admiration at its whiteness we thought that they mistook two or three of the officers who were rather shorter and fairer though adorned with large beards for the ladies of our party the tallest amongst the fuegians was evidently much pleased at his height being noticed when placed back to back with the tallest of the boats crew he tried his best to edge on higher ground and to stand on tiptoe he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned his face for a side view and all this was done with such alacrity that i dare say he thought himself the handsomest man in tierra del fuego after the first feeling on our part of grave astonishment was over nothing could be more ludicrous or interesting than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which these savages every moment exhibited the next day i attempted to penetrate some way into the country tierra del fuego may be described as a mountainous country partly submerged in the sea so that deep islets and bays occupy the place where valleys should exist the mountain sides except on the exposed western coast are covered from the waters edge upwards by one great forest the trees reach to an elevation of between and feet and are succeeded by a band of peat with minute alpine plants and this again is succeeded by the line of perpetual snow which according to captain king in the strait of magellan descends to between and feet to find an acre of level land in any part of the country is most rare i recollect only one little flat near port famine and another of rather larger extent near goeree road in both these cases and in all others the surface was covered by a thick bed of swampy peat even within the forest the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying vegetable matter which from being soaked with water yields to the foot finding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood i followed the course of a mountain torrent at first from the waterfalls and number of dead trees i could hardly crawl along but the bed of the stream soon became a little more open from the floods having swept the sides i continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and rocky banks and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene the gloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of violence on every side were lying irregular masses of rock and uptorn trees other trees though still erect were decayed to the heart and ready to fall the entangled mass of the thriving and the fallen reminded me of the forests within the tropicsyet there was a difference for in these still solitudes death instead of life seemed the predominant spirit i followed the watercourse till i came to a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the mountain side by this road i ascended to a considerable elevation and obtained a good view of the surrounding woods the trees all belong to one kind the fagus betuloides for the number of the other species of beech and of the winters bark is quite inconsiderable this tree keeps its leaves throughout the year but its foliage is of a peculiar brownishgreen colour with a tinge of yellow as the whole landscape is thus coloured it has a sombre dull appearance nor is it often enlivened by the rays of the sun december thone side of the harbour is formed by a hill about feet high which captain fitzroy has called after sir j banks in commemoration of his disastrous excursion which proved fatal to two of his party and nearly so to dr solander the snowstorm which was the cause of their misfortune happened in the middle of january corresponding to our july and in the latitude of durham i was anxious to reach the summit of this mountain to collect alpine plants for flowers of any kind in the lower part were few in number we followed the same watercourse as on the previous day till it dwindled away and then were compelled to crawl blindly among the trees these from the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds were low thick and crooked at length we reached that which from a distance appeared like a carpet of fine green turf but which to our vexation turned out to be a compact mass of little beechtrees about four or five feet high these were as thick together as box in the border of a flowergarden and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous surface after a little more trouble we gained the peat and then the bare slate rock a ridge connected this hill with another distant some miles and more lofty so that patches of snow were lying on it as the day was not far advanced i determined to walk there and collect along the road it would have been very hard work had it not been for a wellbeaten and straight path made by the guanacoes for these animals like sheep always follow the same line when we reached the hill we found it the highest in the immediate neighbourhood and the waters flowed to the sea in opposite directions we obtained a wide view over the surrounding country to the northward a swampy moorland extended but to the southward we had a scene of savage magnificence well becoming tierra del fuego there was a degree of mysterious grandeur in mountain behind mountain with the deep intervening valleys all covered by one thick dusky mass of forest the atmosphere likewise in this climate where gale succeeds gale with rain hail and sleet seems blacker than any where else in the strait of magellan looking due south from port famine the distant channels between the mountains appear from their gloominess to lead beyond the confines of this world december stthe beagle got under way and on the succeeding day favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze we closed in with the barnevelts and running past cape deceit with its stony peaks about three oclock doubled the weatherbeaten cape horn the evening was calm and bright and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding isles cape horn however demanded his tribute and before night sent us a gale of wind directly in our teeth we stood out to sea and on the second day again made the land when we saw on our weatherbow this notorious promontory in its proper formveiled in a mist and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water great black clouds were rolling across the heavens and squalls of rain with hail swept by us with extreme violence so that the captain determined to run into wigwam cove this is a snug little harbour not far from cape horn and here at christmaseve we anchored in smooth water the only thing which reminded us of the gale outside was every now and then a puff from the mountains which seemed to wish to blow us out of the water december thclose by the cove a pointed hill called katers peak rises to the height of feet the surrounding islands all consist of conical masses of greenstone associated sometimes with less regular hills of baked and altered clayslate this part of tierra del fuego may be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of mountains already alluded to the cove takes its name of wigwam from some of the fuegian habitations but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so called with equal propriety the inhabitants living chiefly upon shellfish are obliged constantly to change their place of residence but they return at intervals to the same spots as is evident from the pile of old shells which must often amount to some tons in weight these heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green colour of certain plants which invariably grow on them among these may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass two very serviceable plants the use of which has not been discovered by the natives the fuegian wigwam resembles in size and dimensions a haycock it merely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground and very imperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes the whole cannot be so much as the work of an hour and it is only used for a few days at goeree roads i saw a place where one of these naked men had slept which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare the man was evidently living by himself and york minster said he was very bad man and that probably he had stolen something on the west coast however the wigwams are rather better for they are covered with sealskins we were detained here several days by the bad weather the climate is certainly wretched the summer solstice was now passed yet every day snow fell on the hills and in the valleys there was rain accompanied by sleet the thermometer generally stood about but in the night fell to or from the damp and boisterous state of the atmosphere not cheered by a gleam of sunshine one fancied the climate even worse than it really was at a subsequent period the beagle anchored for a couple of days under wollaston island which is a short way to the northward while going on shore we pulled alongside a canoe with six fuegians these were the most abject and miserable creatures i any where beheld on the east coast the natives as we have seen have guanaco cloaks and on the west they possess sealskins amongst these central tribes the men generally possess an otterskin or some small scrap about as large as a pockethandkerchief which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins it is laced across the breast by strings and according as the wind blows it is shifted from side to side but these fuegians in the canoe were quite naked and even one fullgrown woman was absolutely so it was raining heavily and the fresh water together with the spray trickled down her body in another harbour not far distant a woman who was suckling a recentlyborn child came one day alongside the vessel and remained there whilst the sleet fell and thawed on her naked bosom and on the skin of her naked child these poor wretches were stunted in their growth their hideous faces bedaubed with white paint their skins filthy and greasy their hair entangled their voices discordant their gestures violent and without dignity viewing such men one can hardly make oneself believe they are fellowcreatures and inhabitants of the same world it is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the less gifted animals can enjoy how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to these barbarians at night five or six human beings naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals whenever it is low water they must rise to pick shellfish from the rocks and the women winter and summer either dive
