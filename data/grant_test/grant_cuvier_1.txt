on the life and writings of baron cuvier although the study of zoology is far from having yet acquired in britain that scientific character which it has long held on the continent there is obviously an increasing taste for the study of that interesting science and a more general perception of its utility since the exertions of the late sir t stamford raffles in its behalf the zoological treasures im ported from the east by that zealous patron of the science have enriched our previously existing collections and formed the nuclei of new museums and his influence has extended to the establishment of new societies menageries and journals devoted to the advancement of zoology the zoological society of london though instituted only four years ago is already one of the most numerous and respectable scientific societies of great britain and the study of zoology has recently begun to be placed on an equal footing with mineralogy and botany in the universities of england we anticipate that the taste thus recently excited for the study in this country will not be allowed to evaporate in mere admiration but that in imitation of our continental neighbours it will be improved and directed to the proper means of advancing the interests of the science in the mean time if we wish to view the study of animated nature in a form truly worthy of occupying a philosophic mind we must direct our attention to the french school where it has long formed a regular branch of academic education and the exclusive subject of study of men of distinguished abilities and learning and by no one has the science been more successfully cultivated than by the eminent author of the voluminous works announced at the head of this article in attempting to lay before our readers a brief and impartial sketch of the scientific labours of m cuvier we shall follow the chronological order of his numerous writings that we may be enabled to trace the progress of zoological discovery during the last forty years at the same time that we examine the merits of the successive changes this distinguished naturalist has intro duced into the science within the period of m cuviers career all the branches of natural history have been cultivated with increased ardour in the schools of europe and our acquaintance with the natural productions of the globe has been greatly extended by the rapid progress of geographical discovery by the advancement of all the collateral sciences and by the zeal and intelligence of european colonists and travellers in distant countries the liberal aid afforded to science by the french government and the consequent subdivision of mental labour among its cultivators in that country have enabled the scientific of france to maintain an ascendency over other countries of europe in those departments which necessarily required such aid for their successful cultivation and particu larly in zoology one of the most expensive of all the physical sciences the menagerie of the jardin du roi and the museums of natural history and comparative anatomy at paris which have grown for more than a century have long surpassed those of every other country of europe in their extent elegance and richness and in the extensive means of comparison which they thus present they afford an instrument of investigation in the study of natural history superior to that enjoyed by any other country these magnificent collections which owe much much to the early exertions of buffon and daubenton have been a means of spreading a taste for the study of zoology and comparative anatomy and have greatly contributed to the eminent success of the cultivators of these sciences in france the labours of m cuvier in these departments have extended over a period of nearly forty years they have greatly added to the reputation of the french school of naturalists and they have been a principal means of the rapid advancement of the study of animated nature in our times his comprehensive genius has shed its lustre over every department of this vast field of in quiry the existing races of the animal kingdom he has reviewed classified and defined their diversified structures he has exa mined and described numerous tribes of the extinct species have almost been recalled to life by his skill and perseverance and at the age of sixty his active and vigorous mind still continues with unabated ardour to explore new paths in that immense field of investigation which he has so long cultivated with unrivalled success george cuvier was born in the year at montbeliard a town now in the department of france called the upper rhine but which at the period of his birth belonged to wurtemberg one of the states of germany this town on the confines of germany has at least the glory of having given birth to the two illustrious cuviers to m duvernoy the present professor of natural history atstrasburg and to m laurillard the able assistant of m cuvier in the department of comparative anatomy m cuvier was born in the same year in the same month and nearly on the same day with napoleon whose intimacy he enjoyed during a great part of his perilous career and thus in very distant parts the same period gave birth to the two illustrious foreigners whose lives must be so much identified with the history of france and whose thoughts and actions have had so great an influence on the scientific and political world in later times his father was an officer in a swiss regiment in the service of france and chevalier of the order of military merit he retired after forty years service with a moderate pension from france and some time after he was made commandant of artillery at montbeliard cuvier received the early part of his education at the university of stuttgard the capital of wurtemberg where he resided for several years directing his attention to the study of mathematics philosophy law and jurisprudence with the view of qualifying himself for taking a share in the administration of his native country to which he was induced to look forward by the kind patronage shewn him by the late duke charles grand uncle of the present king of wurtemberg these early prospects of cuvier however were soon blasted by the events which agitated france towards the close of the last century and by which his native country became a part of a french province the grand displays of natural scenery in the mountainous country around stuttgard form an allurement to the study of natural history and there have long existed both museums and societies in that capital devoted to its advancement on leaving the university of stuttgard cuvier betook himself to france where he resided for some time on the coast of normandy and afterwards resorted to paris here he commenced his career as a private lecturer and was soon appointed to assist professor mertrud in the course of com parative anatomy delivered in the museum of natural history cuvier had already made himself favourably known to several of the most eminent naturalists of paris by his new and interesting observations on the structure of molluscous animals made while residing on the coast of france as tutor in the family of a nobleman his zeal and abilities were soon recog nized he was admitted a member of most of the learned societies of paris and before the age of twentynine he was appointed professor of natural history in the central school of the pantheon his election as a member of the institute of france on the first organization of that assembly in l gave a new impulse to his exertions and the numerous memoirs and discoveries which he laid before that learned body in the early part of his career greatly extended his reputation while they formed the bases of his more enlarged succeeding publications the structure of the animal frame in all the modifications it presents throughout the lower classes was always the favourite subject of his pursuits and he conti nued to discharge the duties of professor of comparative anatomy in the garden of plants to a late period notwithstanding the multiplicity of his other avocations the drawings which ac companied his numerous anatomical memoirs were all executed by himself and the beauty and elegance of his delineations are not less remarkable than the minuteness and accuracy of his descriptions most of these memoirs are published in the annales du museum the labours of daubenton mertrud and rousseau had already greatly extended the museum of comparative ana tomy before the task of completing it fell to m cuvier by his appointment to that chair in the garden of plants while he was professor of natural history in the pautheon and delivered lectures on comparative anatomy for mertrud in the garden of plants he published his first separate work the tableau elemental in this work forms an octavo volume of pages it presented a new distribution of the whole animal kingdom and it formed the basis of the two suc ceeding editions of the regne animal the principles of classibcation adopted in this early publication had already been partly developed by him in a separate memoir on a nese division of whiteblooded animals which he published at the age of twentysix three years before the appearance of the tableau elementaire in that early memoir which was read to the natural history society of paris on the th of may and printed in the decade philosophique cuvier first attacked linnffiuss division of the invertebrata into insects and worms and assigned the characters and limits of the new classes mollusca crustacea insecta vermes echinodermata and zoophyta the distribution of these invertebrate classes into three great divisions equal to the vertebrata was afterwards established by cuvier in a memoir read to the institute in july the classification of animals is one of the principal objects to which the researches both of the zoologist and comparative anatomist are directed without the assist ance derived from methodical arrangement the multitude and variety of objects belonging to the animal kingdom would continually impede our investigations and overpower the strongest mind the efforts of m cuvier were therefore early directed to this important point and the publication just mentioned is an outline of the course of lectures delivered by him at the pantheon on this subject in the animal kingdom is there divided into eight great classes four of verte brate animals mammalia aves reptilia pisces and four of invertebrate animals iollusca insecta vermes zoophyta the orders genera and many of the species of which are illustrated by ample details and the characters of all the dif ferent groups are illustrated by fourteen plates from his own pencil representing more than a hundred objects this work has not been translated into english but a portuguese transla tion of it by almeida was published in london in in vols vo after some interesting observations on the utility of the study of zoology and its applications to other sciences he details the properties which distinguish organized and sentient beings and gives an outline of the organization of the human body and the distinctions among the different races of mankind in treating of the mammalia he has somewhat improved the classification of professor storr of tubingen lie has adopted the nomenclature of linnaeus but he has greatly improved the characters of the genera and species by introducing more pre cise and detailed descriptions of the teeth taken from the skeletons preserved in the national museum the arrange ment of the class of birds has been taken from linnaeus and buffon and the descriptions are short and perspicuous from the limited means of observation which cuvier then possessed with regard to birds he considers this the most imperfect part of the volume the class of reptiles is divided into two orders oviparous quadrupeds and serpents the former com prehending the chelonia sauria and batrackia of brogniart and the later editions of the regne animal and the latter order comprehending the ophidia the divisions of the class of fishes are adopted from linnaeus they consist of six orders founded on the position of the fins and blumenbach had pre viously copied the same arrangement into his manual of natural history the cartilaginous fishes which are placed first in the work of blumenbach and in the tableau elemen taire the lecons danatomie comparee and likewise in the regne animal of have been properly thrown to the bottom of the class in the great work on the natural history of fishes and in the new edition of the regne animal as in their skeleton and other parts of their organization they approach to the molluscous animals the whole of the inverte brate animals are distributed into three great groups which correspond with the mollusca articulata and zoophyta of the regne animal the animals of the first division mollusca are characterized as having a muscular heart and no longitudinal knotted nervous cord those of the second division insects and worms have a longitudinal dorsal vessel and a knotted spinal cord or at least one of these two characters those of the third division zoophyta have neither heart nor brain nor nerves the mollusca are divided into the cephalopoda gasteropoda nuda gasteropoda testacea and acephala the last of these divisions comprehending lamarcks classes conchifera tunicata and cirrhipeda his next great division he terms insects and worms and comprehends under it all the crustacea arachnida insecta annelida and entozoa of later authors the arrangement of these is taken chiefly from linnaeus and fabricius and he was as fortunate in having the personal assistance of fabricius in regard to this class as he had been in obtaining that of lacepede for the classes of rep tiles and fishes and that of lamarck for the testaceous mollusca and the corals cuvier however has paid a minuter attention to the organs of manducation of insects in this work than had been done by his predecessors and has pointed out many im portant characters founded on these parts the division of his great group zoophyta is nearly the same as that of the regne animal with the exception of the entozoa being placed among the vermes in the tableau elementaire and the infusoria being placed between the acalepha and the true ramified zoophytes which terminate the volume throughout the whole of this elementary treatise he dis plays a practical acquaintance with the objects about which he treats and with the best authors who had preceded him the general observations prefixed to each division are judicious and appropriate and considering the state of the science at that time they contain much interesting and original information but in his desire to adapt the work to the capacity of his pupils he has overlooked the advantages of the strict methodi cal disposition of materials so conspicuous in the great masters whom he has followed the great zoological distinctions of classes orders genera c are supplied by cuvier by the more convenient division of chapters and the reader is some times left to guess the value of a subdivision by the size of the type employed in printing its description the investigations and the extent of reading necessary for the composition of a work like this designed to exhibit a summary of the whole animal kingdom must have greatly aided m cuvier in his demonstrations of comparative anatomy and the combination of his duties at the pantheon and at the college of france with those at the garden of plants may be considered as a principal cause of his eminent success in both the departments of zoology and comparative anatomy where the latter branch is studied only in connexion with human anatomy the know ledge acquired is generally limited to a superficial acquaintance with a few of the classes most nearly resembling man and when studied only in connexion with geology the acquaintance with it is generally limited to those hard parts of animals capable of being preserved in the strata of the earth and where zoology is cultivated without the aid of comparative anatomy the true principles of classification must be over looked and the most discordant arrangements will result from the attention being directed exclusively to external form from the wide range of m cuviers investigations and public duties he was often obliged to pass from the beaten path of his predecessors in treating of the anatomy of animals and to travel over ground which had been but little explored the tracks pointed out by pallas camper vicqdazir and dau benton were too common to engage his attention and he found in the obscure paths followed by swammerdam lister basterus and reaumur materials more calculated to extend the principles of physiology to enlarge the views of the anatomist and to advance the science of zoology than by con fining his inquiries to the vertebrate classes by his interest ing researches regarding the mollusca while residing in the south of france he became known to lametherie tessier olivier lacepede geoffroy and millin who invited him to come to paris and obtained for him the chair of zoology in the pantheon his earliest anatomical memoirs read before the institute of france were on animals the most remote from man his memoir on the medusae pointed out in animals two feet in diameter a structure nearly as simple as that of the infusoria the numerous memoirs which he published in the annates du museum on the anatomy of molluscous animals fill alone a quarto volume of nearly pages they contain descriptions of the structure of nearly fifty genera and are illustrated by thirtyfive elaborate plates from his own pencil these memoirs have rectified many of the errors or supplied the deficiencies of preceding observers and have thrown a new light on the most remarkable and unknown forms of organiza tion they have pointed out the true relations of these diversi fied beings to each other and by affording the means of divid ing them into natural and closely allied groups they have greatly facilitated the labours of the conchologist he has minutely detailed the anatomy of most of the known cephalo podous and pteropodous mollusca and of numerous genera of naked and testaceous gasteropoda his memoirs on the ascidia and other acephalous mollusca have been the means of illustrat ing the whole class of tunicated animals his memoir on the cirrhipeda has established the true relations of these singular animals in pointing out their numerous affinities with other articulated animals in their nervous system their respiratory organs and their articulated extremities and his concluding dissertation on the species of crustacea known to the ancients displays a happy union of extensive zoological knowledge with profound classical erudition a career of original investigation like that of m cuvier ill accords with the patience and labour required in extensive com pilations and although an elementary work on his favourite sub ject of comparative anatomy was still a desideratum in france he was too much impressed with the difficulty of the under taking and too eagerly engaged in a new train of investigation to undertake the composition of such a work fortunately for the science m cuvier found two able anatomists eager and qualified to reduce to the form of a system the vast materials employed by him in his courses of lectures on comparative anatomy m mertrud had been appointed to the newly created chair of comparative anatomy in the garden of plants but from his advanced age at that time he was induced by the advice of his colleagues to appoint cuvier as his substitute and in that capacity cuvier devoted himself to the extension of the zootomical museum and to the means of illustrating his lectures which were then attended by numerous assemblies on the death of mertrud who had been long assistant to daubenton cuvier succeeded him as professor of comparative anatomy on the st of november m dumeril who accomplished the two first volumes of the lecons danatomie compared comprehending the organs of motion and those of sensation was then at the head of the anatomical department of the school of medicine at paris and the composer of the three last volumes treating chiefly of the organs of digestion circulation respiration secretion and generation was dr duvernoy a relation of m cuvier a young and zealous anatomist and now the distinguished professor of natural history at strasburg m cuviers attention was at this time directed to the excavations in the gypsum strata of montmartre and his frequent excursions to that interesting theatre of geological events together with the labour of com paring the accumulations of bones daily extracted from the quarries with those of the skeletons preserved in the cabinet must have considerably distracted his attention from the com pilation of the lecons danatomie compared and left a large share of the merit of these volumes to the skilful anatomists who conducted them the first volume of the work is prefaced by a letter of twentytwo pages from cuvier to his zealous preceptor professor mertrud in which he explains with his usual eloquence and perspicuity the nature of the subject the particular scope of the work and the manner in which it was got up from his oral demonstrations the work is in five octavo volumes of about pages each it is illustrated by fiftytwo engraved plates and although it is now thirty years since it was published it still forms the most perspicuous correct and complete systematic view of the science which exists in any language in collecting materials for the work cuvier was aided by many donations of specimens from his friends and correspondents in distant parts he had liberty to dissect all the animals which died in the menagerie and even to open those rare species which had long been preserved in the museum in spirits cuvier and his pupils dissected in the large male elephant which had been pillaged along with many other zoological treasures from the stathouder in holland during the revolution he dissected another male elephant in and a female elephant a few years afterwards his younger brother m frederick cuvier was appointed keeper of the menagerie in and rendered cuvier great assistance in completing the series of skeletons of the museum of comparative anatomy which was first opened to public inspection in manuscript copies of m cuviers lectures on comparative anatomy taken by pupils from his oral demon strations had been circulated in paris and even cited in works before he undertook to publish them in a complete and con nected form and m dumeril had taken regular and ample notes from these demonstrations during four successive years the introductory lecture is full of original and highly interesting views of the animal economy and of the laws of organization the succeeding lectures of the first volume on the organs of motion treat of the osseous and muscular system of each division of the body commencing with the bones and muscles of the trunk those of the shoulder and anterior extremity then those of the pelvis and posterior extremity are described in all the classes of vertebrate animals the organs of motion in invertebrate animals are then examined and the first volume concludes with a lecture on the organs of motion considered in a state of action although it is convenient sometimes in teaching osteology to exhibit the organs by which the various motions of the bones are effected the introduction of the interesting details of myology is apt to fix the attention too exclusively on individual forms and to carry away the mind from those extensive comparisons which are required to illus trate the osteology of the lower animals and m cuvier has not been followed by succeeding writers in thus combining the osteology with the myology the second volume commences with the description of the head considered as the receptacle of the principal organs of sense the brain and nerves are then considered and the organs of sight hearing touch smell and taste are examined at great length a period of five years elapsed between the publication of the first two volumes of the lecons and the succeeding three during which time m cuvier was elected perpetual secretary of the french institute an office which his genius learning and indefatigable research still continue to adorn cuvier was secretary of the institute so early as when that office was only temporary and of two years duration he had been the third elected since the beginning of the institute at this time napoleon returned from egypt and declared first consul was made president of the institute which brought cuvier into frequent personal intercourse with his future sovereign in napoleon desiring to reorganize the schools of france appointed six general inspectors to establish lyceums in thirty cities of the empire cuvier was made one and in that capacity he established the first lyceums now royal colleges of mar seilles and bourdeaux it was while absent from paris on this embassy that the secretaries of the institute were made perpetual and cuvier was appointed to that of the physical sciences when at marseilles he availed himself of the favourable opportunity to extend his inquiries into the structure of the mollusca during this interval the two first volumes of the lecons were translated into the english language but the same respect has not been shown to the other three which are not inferior in merit the translation of these two volumes was executed by mr ross with the careful revisal of professor macartney of dublin a translation of the first lecture which contains a luminous view of the laws of animal economy had been published in a separate form by mr allan surgeon of edinburgh the numerous avocations both of m dumeril and m cuvier prevented them from devoting the time and attention to the concluding volumes which they had devoted to the preceding and dr duvernoy though aided by the manuscript notes of the former and the plates preparations descriptions and regular revisal of the latter had many dis sections to perform and repeat and many deficiencies to supply in his difficult and meritorious task of completing the work cuvier had opportunities of dissecting many rare and unknown animals while the later volumes of the comparative anatomy were preparing partly from the menageries of the garden of plants and of malmaison and partly brought from a distance in spirits by geoffroy and savigny from egypt by peron from australasia by humboldt from america by homberg and fleuriau from the coasts of france and by cuvier himself from the mediterranean in his interesting letter to lacepede pro fessor of zoology in the museum of natural history inserted at the beginning of the third volume he details briefly the progress of comparative anatomy during the five preceding years and the important influence which his own researches for fifteen years had exerted in reforming the methodical arrangements of zoologists the absurd classifications of the linnaan school founded solely on external form or on a single character and the necessary dependance of correct zoological ar rangements on the progress and application of zootomical know ledge are also pointed out with great distinctness and ability the organs of digestion form the subject of the third volume and in treating of this function many important parts of the system are described with great minuteness and detail the form structure and motions of the jaws j the teeth of mam malia reptiles and fishes the salivary glands the organs of mastication and deglutition the structure and peculiarities of the oesophagus stomach and intestinal canal throughout the various classes of animals are successively described and in every part illustrated with original observations the pecu liarities of the liver pancreas and spleen and the digestive apparatus of invertebrate animals form the first subjects of the fourth volume the heart and circulating organs the organs of respiration in land and aquatic animals and the organs of voice so intimately connected with atmospheric respiration are de scribed at great length in the same volume the organs of generation and those of excretion occupy the fifth volume throughout these volumes the parts which relate to the organi zation of insects and molluscous animals are the exclusive pro ductions of m cuvier and probably no anatomist then living besides himself was qualified to undertake these obscure parts of zootomy in what relates to the digestive system of the mammalia nearly all the interesting facts collected by dauben ton in his description of the cabinet have been incorporated in the tables of the classification of the whole animal kingdom added to this work many important improvements are intro duced into the arrangements of the tableau elementaire partly resulting from m cuviers own more extended inquiries and partly adopted from the eminent writers who during this period had illustrated many separate branches of zoology in what relates to the classification of quadrupeds and birds he has availed himself of the improvements introduced by lacepede and in the arrangement of the testaceous mollusca he has been assisted by the labours of lamarck the vermes and crustacea here form two classes distinct from that of insects the former arrangement of reptiles taken from lacepede is changed for the more convenient subdivisions of brogniart into chelonia sauria ophidia and batrachia the entozoa are placed provisionally in the class of vermes and the infusoria still succeed the medusae in the class of zoophytes during the composition of the lecons m cuvier had col lected many interesting observations regarding the fossil bones accumulated in the strata around paris in his visit to italy he had examined the situations most famed for the fossil remains of animals they afforded and many distinguished naturalists had sent him from distant parts of europe remains or drawings or descriptions of animals found in a fossil state the immense collection of skeletons preserved in the cabinet of comparative anatomy at paris afforded him the means of instituting the necessary comparisons of the fossil with the existing species and must have greatly assisted and encouraged him in his early attempts to decipher the remains of the higher classes of animals so frequently submitted to his inspection the certainty of the truths thus brought to light the novelty of the results and their important applications to the hitherto fanciful speculations of geology excited the liveliest interest among the naturalists of europe to the curious and novel investigations of m cuvier and the success of his labours in identifying the fossil bones of the mammalia affords the most splendid illustration of the utility of zootomical knowledge as applied to geological investi gation which has yet been recorded in the history of that science the opportunities which m cuvier enjoyed for prosecuting these geological inquiries were such as no natura list ever before possessed but it must also be said that no man ever before possessed in a more eminent degree than cuvier all the requisite qualifications for the successful em ployment of these advantages his indefatigable industry and his enthusiasm in these pursuits his practical acquaintance with all the collateral sciences and his extensive general know ledge the beauty of his language and the elevated tone of his descriptions the extent and grandeur of his general views and the sublime truths they have unfolded regarding the past revolu tions of the animal kingdom and of the globe we inhabit convince us that no other naturalist in his situation could have so successfully performed what he has accomplished in regard to the restoration of extinct species of animals these re searches now occupy seven large quarto volumes illustrated with more than two hundred engraved plates they have made us acquainted with at least seventy species of animals before entirely unknown to naturalists and have pointed out the occur rence of eleven or twelve known existing species in a fossil state besides many other species of animals which have not yet been identified cuvier was appointed in one of the councillors for life of the imperial university which was created that year by napoleon this sedentary appointment accorded well with that of perpetual secretary of the institute and led cuvier often to discuss affairs of administration before the council of state and in presence of the emperor in this capacity he was sent in and to organize the academies of the italian states which had been recently added to the empire and the judicious arrangements which he made at turin genoa and pisa were found so advantageous that at the return of the respective sovereigns of these states the measures adopted by cuvier were preserved inviolate in he had a similar mission to holland and the hanse towns and many of the changes and nominations which he made there are still re spected and preserved when at hamburgh he was informed that the emperor had conferred upon him the title of chevalier with an hereditary endowment though a protestant by country birth and education he was sent in to organize the uni versity of rome and some of the improvements which he introduced into the university of la sapienza were retained even after the return of the pope when in that city he re ceived intelligence of his appointment as master of requests a place in the ministry to which he had been called by a personal resolution of napoleon who was acquainted with the acts of cuviers administration as councillor of the university both from his own observation and from the favourable report of fontane during his numerous missions through the vast territories formerly subservient to france on affairs connected with the state cuvier never omitted the opportunities they afforded him of prosecuting his favourite scientific investiga tions the great accumulations of the bones of elephants which m cuvier saw in italy convinced him that they could not have belonged to the few animals of this species lost by hannibal in traversing that country but must have belonged to species inhabiting that part of the globe at a much more remote period the same cause is assigned by him for their remains occurring in england ireland germany denmark norway poland russia siberia and in the islands and shores of the polar seas kotzebue found them common on the coasts of america within the arctic circle and parry in melville island where the tem perature is now frequently fifty degrees below the freezing point the great animal of the ohio has been restored by cuvier the bones of which were considered by daubenton to belong to the elephant and hippopotamus cuvier has identified different species of this animal to which he has given the name mastodon from the nipplelike form of the grinding teeth the fossil hippopotami and rhinoceroses which are so abundant in the valley of the arno cuvier has been enabled to ascertain by means of the skeletons of the recent species he has procured for the museum the rhinoceros of caffreria described by sir e home as similar to the fossil species was shown by m cuvier to differ from the latter in not having the septum of the nostrils ossified as in the allied fossil species the pretended fossil human skeleton of scheuchzer which camper suspected to be that of a lizard was carefully examined by cuvier when at haerlem where it is preserved in the museum and shewn to to be what he had previously announced it to be a gigantic salamander cuvier examined at pavia the collection of fossil bones brought from the island of cerigo and asserted by spallanzani to be remains of the human species and found that not a single fragment of them had ever formed a part of a human skeleton but were all remains of ruminating animals he has determined nearly twelve species of the extinct genus palaeotherium some of which were nearly as large as a rhino ceros they appear from the shells which are found along with their bones to have frequented the banks of rivers and marshes the immense accumulations of bones found in the caves of gaylenreuth on the frontiers of bayreuth cuvier found to have belonged almost entirely to extinct species of bears which must have lived and died peaceably in the situations where we now discover their remains the remarkable fossil animal of south america the megatherium which measures twelve feet in length and six or seven in height and the megalonyx nearly as large cuvier has ascertained to have been closely allied in their general characters to the sloths and anteaters of that country he has found the bones of a species of opossum in the gypsum quarries of paris and thus confuted the opinion of those who maintained all such bones to have been flooded north from asia as the animals of this genus are inhabitants only of the new world two species of seals have been discovered by cuvier in the coarse marine lime stone of the department of the maine and loire one of which is nearly three times as large as the common species still inha biting our seas and in the same locality he has found two unknown species of lamantins his labours have been scarcely less productive in the class of reptiles of which he has pointed out many extraordinary and gigantic species found in a fossil state from the examination of the numerous extinct species of animals found in the gypsum quarries of montmartre cuvier avas naturally led to study the nature and superposition of the various strata containing them and in conjunction with m brongniart professor of mineralogy he undertook a laborious and extensive examination of the geological structure of the paris basin and of the surrounding country the results of their investigations form an important part of the great work on fossil organic remains and one of the most valuable con tributions which geology has ever received they have shown the country around that capital to be formed by a succession of marine and freshwater deposits as if by the flux and efflux of salt and fresh water over that extensile district above the chalk which forms the bottom of the great basin they ex amined rest the plastic clay and coarse marine limestone both containing as well as the chalk itself remains of marine animals on these strata rests the great gypsum freshwater formation containing remains of quadrupeds birds and reptiles and of fishes and shells belonging to freshwater species marl and sandstone containing the remains of marine animals lie on the gypsum formation and these are covered with beds of flint and silicious limestone abounding with fresh water shells all these strata are covered with a darkcoloured carbdnaceous alluvium composed of sand marl and clay and containing trunks of trees and bones of elephants oxen and other large quadrupeds these interesting geological details occupy more than six hundred pages and are illustrated with geological maps and numerous sections of strata not only of the paris basin but also of similar formations in italy swit zerland and germany numerous plates are also given of the invertebrate animals which occur in these beds and which have been carefully identified by lamarck defrance audouin and other zoologists in what relates to the fossil vegetables many of which are figured the work has been assisted by the late re rearches of m adolphus brogniart the preliminary discourse in the first volume of this work contains so many grand and original views of the revolutions which have taken place on the surface of this globe and in the animal kingdom and is composed in a style at once so profound elegant and attractive that it has long been translated into the english language both in this country and in america and more recently also into the german language the translations of dr mitchel of new york and professor jameson of edinburgh are enriched with numerous original notes and illustrations and the translation of the latter has gone through five large editions the original discourse is now published in paris as a separate work and both in an octavo and quarto form besides the preliminary discourse and the elaborate memoirs on the osteology of the recent and extinct species of elephants and hippopotami and on the remains of the fossil mastodons the first volume contains a dissertation on the ibis so much revered by the ancient egyptians in which he has attempted to show by an examination of several mummies of the bird from the tombs of thebes and from historical documents that it still exists in that country as in the time of the pharaohs and that it has under gone no perceptible change in its form since that remote period in treating of the other pachydermatous animals in the second volume which is chiefly occupied with the geology of the paris formation m cuvier has entered into the same minute and ex tended details of the osteology of the living species along with that of the extinct races as in the preceding volume and the same plan has been followed throughout the whole of this vast undertaking the labour of collecting materials for so great a work during his travels and surveys in various parts of europe and the task of arranging and describing them might be thought sufficient to have occupied the greater part of m cuviers life but they have afforded him leisure not only for his numerous important public avocations and for the composition of works even more elaborate but also to draw and even to engrave with his own hands some of the most detailed osteological plates con tained in this voluminous work the third volume is principally occupied with a detailed account of the means employed to restore the species of pachydermatous animals found in the gypsum quarries around paris by the careful examination and comparison of their separate bones it is illustrated with eighty quarto engraved plates the greater part of which are from the pencil of cuviers able assistant laurillard one of the most skilful anatomical designers in europe it is fortunate for the interests of ichthyology that the same accurate and elegant draughtsman has undertaken the elaborate folio anatomical plates of the great work on fishes now publishing by cuvier and valenciennes in determining the fossil remains of the mam malia cuvier considers the examination of the molar teeth as affording by far the most important characters by these we at once perceive whether an animal is carnivorous or herbivorous and when it belongs to the latter order we can generally deter mine by the forms of these teeth the particular kind of herbi vorous animals to which it is most nearly allied cuvier was induced to commence his researches with the pachydermata from their occurring in most abundance in the newest alluvial formations from the great size of their bones and the facility of identifying the species and from the imperfect state of our knowledge regarding the osteology of these gigantic inhabitants of tropical climates besides the extended descriptions of the palseotheria and anoplotheria this volume contains an account of other pachydermatous animals and of carnivora rodentia a species of opossum the remains of birds tortoises crocodiles and fishes which occur along with them in the same gypsum formation and the whole is terminated by a lengthened mono graph on the fossil vegetation of the environs of paris by m a brogniart the ruminating animals differ remarkably in several of their characters from the other orders of mammalia as in the imper fection of their dental system in the structure of their stomach and in the forms of their horns yet they resemble each other so much and are so numerous that their discrimination is attended with great difficulty both with regard to the recent animals and the extinct species important generic characters are often taken from the form of their horns those most changeable of all their external parts according to their age sex and climate to facilitate his researches into this numerous tribe of fossil mam malia m cuvier in his fourth volume enters at considerable length into the characters of the existing species as taken from the teeth the head and the rest of the skeleton and then describes the different fossil species of deers oxen and other ruminating animals determined chiefly by their horns and found in various situations in france germany and other parts of europe he has attempted in the same manner to decipher the bones of the ruminating animals found in so great abundance in osseous brecchias in fissures and caves at gibraltar cette antibes nice uliveto cape palinurus corsica sardinia sicily dalmatia cerigo concud and verona his views in regard to the antiquity of these osseous accumulations in caves and fissures have been modified by the interesting discoveries and conclusions of our zealous and learned countryman professor buckland and he agrees with this eminent geologist as to the manner in which these bones have been collected together and enveloped in the diluvium m cuvier proceeds in the same manner with the numerous order of carnivorous animals as with the ruminantia to determine the osteological characters of the various existing races before attempting to identify the fossil species the teeth present very important and useful discrimi nating characters both in the carnivora and rodentia from the striking diversities they exhibit in the genera of these orders in determining the fossil species of these animals m cuvier was greatly aided by the elaborate and useful work which his brother had undertaken at his request on the forms and arrangement of the teeth in all the existing genera of this class this volume concludes with the description of the discovered fossil species of bears hyaenas wolves foxes and other small carnivorous animals and the whole of the details are illustrated with numerous valuable plates representing chiefly the forms of the teeth the jaws the entire crania and other essential parts of the osteology the osteology of the rodentia edentata and marine mammalia and the investigation of the fossil species of these orders occupy the first part of the fifth volume which is illustrated with twentyseven plates representing the skeletons and the separate bones of many rare and interesting animals as the echidna the ornithorhyncus the dtigohg the lamantin and several cetaceous animals scarcely to be met with in any other museums but that of the garden of plants the number of rodentia appears to have been as great in the ancient world as at present and most of the species appear to have been small as those now met with in a luring state after showing the gradual transition to this order of quadrupeds in the systems of dentition presented by the bpecies belonging to the marsupial genera phalangista macro pus and phascolomys cuvier details the characters of the order rodentia and of the recent genera it comprehends and enters particularly into the description of the molar teeth the form of the head and the characters which may be obtained from the other parts of the skeleton in treating of the fossil rodentia particularly those found in cares he has given a full account of the interesting researches of dr btickland in regard to the species of this order met with in the cares of kirkdale and has endeavoured to identify some of the separate bones of these animals represented in the plates of the keliquia diluvianje these bones appear to have belonged chiefly to species of mice rats and hares the trogontheriutn cuvieri is a large fossil spe cies belonging to this order and agreeing in all its characters with the genus castor it was found on the sandy banks of the sea of azof and measures a fifth larger than the recent species of europe or america the skeletons of those singular quadrupeds the sloths anteaters and mortotremata are the next described in this volume cuvier was the firt to point out to daubenton thirty years ago the remarkable irregularity observed in the cervical vertebra of the sloth called the ai where their num ber amounts to nine being two more than are met with in almost all the other mammalia the great length of the anterior ex tremities of this animal and of some other sloths is regarded by cuvier as a principal cause of their remarkable slowness of motion and of their feebleness they present likewise remark able peculiarities in the form of the pelvis and in the union of its parts in the mode of articulation of the hind feet in the rigidity of all the parts of the toes in the manner in which the long nails are folded under the feet during a state of rest and in the articulations of the scapula and clavicle the details on the osteology of the monotremata contained in this volume though not applied to the determination of any fossil remains form a most valuable contribution towards the anatomy of these most singular of all the animals hitherto brought from new holland and whose structure and nature have so much per plexed the most eminent anatomists of europe it is remark able that notwithstanding the knowledge we possess of the anatomy of the ornithorhyncus one of these monotremataj naturalists are not agreed as to the class to which that animal belongs cuvier regarding it as a viviparous quadruped lesson as a bird allied to the penguin and geoffroy st hilaire as belonging to an oviparous class between quadrupeds and birds the only fossil species hitherto discovered belonging to the order edentataj are the megalonyx of jefferson from north america the great megatherium from paraguay and another gigantic though still unknown species of which cuvier has only been able to examine the plaster model of a phalanx found in a pit of sand and gravel supposed to have been formed by deposition from the rhine near eppelsheim in hesse the fossil species of marine mammalia are much more numerous and cuvier has described and figured the remains of extinct species of seals lamantins dolphins narwals whales and cetaceous animals allied to the hyperoodons and cachalots which he is particularly enabled to illustrate by means of the rich collection of these animals preserved in his museum in the garden of plants he has not however described all the remains of these animals in his possession but has selected only those which afforded the means of being satisfactorily determined by thus pointing out many species of marine mammalia which are now extinct he has further confirmed the conclusion to which naturalists had been led by the study of fossil conchology that not only the productions of the land have been changed by the revolutions which have taken place on the surface of the globe but that the sea itself the chief agent in most of these revolutions has changed its inhabitants the gigantic bulk and force of the cetacea have not better protected their species in the ocean than the size and strength of the elephants rhinoceroses hippopotami mastodons and megatheria have enabled them to resist on land the revolutions which have destroyed their race it is not a little remarkable that among the fossil remains of vertebrate animals there should so seldom be found the bones either of birds or of serpents this cannot be ascribed merely to the delicacy of their skeleton and the consequent difficulty of preserving it in the rocky strata or of collecting its parts from these ancient beds as we find in many of the older strata the skeletons of the smallest fishes preserved with the most delicate spines of their fins uninjured the saurian reptiles are much more common and the batrachia are also frequently found in a fossil state the crocodile of all the saurian reptiles presents the nearest affinities in its oste ology to that of the mammalia in determining the nature of its separate bones their relative position is examined the muscles which are attached to them arc considered the blood vessels and nerves which pass through their foramina are ascertained and all similar indications are carefully sought for and applied from this determination of the bones particulary those of the head of the crocodile we obtain a solution of the more difficult analogies in the osteology of the other saurian rep tiles and likewise of the tortoises and serpents the batrachian reptiles present anomalies which require a different kind of investigation from that of the other orders of their class m cuvier deprecates as visionary the ingenious views of those who endeavour to decipher the osteology of the cranium of these animals by comparing the bones of the head of verte brate animals to a series of dilated vertebrae after thus care fully determining the osteology of each of the recent genera of reptiles and illustrating all the details with large engravings he proceeds in the last part of the fifth volume of this stupen dous monument of his profound zootomical knowledge and indefatigable spirit of research to examine the characters of the remarkable extinct species of these animals the remains of reptiles occupy a series of strata much more ancient than those which contain the fossil bones of mammalia even of the aquatic species the chalk formation and all the strata of anterior date present no trace of the former existence of mam miferous animals which are all confined to newer formations but the chalk strata and all the older strata of the secondary series to the great coal formation abound with remains of tor toises crocodiles and lizards which have even left distinct traces of their footsteps on the now solid sandstones of the latter formation as in the sandstone quarries of dumfriesshire in scotland although very few of these animals are now found in strata newer than the chalk at the remote period alluded to only coldblooded reptiles moved upon the dry land and the bottom of the sea was peopled with species of ammo nites belemnites terebratulites encrinites and many other genera now almost entirely extinct after establishing the division of the great family of croco diles into three subgenera of alligators crocodiles properly so called and gavials the first of which is distinguished by having the fourth tooth of the lower jaw on each side received into a depression of the upper jawbone and by having the feet semi palmated the second by the same tooth on each side of the lower jaw passing through a distinct fissure of the upper maxillary bones the feet palmaled and the beak oblong and the gavials forming the third division are distinguished from the other two subgenera by having an elongated cylindrical beak and palmated feet m cuvier examines with great minuteness and detail the separate bones of the living species of crocodiles the bones of the head are carefully compared with the corresponding bones of the mammalia the bones of the trunk and extremities are illustrated with equal detail and the whole skeleton is contrasted with those of the alligators and gavials at present existing the fossil species of these animals are next described both those known to preceding observers and those ascertained by m cuvier the gavial of the calca reous slates of franconia described by soemmerring that of the limestone quarries of caen and the bones of two unknown species found near honfleur and havre are described at great length several crocodiles have been found in the chalk and in the strata immediately adjacent above and beneath that for mation as in the chalk of mendon in the ferruginous sand beneath the chalk in sussex in the plastic clay of auteuil and in provence and the island of sheppy remains of these reptiles are likewise described by cuvier found along with the palaeotheriums and lophiodons in formations newer than the chalk and which not only differ from the more ancient species but distinctly approach in their characters to the existing races as in the gypsum quarries in the marl of argenton in the gravel beds of castelnaudary those found near blaye and those found at brentford and at mans m cuvier has described in the same manner the recent and fossil species of chelonian reptiles the land and fresh water tortoises and those which still inhabit the sea and the fossil species found in various parts of italy france switzer land germany and england after describing the general osteology of the recent species of lizards he examines the facts connected with the fossil monitors found at thuringen and other parts of germany the great saurian reptile found in the quarries of maestricht the gigantic lizard discovered by soemmerring near monheim and termed geosaurus by cuvier the huge megalosaurus found by buckland in the polite of stonesfield near oxford the saurian reptile discovered by gaillardeau in the quarries of compact limestone near lune ville and the four discovered species of pterodactylus a genus distinguished by the extraordinary length of the fourth toe of the anterior extremities the observations and plates illustrative of the osteology of the recent species of batra chian reptiles form a valuable contribution to comparative anatomy and the details regarding the fossil bones of the great em principally by english naturalists have enabled m cuvier to represent in his concluding plate the entire skeletons of these extraordinary aquatic reptiles as they existed in our ancient seas the views of m cuyier regarding the extinct races of verte brate animals and the facts he had collected relating to them were first published as a series of detached memoirs in the annales du museum dhistoire naturelle and in these memoirs were collected by the author connected together by means of supplementary articles and a preliminary discourse and published as a separate work forming the first edition of his recherches sur les ossemens fossiles in four quarto volumes a second edition was published in in five volumes quarto after nearly ten years of continued research in the same interesting field of inquiry in various parts of europe m cuvier commenced in a new edition of the work which was completed in in seven quarto volumes though forming only five according to the plan of the work it has been recently reprinted with a new edition of the pre liminary discourse this work which is the greatest monument of the genius learning and industry of cuvier has reformed the science of geology and greatly advanced our knowledge of comparative anatomy and is justly styled by our most eminent mineralogist professor jameson the most splendid contribution to natural history furnished by any individual of this age the writings and researches of cuvier however have not always been limited to the animal creation he has for many years been in the habit of employing his leisure hours in collecting the most interesting historical facts in examining the scientific labours and in composing biographical memoirs of the most eminent members of the french institute who have died during that period these historical discourses are designed to commemorate the services rendered to science by the most distinguished members of that learned body and are generally composed and read before the royal academy of sciences soon after the decease of any of its most valuable associates the biographical memoirs composed by m cuvier on such occasions during a period of nearly thirty years and read before the institute of france have been recently collected and published as a separate work which consists of three octavo volumes all the most interesting memoirs of these volumes have been translated into the english language and published separately in our periodical journals the first volume com mences with an interesting sketch of the progress of the sciences and their influence on human society which was read at the opening of the academy in and contains historical sketches of the
