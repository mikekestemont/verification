far on the difference in nature between the present sandy beaches and the calcareous bottom on which the embedded shells must have lived on the bare surface of the calcareous plain or in a thin covering of sand there were lying at a height from to feet many recent shells which had a much fresher appearance than the embedded ones fragments of the concholepas and of the common mytilus still retaining a tinge of its colour were numerous and altogether there was manifestly a closer approach in proportional numbers to those now lying on the beach in a mass of stratified slightly agglutinated sand which in some places covers up the lower half of the seaward escarpment of the plain the included shells appeared to be in exactly the same proportional numbers with those on the beach on one side of a steepsided ravine cutting through the plain behind herradura bay i observed a narrow strip of stratified sand containing similar shells in similar proportional numbers a section of the ravine is represented in the following diagram which serves also to show the general composition of the plain i mention this case of the ravine chiefly because without the evidence of the marine shells in the sand any one would have supposed that it had been hollowed out by simple alluvial action the escarpment of the fringelike plain which stretches for eleven miles along the coast is in some parts fronted by two or three narrow stepformed terraces one of which at herradura bay expands into a small plain its surface was there formed of gravel cemented together by calcareous matter and out of it i extracted the following recent shells which are in a more perfect condition than those from the upper plain on the syenitic ridge which forms the southern boundary of herradura bay and plain i found the concholepas and turritella cingulata mostly in fragments at the height of feet above the sea i could not have told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by man if i had not found one very small mass of them cemented together in a friable calcareous tuff i mention this fact more particularly because i carefully looked in many apparently favourable spots at lesser heights on the side of this ridge and could not find even the smallest fragment of a shell this is only one instance out of many proving that the absence of seashells on the surface though in many respects inexplicable is an argument of very little weight in opposition to other evidence on the recent elevation of the land the highest point in this neighbourhood at which i found upraised shells of existing species was on an inland calcareous plain at the height of feet above the sea it would appear from mr caldcleughs researches that a rise has taken place here within the last century and a half and as no sudden change of level has been observed during the not very severe earthquakes which have occasionally occurred here the rising has probably been slow like that now or quite lately in progress at chiloe and at valparaiso there are three wellknown rocks called the pelicans which in according to feuillée were à fleur deau but now are said to stand twelve feet above lowwater mark the springtides rise here only five feet there is another rock now nine feet above highwater mark which in the time of frezier and of feuillée rose only five or six feet out of water mr caldcleugh i may add also shows and i received similar accounts that there has been a considerable decrease in the soundings during the last twelve years in the bays of coquimbo concepcion valparaiso and guasco but as in these cases it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the accumulation of sediment and the upheavement of the bottom i have not entered into any details valley of coquimbothe narrow coastplain sends as before stated an arm or more correctly a fringe on both sides but chiefly on the southern side several miles up the valley these fringes are worn into steps or terraces which present a most remarkable appearance and have been compared though not very correctly by capt basil hall to the parallel roads of glen roy in scotland their origin has been ably discussed by mr lyell the first section which i will give is not drawn across the valley but in an east and west line at its mouth where the stepformed terraces debouch and present their very gently inclined surfaces towards the pacific the bottom plain a is about a mile in width and rises quite insensibly from the beach to a height of twentyfive feet at the foot of the next plain it is sandy and abundantly strewed with shells plain or terrace b is of small extent and is almost concealed by the houses of the town as is likewise the escarpment of terrace c on both sides of a ravine two miles south of the town there are two little terraces one above the other evidently corresponding with b and c and on them marine remains of the species already enumerated were plentiful terrace e is very narrow but quite distinct and level a little southward of the town there were traces of a terrace d intermediate between e and c terrace f is part of the fringelike plain which stretches for the eleven miles along the coast it is here composed of shingle and is feet higher than where composed of calcareous matter this greater height is obviously due to the quantity of shingle which at some former period has been brought down the great valley of coquimbo considering the many shells strewed over the terraces a b and c and a few miles southward on the calcareous plain which is continuously united with the upper steplike plain f there cannot i apprehend be any doubt that these six terraces have been formed by the action of the sea and that their five escarpments mark so many periods of comparative rest in the elevatory movement during which the sea wore into the land the elevation between these periods may have been sudden and on an average not more than seventytwo feet each time or it may have been gradual and insensibly slow from the shells on the three lower terraces and on the upper one and i may add on the three gravelcapped terraces at conchalee being all littoral and sublittoral species and from the analogical facts given at valparaiso and lastly from the evidence of a slow rising lately or still in progress here it appears to me far more probable that the movement has been slow the existence of these successive escarpments or old clifflines is in another respect highly instructive for they show periods of comparative rest in the elevatory movement and of denudation which would never even have been suspected from a close examination of many miles of coast southward of coquimbo we come now to the terraces on the opposite sides of the east and west valley of coquimbo the following section is taken in a north and south line across the valley at a point about three miles from the sea the valley measured from the edges of the escarpments of the upper plain f f is about a mile in width but from the bases of the bounding mountains it is from three to four miles wide the terraces marked with an interrogative do not exist on that side of the valley but are introduced merely to render the diagram more intelligible on the inclination of the terraces of coquimbo and on the upper and basal edges of their escarpments not being horizontalthe surfaces of these terraces slope in a slight degree as shown by the last two sections taken conjointly both towards the centre of the valley and seawards towards its mouth this double or diagonal inclination which is not the same in the several terraces is as we shall immediately see of simple explanation there are however some other points which at first appear by no means obviousnamely first that each terrace taken in its whole breadth from the summitedge of one escarpment to the base of that above it and followed up the valley is not horizontal nor have the several terraces when followed up the valley all the same inclination thus i found the terraces c e and f measured at a point about two miles from the mouth of the valley stood severally between fiftysix to seventyseven feet higher than at the mouth again if we look to any one line of cliff or escarpment neither its summitedge nor its base is horizontal on the theory of the terraces having been formed during a slow and equable rise of the land with as many intervals of rest as there are escarpments it appears at first very surprising that horizontal lines of some kind should not have been left on the land the direction of the diagonal inclination in the different terraces being differentin some being directed more towards the middle of the valley in others more towards its mouthnaturally follows on the view of each terrace being an accumulation of successive beachlines round bays which must have been of different forms and sizes when the land stood at different levels for if we look to the actual beach of a narrow creek its slope is directly towards the middle whereas in an open bay or slight concavity on a coast the slope is towards the mouth that is almost directly seaward hence as a bay alters in form and size so will the direction of the inclination of its successive beaches become changed if it were possible to trace any one of the many beachlines composing each sloping terrace it would of course be horizontal but the only lines of demarcation are the summit and basal edges of the escarpments now the summitedge of one of these escarpments marks the furthest line or point to which the sea has cut into a mass of gravel sloping seaward and as the sea will generally have greater power at the mouth than at the protected head of a bay so will the escarpment at the mouth be cut deeper into the land and its summitedge be higher consequently it will not be horizontal with respect to the basal or lower edges of the escarpments from picturing in ones mind ancient bays entirely surrounded at successive periods by cliffformed shores ones first impression is that they at least necessarily must be horizontal if the elevation has been horizontal but here is a fallacy for after the sea has during a cessation of the elevation worn cliffs all round the shores of a bay when the movement recommences and especially if it recommences slowly it might well happen that at the exposed mouth of the bay the waves might continue for some time wearing into the land whilst in the protected and upper parts successive beachlines might be accumulating in a sloping surface or terrace at the foot of the cliffs which had been lately reached hence supposing the whole line of escarpment to be finally uplifted above the reach of the sea its basal line or foot near the mouth will run at a lower level than in the upper and protected parts of the bay consequently this basal line will not be horizontal and it has already been shown that the summitedges of each escarpment will generally be higher near the mouth from the seaward sloping land being there most exposed and cut into than near the head of the bay therefore the total height of the escarpments will be greatest near the mouth and further up the old bay or valley they will on both sides generally thin out and die away i have observed this thinning out of the successive escarpment at other places besides coquimbo and for a long time i was quite unable to understand its meaning the following rude diagram will perhaps render what i mean more intelligible it represents a bay in a district which has begun slowly rising before the movement commenced it is supposed that the waves had been enabled to eat into the land and form cliffs as far up but with gradually diminishing power as the points a a after the movement had commenced and gone on for a little time the sea is supposed still to have retained the power at the exposed mouth of the bay of cutting down and into the land as it slowly emerged but in the upper parts of the bay it is supposed soon to have lost this power owing to the more protected situation and to the quantity of detritus brought down by the river consequently low land was there accumulated as this low land was formed during a slow elevatory movement its surface will gently slope upwards from the beach on all sides now let us imagine the bay not to make the diagram more complicated suddenly converted into a valley the basal line of the cliffs will of course be horizontal as far as the beach is now seen extending in the diagram but in the upper part of the valley this line will be higher the level of the district having been raised whilst the low land was accumulating at the foot of the inland cliffs if instead of the bay in the diagram being suddenly converted into a valley we suppose with much more probability it to be upraised slowly then the waves in the upper parts of the bay will continue very gradually to fail to reach the cliffs which are now in the diagram represented as washed by the sea and which consequently will be left standing higher and higher above its leve whilst at the still exposed mouth it might well happen that the waves might be enabled to cut deeper and deeper both down and into the cliffs as the land slowly rose the greater or lesser destroying power of the waves at the mouths of successive bays comparatively with this same power in their upper and protected parts will vary as the bays become changed in form and size and therefore at different levels at their mouths and heads more or less of the surfaces between the escarpments that is the accumulated beachlines or terraces will be left undestroyed from what has gone before we can see that according as the elevatory movements after each cessation recommence more or less slowly according to the amount of detritus delivered by the river at the heads of the successive bays and according to the degree of protection afforded by their altered forms so will a greater or less extent of terrace be accumulated in the upper part to which there will be no surface at a corresponding level at the mouth hence we can perceive why no one terrace taken in its whole breadth and followed up the valley is horizontal though each separate beachline must have been so and why the inclination of the several terraces both transversely and longitudinally up the valley is not alike i have entered into this case in some detail for i was long perplexed and others have felt the same difficulty in understanding how on the idea of an equable elevation with the sea at intervals eating into the land it came that neither the terraces nor the upper nor lower edges of the escarpments were horizontal along lines of coast even of great lengths such as that of patagonia if they are nearly uniformly exposed the corroding power of the waves will be checked and conquered by the elevatory movement as often as it recommences at about the same period and hence the terraces or accumulated beachlines will commence being formed at nearly the same levels at each succeeding period of rest they will also be eaten into at nearly the same rate and consequently there will be a much closer coincidence in their levels and inclinations than in the terraces and escarpments formed round bays with their different parts very differently exposed to the action of the sea it is only where the waves are enabled after a long lapse of time slowly to corrode hard rocks or to throw up owing to the supply of sediment being small and to the surface being steeply inclined a narrow beach or mound that we can expect as at glen roy in scotland a distinct line marking an old sealevel and which will be strictly horizontal if the subsequent elevatory movements have been so for in these cases no discernible effects will be produced except during the long intervening periods of rest whereas in the case of stepformed coasts such as those described in this and the preceding chapter the terraces themselves are accumulated during the slow elevatory process the accumulation commencing sooner in protected than in exposed situations and sooner where there is copious supply of detritus than where there is little on the other hand the steps or escarpments are formed during the stationary periods and are more deeply cut down and into the coastland in exposed than in protected situationsthe cutting action moreover being prolonged in the most exposed parts both during the beginning and ending if slow of the upward movement although in the foregoing discussion i have assumed the elevation to have been horizontal it may be suspected from the considerable seaward slope of the terraces both up the valley of s cruz and up that of coquimbo that the rising has been greater inland than nearer the coast there is reason to believe from the effects produced on the watercourse of a mill during the earthquake of in chile that the upheaval one mile inland was nearly double namely between five and seven feet to what it was on the pacific we know also from the admirable researches of m bravais that in scandinavia the ancient seabeaches gently slope from the interior mountainranges towards the coast and that they are not parallel one to the other showing that the proportional difference in the amount of elevation on the coast and in the interior varied at different periods coquimbo to guascoin this distance of ninety miles i found in almost every part marine shells up to a height of apparently from to feet the desert plain near choros is thus covered it is bounded by the escarpment of a higher plain consisting of palecoloured earthy calcareous stone like that of coquimbo with the same recent shells embedded in it in the valley of chañeral a similar bed occurs in which differently from that of coquimbo i observed many shells of the concholepas near guasco the same calcareous bed is likewise met with in the valley of guasco the stepformed terraces of gravel are displayed in a more striking manner than at any other point i followed the valley for thirtyseven miles as reckoned by the inhabitants from the coast to ballenar in nearly the whole of this distance five grand terraces running at corresponding heights on both sides of the broad valley are more conspicuous than the three best developed ones at coquimbo they give to the landscape the most singular and formal aspect and when the clouds hung low hiding the neighbouring mountains the valley resembled in the most striking manner that of santa cruz the whole thickness of these terraces or plains seems composed of gravel rather firmly aggregated together with occasional parting seams of clay the pebbles on the upper plain are often whitewashed with an albuminous substance as in patagonia near the coast i observed many seashells on the lower plains at freyrina twelve miles up the valley there are six terraces beside the bottomsurface of the valley the two lower ones are here only from to yards in width but higher up the valley they expand into plains the third terrace is generally narrow the fourth i saw only in one place but there it was distinct for the length of a mile the fifth is very broad the sixth is the summitplain which expands inland into a great basin not having a barometer with me i did not ascertain the height of these plains but they appeared considerably higher than those at coquimbo their width varies much sometimes being very broad and sometimes contracting into mere fringes of separate flattopped projections and then quite disappearing at the one spot where the fourth terrace was visible the whole six terraces were cut off for a short space by one single bold escarpment near ballenar thirtyseven miles from the mouth of the river the valley between the summitedges of the highest escarpment is several miles in width and the five terraces on both sides are broadly developed the highest cannot be less than feet above the bed of the river which itself must i conceive be some hundred feet above the sea a north and south section across the valley in this part is here represented on the northern side of the valley the summitplain of gravel a has two escarpments one facing the valley and the other a great basinlike plain b which stretches for several leagues northward this narrow plain a with the double escarpment evidently once formed a spit or promontory of gravel projecting into and dividing two great bays and subsequently was worn on both sides into steep cliffs whether the several escarpments in this valley were formed during the same stationary periods with those of coquimbo i will not pretend to conjecture but if so the intervening and subsequent elevatory movements must have been here much more energetic for these plains certainly stand at a much higher level than do those of coquimbo copiapofrom guasco to copiapo i followed the road near the foot of the cordillera and therefore saw no upraised remains at the mouth however of the valley of copiapo there is a plain estimated by meyen between fifty and seventy feet in height of which the upper part consists chiefly of gravel abounding with recent shells chiefly of the concholepas venus dombeyi and calyptræa trochiformis a little inland on a plain estimated by myself at nearly feet the upper stratum was formed of broken shells and sand cemented by white calcareous matter and abounding with embedded recent shells of which the mulinia byronensis and pecten purpuratus were the most numerous the lower plain stretches for some miles southward and for an unknown distance northward but not far up the valley its seaward face according to meyen is worn into caves above the level of the present beach the valley of copiapo is much less steeply inclined and less direct in its course than any other valley which i saw in chile and its bottom does not generally consist of gravel there are no stepformed terraces in it except at one spot near the mouth of the great lateral valley of the despoblado where there are only two one above the other lower down the valley in one place i observed that the solid rock had been cut into the shape of a beach and was smoothed over with shingle northward of copiapo in lat s the old voyager wafer found immense numbers of seashells some miles from the coast at cobija lat m dorbigny observed beds of gravel and broken shells containing ten species of recent shells he also found on projecting points of porphyry at a height of feet shells of concholepas chiton calyptræa fissurella and patella still attached to the spots on which they had lived m dorbigny argues from this fact that the elevation must have been great and sudden to me it appears far more probable that the movement was gradual with small starts as during the earthquakes of and by which whole beds of shells attached to the rocks were lifted above the subsequent reach of the waves m dorbigny also found rolled pebbles extending up the mountain to a height of at least feet at iquique lat s in a great accumulation of sand at a height estimated between and feet i observed many large seashells which i thought could not have been blown up by the wind to that height mr j h blake has lately described these shells he states that inland toward the mountains they form a compact uniform bed scarcely a trace of the original shells being discernible but as we approach the shore the forms become gradually more distinct till we meet with the living shells on the coast this interesting observation showing by the gradual decay of the shells how slowly and gradually the coast must have been uplifted we shall presently see fully confirmed at lima at arica lat m dorbigny found a great range of sanddunes fourteen leagues in length stretching towards tacna including recent shells and bones of cetacea and reaching up to a height of feet above the sea lieut freyer has given some more precise facts he states that the morro of arica is about feet high it is worn into obscure terraces on the bare rock of which he found balini and milleporæ adhering at the height of between twenty and thirty feet the shells and corals were in a quite fresh state but at fifty feet they were much abraded there were however traces of organic remains at greater heights on the road from tacna to arequipa between loquimbo and moquegua mr m hamilton found numerous recent seashells in sand at a considerable distance from the sea lima northward of arica i know nothing of the coast for about a space of five degrees of latitude but near callao the port of lima there is abundant and very curious evidence of the elevation of the land the island of san lorenzo is upwards of feet high the basset edges of the strata composing the lower part are worn into three obscure narrow sloping steps or ledges which can be seen only when standing on them they probably resemble those described by lieut freyer at arica the surface of the lower ledge which extends from a low cliff overhanging the sea to the foot of the next upper escarpment is covered by an enormous accumulation of recent shells the bed is level and in some parts more than two feet in thickness i traced it over a space of one mile in length and heard of it in other places the uppermost part is eightyfive feet by the barometer above highwater mark the shells are packed together but not stratified they are mingled with earth and stones and are generally covered by a few inches of detritus they rest on a mass of nearly angular fragments of the underlying sandstone sometimes cemented together by common salt i collected eighteen species of shells of all ages and sizes several of the univalves had evidently long lain dead at the bottom of the sea for their insides were incrusted with balani and serpulæ all according to mr g b sowerby are recent species these upraised shells appear to be nearly in the same proportional numberswith the exception of the crepidulæ being more numerouswith those on the existing beach the state of preservation of the different species differed much but most of them were much corroded brittle and bleached the upper and lower surfaces of the concholepas had generally quite scaled off some of the trochi and fissurellæ still partially retain their colours it is remarkable that these shells taken all together have fully as ancient an appearance although the extremely arid climate appears highly favourable for their preservation as those from feet at valparaiso and certainly a more ancient appearance than those from to feet from valparaiso and concepeion at which places i have seen grass and other vegetables actually growing out of the shells many of the univalves here at san lorenzo were filled and united together by pure salt probably left by the evaporation of the seaspray as the land slowly emerged on the highest parts of the ledge small fragments of the shells were mingled with and evidently in process of reduction into a yellowishwhite soft calcareous powder tasting strongly of salt and in some places as fine as prepared medicinal chalk fossil remains of human artin the midst of these shells on san lorenzo i found light corallines the horny ovulecases of mollusca roots of seaweed bones of birds the heads of indian corn and other vegetable matter a piece of woven rushes and another of nearly decayed cotton string i extracted these remains by digging a hole on a level spot and they had all indisputably been embedded with the shells i compared the plaited rush the cotton string and indian corn at the house of an antiquary with similar objects taken from the huacas or burialgrounds of the ancient peruvians and they were undistinguishable it should be observed that the peruvians used string only of cotton the small quantity of sand or gravel with the shells the absence of large stones the width and thickness of the bed and the time requisite for a ledge to be cut into the sandstone all show that these remains were not thrown high up by an earthquakewave on the other hand these facts together with the number of dead shells and of floating objects both marine and terrestrial both natural and human render it almost certain that they were accumulated on a true beach since upraised eightyfive feet and upraised this much since indian man inhabited peru the elevation may have been either by several small sudden starts or quite gradual in this latter case the unrolled shells having been thrown up during gales beyond the reach of the waves which afterwards broke on the slowly emerging land i have made these remarks chiefly because i was at first surprised at the complete difference in nature between this broad smooth upraised bed of shells and the present shinglebeach at the foot of the low sandstonecliffs but a beach formed when the sea is cutting into the land as is shown now to be the case by the low bare sandstonecliffs ought not to be compared with a beach accumulated on a gently inclined rocky surface at a period when the sea probable owing to the elevatory movement in process was not able to eat into the land with respect to the mass of nearly angular saltcemented fragments of sandstone which lie under the shells and which are so unlike the materials of an ordinary seabeach i think it probable after having seen the remarkable effects of the earthquake of in absolutely shattering as if by gunpowder the surface of the primary rocks near concepcion that a smooth bare surface of stone was left by the sea covered by the shelly mass and that afterwards when upraised it was superficially shattered by the severe shocks so often experienced here the very low land surrounding the town of callao is to the south joined by an obscure escarpment to a higher plain south of bella vista which stretches along the coast for a length of about eight miles this plain appears to the eye quite level but the seacliffs show that its height varies as far as i could estimate from to feet it is composed of thin sometimes waving beds of clay often of bright red and yellow colours of layers of impure sand and in one part with a great stratified mass of granitic pebbles these beds are capped by a remarkable mass varying from two to six feet in thickness of reddish loam or mud containing many scattered and broken fragments of recent marine shells sometimes though rarely single large round pebble more frequently short irregular layers of fine gravel and very many pieces of red coarse earthenware which from their curvatures must once have formed parts of large vessels the earthenware is of indian manufacture and i found exactly similar pieces accidentally included within the bricks of which the neighbouring ancient peruvian burialmounds are built these fragments abounded in such numbers in certain spots that it appeared as if waggonloads of earthenware had been smashed to pieces the broken seashells and pottery are strewed both on the surface and throughout the whole thickness of this upper loamy mass i found them wherever i examined the cliffs for a space of between two and three miles and for half a mile inland and there can be little doubt that this same bed extends with a smooth surface several miles further over the entire plain besides the little included irregular layers of small pebbles there are occasionally very obscure traces of stratification at one of the highest parts of the cliff estimated feet above the sea where a little ravine came down there were two sections at right angles to each other of the floor of a shed or building in both sections or faces two rows one over the other of large round stones could be distinctly seen they were packed close together on an artificial layer of sand two inches thick which had been placed on the natural claybeds the round stones were covered by three feet in thickness of the loam with broken seashells and pottery hence before this widely spreadout bed of loam was deposited it is certain that the plain was inhabited and it is probable from the broken vessels being so much more abundant in certain spots than in others and from the underlying clay being fitted for their manufacture that the kilns stood here the smoothness and wide extent of the plain the bulk of matter deposited and the obscure traces of stratification seem to indicate that the loam was deposited under water on the other hand the presence of seashells their broken state the pebbles of various sizes and the artificial floor of round stones almost prove that it must have originated in a rush of water from the sea over the land the height of the plain namely feet renders it improbable that an earthquakewave vast as some have here been could have broken over the surface at its present level but when the land stood eightyfive feet lower at the period when the shells were thrown up on the ledge at s lorenzo and when as we know man inhabited this district such an event might well have occurred and if we may further suppose that the plain was at that time converted into a temporary lake as actually occurred during the earthquakes of and in the case of the low land round callao owing to its being encircled by a high shinglebeach all the appearances above described will be perfectly explained i must add that at a lower level near the point where the present low land round callao joins the higher plain there are appearances of two distinct deposits both apparently formed by debacles in the upper one a horses tooth and a dogs jaw were embedded so that both must have been formed after the settlement of the spaniards according to acosta the earthquakewave of rose eightyfour feet the inhabitants of callao do not believe as far as i could ascertain that any change in level is now in progress the great fragments of brickwork which it is asserted can be seen at the bottom of the sea and which have been adduced as a proof of a late subsidence are as i am informed by mr gill a resident engineer loose fragments this is probable for i found on the beach and not near the remains of any building masses of brickwork three and four feet square which had been washed into their present places and smoothed over with shingle during the earthquake of the spit of land on which the ruins of old callao stand is so extremely low and narrow that it is improbable in the highest degree that a town should have been founded on it in its present state and i have lately heard that m tschudi has come to the conclusion from a comparison of old with modern charts that the coast both south and north of callao has subsided i have shown that the island of san lorenzo has been upraised eightyfive feet since the peruvians inhabited this country and whatever may have been the amount of recent subsidence by so much more must the elevation have exceeded the eightyfive feet in several places in this neighbourhood marks of seaaction have been observed ulloa gives a detailed account of such appearances at a point five leagues northward of callao mr cruikshank found near lima successive lines of seacliffs with rounded blocks at their bases at a height of feet above the present level of the sea on the decay of upraised seashellsi have stated that many of the shells on the lower inclined ledge or terrace of san lorenzo are corroded in a peculiar manner and that they have a much more ancient appearance than the same species at considerably greater heights on the coast of chile i have also stated that these shells in the upper part of the ledge at the height of eightyfive feet above the sea are falling and in some parts are quite changed into a fine soft saline calcareous powder the finest part of this powder has been analysed for me at the request of sir h de la beche by the kindness of mr trenham reeks of the museum of economic geology it consists of carbonate of lime in abundance of sulphate and muriate of lime and of muriate and sulphate of soda the carbonate of lime is obviously derived from the shells and common salt is so abundant in parts of the bed that as before remarked the univalves are often filled with it the sulphate of lime may have been derived as has probably the common salt from the evaporation of the seaspray during the emergence of the land for sulphate of lime is now copiously deposited from the spray on the shores of ascension the other saline bodies may perhaps have been partially thus derived but chiefly as i conclude from the following facts through a different means on most parts of the second ledge or old seabeach at a height of feet there is a layer of white powder of variable thickness as much in some parts as two inches lying on the angular saltcemented fragments of sandstone and under about four inches of earth which powder from its close resemblance in nature to the upper and most decayed parts of the shelly mass i can hardly doubt originally existed as a bed of shells now much collapsed and quite disintegrated i could not discover with the microscope a trace of organic structure in it but its chemical constituents according to mr reeks are the same as in the powder extracted from amongst the decaying shells on the lower ledge with the marked exception that the carbonate of lime is present in only very small quantity on the third and highest ledge i observed some of this powder in a similar position and likewise occasionally in small patches at considerably greater heights near the summit of the island at iquique where the whole face of the country is covered by a highly saliferous alluvium and where the climate is extremely dry we have seen that according to mr blake the shells which are perfect near the beach become in ascending gradually less and less perfect until scarcely a trace of their original structure can be discovered it is known that carbonate of lime and common salt left in a mass together and slightly moistened partially decompose each other now we have at san lorenzo and at iquique in the shells and salt packed together and occasionally moistened by the socalled peruvian dew the proper elements for this action we can thus understand the peculiar corroded appearance of the shells on san lorenzo and the great decrease of quantity in the carbonate of lime in the powder on the upper ledge there is however a great difficulty on this view for the resultant salts should be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime the latter is present but not the carbonate of soda hence i am led to the perhaps unauthorised conjecture which i shall hereafter have to refer to that the carbonate of soda by some unexplained means becomes converted into a sulphate if the above remarks be just we are led to the very unexpected conclusion that a dry climate by leaving the salt from the seaspray undissolved is much less favourable to the preservation of upraised shells than a humid climate however this may be it is interesting to know the manner in which masses of shells gradually upraised above the sealevel decay and finally disappear summary on the recent elevation of the west coast of south americawe have seen that upraised marine remains occur at intervals and in some parts almost continuously from lat to s along the shores of the pacific this is a distance in a north and south line of geographical miles from byrons observations the elevation has no doubt extended sixty miles farther south and from the similarity in the form of the country near lima it has probably extended many leagues farther north along this great line of coast besides the organic remains there are in very many parts marks of erosion caves ancient beaches sanddunes and successive terraces of gravel all above the present level of the sea from the steepness of the land on this side of the continent shells have rarely been found at greater distances inland than from two to three leagues but the marks of seaaction are evident farther from the coast for instance in the valley of guasco at a distance of between thirty and forty miles judging from the upraised shells alone the elevation in chiloe has been feet at concepcion certainly feet and by estimation feet at valparaiso feet at coquimbo feet northward of this place seashells have not i believe been found above feet and at lima they were falling into decay hastened probably by the salt at eightyfive feet not only has this amount of elevation taken place within the period of existing mollusca and cirripedes but their proportional numbers in the neighbouring sea have in most cases remained the same near lima however a small change in this respect between the living and the upraised was observed at coquimbo this was more evident all the shells being existing species but with those embedded in the uppermost calcareous plain not approximating so closely in proportional numbers as do those that lie loose on its surface at the height of feet and still less closely than those which are strewed on the lower plains which latter are identical in proportional numbers with those now cast up on the beach from this circumstance and from not finding upon careful examination near coquimbo any shells at a greater height than feet i believe that the recent elevation there has been much less than at valparaiso where it has been feet and i may add than at concepcion this considerable inequality in the amount of elevation at coquimbo and valparaiso places only miles apart is not improbable considering first the difference in the force and number of the shocks now yearly affecting different parts of this coast and secondly the fact of single areas such as that of the province of concepcion having been uplifted very unequally during the same earthquake it would in most cases be very hazardous to infer an inequality of elevation from shells being found on the surface or in superficial beds at different heights for we do not know on what their rate of decay depends and at coquimbo one instance out of many has been given of a promontory which from the occurrence of one very small collection of limecemented shells has indisputably been elevated feet and yet on which not even a fragment of shell could be found on careful examination between this height and the beach although many sites appeared very favourable for the preservation of organic remains the absence also of shells on the gravelterraces a short distance up the valley of coquimbo though abundant on the corresponding terraces at its mouth should be borne in mind there are other epochs besides that of the existence of recent mollusca by which to judge of the changes of level on this coast at lima as we have just seen the elevation has been at least eightyfive feet within the indohuman period and since the arrival of the spaniards in there has apparently been a sinking of the surface at valparaiso in the course of years the rise must have been less than nineteen feet but it has been as much as from ten to eleven feet in the seventeen years subsequently to and of this rise only a part can be attributed to the earthquake of the remainder having been insensible and apparently still in in progress at chiloe the elevation has been gradual and about four feet during four years at coquimbo also it has been gradual and in the course of years has amounted to several feet the sudden small upheavals accompanied by earthquakes as in at valparaiso in at concepcion and in in the chonos archipelago are familiar to most geologists but the gradual rising of the coast of chile has been hardly noticed it is however very important as connecting together these two orders of events the rise of lima having been eightyfive feet within the period of man is the more surprising if we refer to the eastern coast of the continent for at port s julian in patagonia there is good evidence as we shall hereafter see that when the land stood ninety feet lower the macrauchenia a mammiferous beast was alive and at bahia blanca when it stood only a few feet lower than it now does many gigantic quadrupeds ranged over the adjoining country but the coast of patagonia is some way distant from the cordillera and the movement at bahia blanca is perhaps no ways connected with this great range but rather with the tertiary volcanic rocks of banda oriental and therefore the elevation at these places may have been infinitely slower than on the coast of peru all such speculations however must be vague for as we know with certainty that the elevation of the whole coast of patagonia has been interrupted by many and long pauses who will pretend to say that in such cases many and long periods of subsidence may not also have been intercalated in many parts of the coast of chile and peru there are marks of the action of the sea at successive heights on the land showing that the elevation has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest in the upward movement and of denudation in the action of the sea these are plainest at chiloe where in a height of about feet there are three escarpmentsat coquimbo where in a height of feet there are fiveat guasco where there are six of which five may perhaps correspond with those at coquimbo but if so the subsequent and intervening elevatory movements have been here much more energeticat lima where in a height of about feet there are three terraces and others as it is asserted at considerably greater heights the almost entire absence of ancient marks of seaaction at defined levels along considerable spaces of coast as near valparaiso and concepcion is highly instructive for as it is improbable that the elevation at these places alone should have been continuous we must attribute the absence of such marks to the nature and form of the coastrocks seeing over how many hundred miles of the coast of patagonia and on how many places on the shores of the pacific the elevatory process has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest we may conclude conjointly with the evidence drawn from other quarters of the world that the elevation of the land is generally an intermittent action from the quantity of matter removed in the formation of the escarpments especially of those of patagonia it appears that the periods of rest in the movement and of denudation of the land have generally been very long in patagonia we have seen that the elevation has been equable and the periods of denudation synchronous over very wide spaces of coast on the shores of the pacific owing to the terraces chiefly occurring in the valleys we have not equal means of judging on this point and the very different heights of the upraised shells at coquimbo valparaiso and concepcion seem directly opposed to such a conclusion whether on this side of the continent the elevation between the periods of comparative rest when the escarpments were formed has been by small sudden starts such as those accompanying recent earthquakes or as is most probable by such starts conjointly with a gradual upward movement or by great and sudden upheavals i have no direct evidence but as on the eastern coast i was led to think from the analogy of the last hundred feet of elevation in la plata and from the nearly equal size of the pebbles over the entire width of the terraces and from the upraised shells being all littoral species that the elevation had been gradual so do i on this western coast from the analogy of the movements now in progress and from the vast numbers of shells now living exclusively on or close to the beach which are strewed over the whole surface of the land up to very considerable heights conclude that the movement here also has been slow and gradual aided probably by small occasional starts we know at least that at coquimbo where five escarpments occur in a height of feet that the successive elevations if they have been sudden cannot have been very great it has i think been shown that the occasional preservation of shells unrolled and unbroken is not improbable even during a quite gradual rising of the land and their preservation if the movement has been aided by small starts is quite conformable with what actually takes place during recent earthquakes judging from the present action of the sea along the shores of the pacific on the deposits of its own accumulation the present time seems in most places to be one of comparative rest in the elevatory movement and of denudation of the land undoubtedly this is the case along the whole great length of patagonia at chiloe however we have seen that a narrow sloping fringe covered with vegetation separates the present seabeach from a line of low cliffs which the waves lately reached here then the land is gaining in breadth and height and the present period is not one of rest in the elevation and of contingent denudation but if the rising be not prolonged at a quick rate there is every probability that the sea will soon regain its former horizontal limits i observed similar low sloping fringes on several parts of the coast both northward of valparaiso and near coquimbo but at this latter place from the change in form which the coast has undergone since the old escarpments were worn it may be doubted whether the sea acting for any length of time at its present level would eat into the land for it now rather tends to throw up great masses of sand it is from facts such as these that i have generally used the term comparative rest as applied to the elevation of the land the rest or cessation in the movement being comparative both with what has preceded it and followed it and with the seas power of corrosion at each spot and at each level near lima the cliffformed shores of san lorenzo and on the mainland south of callao show that the sea is gaining on the land and as we have here some evidence that its surface has lately subsided or is still sinking the periods of comparative rest in the elevation and of contingent denudation may probably in many cases include periods of subsidence it is only as was shown in detail when discussing the terraces of coquimbo when the sea with difficulty and after a long lapse of time has either corroded a narrow ledge into solid rock or has heaped up on a steep surface a narrow mound of detritus that we can confidently assert that the land at that level and at that period long remained absolutely stationary in the case of terraces formed of gravel or sand although the elevation may have been strictly horizontal it may well happen that no one level beachline may be traceable and that neither the terraces themselves nor the summit nor basal edges of their escarpments may be horizontal finally comparing the extent of the elevated area as deduced from the upraised recent organic remains on the two sides of the continent we have seen that on the atlantic shells have been found at intervals from eastern tierra del fuego for miles northward and on the pacific for a space of miles for a length of miles they occur in the same latitudes on both sides of the continent without taking this circumstance into consideration it is probable from the reasons assigned in the last chapter that the entire breadth of the continent in central patagonia has been uplifted in mass but from other reasons there given it would be hazardous to extend this conclusion to la plata from the continent being narrow in the southernmost parts of patagonia and from the shells found at the inner narrows of the strait of magellan and likewise far up the valley of the s cruz it is probable that the southern part of the western coast which was not visited by me has been elevated within the period of recent mollusca if so the shores of the pacific have been continuously recently and in a geological sense synchronously upraised from lima for a height of nautical miles southwarda distance equal to that from the red sea to the north

its origin the space between the cordillera and the coast of chile is on a rude average from eighty to above one hundred miles in width it is formed either of an almost continuous mass of mountains or more commonly of several nearly parallel ranges separated by plains in the more southern parts of this province the mountains are quite subordinate to the plains in the northern part the mountains predominate the basinlike plains at the foot of the cordillera are in several respects remarkable that on which the capital of chile stands is fifteen miles in width in an east and west line and of much greater length in a north and south line it stands feet above the sea its surface appears smooth but really falls and rises in wide gentle undulations the hollows corresponding with the main valleys of the cordillera the striking manner in which it abruptly comes up to the foot of this great range has been remarked by every author since the time of molina near the cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass of pebbles of all sizes occasionally including rounded boulders near its western boundary it consists of reddish sandy clay containing some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice and sometimes passes into pure sand or into volcanic ashes at podaguel on this western side of the plain beds of sand are capped by a calcareous tuff the uppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic and the lower ones white and friable both together precisely resembling the beds at coquimbo which contain recent marine shells abrupt but rounded hummocks of rock rise out of this plain those of sta lucia and s cristoval are formed of greenstoneporphyry almost entirely denuded of its original covering of porphyritic claystone breccia on their summits many fragments of rock some of them kinds not found in situ are coated and united together by a white friable calcareous tuff like that found at podaguel when this matter was deposited on the summit of s cristoval the water must have stood feet above the surface of the surrounding plain to the south this basinlike plain contracts and rising scarcely perceptibly with a smooth surface passes through a remarkable level gap in the mountains forming a true landstrait and called the angostura it then immediately expands into a second basinformed plain this again to the south contracts into another landstrait and expands into a third basin which however falls suddenly in level about forty feet this third basin to the south likewise contracts into a strait and then again opens into the great plain of s fernando stretching so far south that the snowy peaks of the distant cordillera are seen rising above its horizon as above the sea these plains near the cordillera are generally formed of a thick stratified mass of shingle in other parts of a red sandy clay often with an admixture of pumiceous matter although these basins are connected together like a necklace in a north and south line by smooth landstraits the streams which drain them do not all flow north and south but mostly westward through breaches worn in the bounding mountains and in the case of the second basin or that of rancagua there are two distinct breaches each basin moreover is not drained singly thus to give the most striking instance but not the only one in proceeding southward over the plain of rancagua we first find the water flowing northward to and through the northern landstrait then without crossing any marked ridge or watershed we see it flowing southwestward towards the northern one of the two breaches in the western mountainous boundary and lastly again without any ridge it flows towards the southern breach in these same mountains hence the surface of this one basinlike plain appearing to the eye so level has been modelled with great nicety so that the drainage without any conspicuous watersheds is directed towards three openings in the encircling mountains the streams flowing from the three southern basinlike plains after passing through the breaches to the west unite and form the river rapel which enters the pacific near navidad i followed the southernmost branch of this river and found that the basin or plain of s fernando is continuously and smoothly united with those plains which were described in the ninth chapter as being worn near the coast into successive caveeaten escarpments and still nearer to the coast as being strewed with upraised recent marine remains i might have given descriptions of numerous other plains of the same general form some at the foot of the cordillera some near the coast and some halfway between these points i will alude only to one other namely the plain of uspallata lying on the eastern or opposite side of the cordillera between that great range and the parallel lower range of uspallata
