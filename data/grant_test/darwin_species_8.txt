in themselves not very wonderful this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hivebee we must suppose the melipona to make her cells truly spherical and of equal sizes and this would not be very surprising seeing that she already does so to a certain extent and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can make apparently by turning round on a fixed point we must suppose the melipona to arrange her cells in level layers as she already does her cylindrical cells and we must further suppose and this is the greatest difficulty that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellowlabourers when several are making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces we have further to suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey in the same way as the rude humblebee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons by such modifications of instincts in themselves not very wonderfulhardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nesti believe that the hivebee has acquired through natural selection her inimitable architectural powers but this theory can be tested by experiment following the example of mr tegetmeier i separated two combs and put between them a long thick square strip of wax the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it and as they deepened these little pits they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere and of about the diameter of a cell it was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width ie about the width of an ordinary cell and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other as soon as this occurred the bees ceased to excavate and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a threesided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells i then put into the hive instead of a thick square piece of wax a thin and narrow knifeedged ridge coloured with vermilion the bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other in the same way as before but the ridge of wax was so thin that the bottoms of the basins if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment would have broken into each other from the opposite sides the bees however did not suffer this to happen and they stopped their excavations in due time so that the basins as soon as they had been a little deepened came to have flat bottoms and these flat bottoms formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed were situated as far as the eye could judge exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax in parts only little bits in other parts large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins but the work from the unnatural state of things had not been neatly performed the bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection considering how flexible thin wax is i do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness and then stopping their work in ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides for i have noticed halfcompleted rhombs at the base of a justcommenced cell which were slightly concave on one side where i suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly in one wellmarked instance i put the comb back into the hive and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time and again examined the cell and i found that the rhombic plate had been completed and had become perfectly flat it was absolutely impossible from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic plate that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side and i suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax which as i have tried is easily done into its proper intermediate plane and thus flatten it from the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can clearly see that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax they could make their cells of the proper shape by standing at the proper distance from each other by excavating at the same rate and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows but never allowing the spheres to break into each other now bees as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb do make a rough circumferential wall or rim all round the comb and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides always working circularly as they deepen each cell they do not make the whole threesided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin or the two plates as the case may be and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates until the hexagonal walls are commenced some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder huber but i am convinced of their accuracy and if i had space i could show that they are conformable with my theory hubers statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallelsided wall of wax is not as far as i have seen strictly correct the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax but i will not here enter on these details we see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper positionthat is along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres i have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb flexures may sometimes be observed corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells but the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off by being largely gnawed away on both sides the manner in which the bees build is curious they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell which will ultimately be left we shall understand how they work by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground till a smooth very thin wall is left in the middle the masons always piling up the cutaway cement and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge we shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping from all the cells both those just commenced and those completed being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls which are only about one fourhundredth of an inch in thickness the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick by this singular manner of building strength is continually given to the comb with the utmost ultimate economy of wax it seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made that a multitude of bees all work together one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another so that as huber has stated a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell i was able practically to show this fact by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax and i invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the beesas delicately as a painter could have done with his brushby atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round the work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other all trying to sweep equal spheres and then building up or leaving ungnawed the planes of intersection between these spheres it was really curious to note in cases of difficulty as when two pieces of comb met at an angle how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected when bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for workingfor instance on a slip of wood placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slipin this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon in its strictly proper place projecting beyond the other completed cells it suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells and then by striking imaginary spheres they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres but as far as i have seen they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built this capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two justcommenced cells is important as it bears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of waspcombs are sometimes strictly hexagonal but i have not space here to enter on this subject nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect as in the case of a queenwasp making hexagonal cells if she work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun sweeping spheres or cylinders and building up intermediate planes it is even conceivable that an insect might by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell and then moving outside first to one point and then to five other points at the proper relative distances from the central point and from each other strike the planes of intersection and so make an isolated hexagon but i am not aware that any such case has been observed nor would any good be derived from a single hexagon being built as in its construction more materials would be required than for a cylinder as natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life it may reasonably be asked how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction could have profited the progenitors of the hivebee i think the answer is not difficult it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar and i am informed by mr tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs moreover many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion a large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies or on quite distinct causes and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect but let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined as it probably often does determine the numbers of a humblebee which could exist in a country and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter and consequently required a store of honey there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humblebee if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together so as to intersect a little for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humblebee if she were to make her cells more and more regular nearer together and aggregated into a mass like the cells of the melipona for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells and much wax would be saved again from the same cause it would be advantageous to the melipona if she were to make her cells closer together and more regular in every way than at present for then as we have seen the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and would all be replaced by plane surfaces and the melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hivebee beyond this stage of perfection in architecture natural selection could not lead for the comb of the hivebee as far as we can see is absolutely perfect in economising wax thus as i believe the most wonderful of all known instincts that of the hivebee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection the bees of course no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates the motive power of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax that individual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new swarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence no doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selectioncases in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated cases in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist cases of instinct of apparently such trifling importance that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent and must therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection i will not here enter on these several cases but will confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually fatal to my whole theory i allude to the neuters or sterile females in insectcommunities for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females and yet from being sterile they cannot propagate their kind the subject well deserves to be discussed at great length but i will here take only a single case that of working or sterile ants how the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile and if such insects had been social and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work but incapable of procreation i can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection but i must pass over this preliminary difficulty the great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes and in instinct as far as instinct alone is concerned the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been far better exemplified by the hivebee if a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state i should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection namely by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure this being inherited by its offspring which again varied and were again selected and so onwards but with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents yet absolutely sterile so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny it may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection first let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature of all sorts of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages and to either sex we have differences correlated not only to one sex but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is active as in the nuptial plumage of many birds and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon we have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds hence i can see no real difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insectcommunities the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection this difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as i believe disappears when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family as well as to the individual and may thus gain the desired end thus a wellflavoured vegetable is cooked and the individual is destroyed but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together the animal has been slaughtered but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family i have such faith in the powers of selection that i do not doubt that a breed of cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows when matched produced oxen with the longest horns and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind thus i believe it has been with social insects a slight modification of structure or instinct correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community has been advantageous to the community consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification and i believe that this process has been repeated until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see in many social insects but we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty namely the fact that the neuters of several ants differ not only from the fertile females and males but from each other sometimes to an almost incredible degree and are thus divided into two or even three castes the castes moreover do not generally graduate into each other but are perfectly well defined being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the same genus or rather as any two genera of the same family thus in eciton there are working and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different in cryptocerus the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads the use of which is quite unknown in the mexican myrmecocystus the workers of one caste never leave the nest they are fed by the workers of another caste and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides or the domestic cattle as they may be called which our european ants guard or imprison it will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection when i do not admit that such wonderful and wellestablished facts at once annihilate my theory in the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind which have been rendered by natural selection as i believe to be quite possible different from the fertile males and femalesin this case we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations that each successive slight profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest but in a few alone and that by the longcontinued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired character on this view we ought occasionally to find neuterinsects of the same species in the same nest presenting gradations of structure and this we do find even often considering how few neuterinsects out of europe have been carefully examined mr f smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters of several british ants differ from each other in size and sometimes in colour and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest i have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind it often happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous or that both large and small are numerous with those of an intermediate size scanty in numbers formica flava has larger and smaller workers with some of intermediate size and in this species as mr f smith has observed the larger workers have simple eyes ocelli which though small can be plainly distinguished whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size and i fully believe though i dare not assert so positively that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition so that we here have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest differing not only in size but in their organs of vision yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition i may digress by adding that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community and those males and females had been continually selected which produced more and more of the smaller workers until all the workers had come to be in this condition we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of myrmica for the workers of myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli though the male and female ants of this genus have welldeveloped ocelli i may give one other case so confidently did i expect to find gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species that i gladly availed myself of mr f smiths offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant anomma of west africa the reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers by my giving not the actual measurements but a strictly accurate illustration the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high and many sixteen feet high but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men and jaws nearly five times as big the jaws moreover of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape and in the form and number of the teeth but the important fact for us is that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes yet they graduate insensibly into each other as does the widelydifferent structure of their jaws i speak confidently on this latter point as mr lubbock made drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had dissected from the workers of the several sizes with these facts before me i believe that natural selection by acting on the fertile parents could form a species which should regularly produce neuters either all of large size with one form of jaw or all of small size with jaws having a widely different structure or lastly and this is our climax of difficulty one set of workers of one size and structure and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structurea graduated series having been first formed as in the case of the driver ant and then the extreme forms from being the most useful to the community having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated them until none with an intermediate structure were produced thus as i believe the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest both widely different from each other and from their parents has originated we can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of insects on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man as ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments a perfect division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile for had they been fertile they would have intercrossed and their instincts and structure would have become blended and nature has as i believe effected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants by the means of natural selection but i am bound to confess that with all my faith in this principle i should never have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so high a degree had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me of the fact i have therefore discussed this case at some little but wholly insufficient length in order to show the power of natural selection and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has encountered the case also is very interesting as it proves that with animals as with plants any amount of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of numerous slight and as we must call them accidental variations which are in any manner profitable without exercise or habit having come into play for no amount of exercise or habit or volition in the utterly sterile members of a community could possibly have affected the structure or instincts of the fertile members which alone leave descendants i am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects against the wellknown doctrine of lamarck summaryi have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations are inherited still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature no one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal therefore i can see no difficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selection accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent in any useful direction in some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play i do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any great degree my theory but none of the cases of difficulty to the best of my judgment annihilate it on the other hand the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakesthat no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of other animals but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of othersthat the canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views but is otherwise inexplicableall tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection this theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts as by that common case of closely allied but certainly distinct species when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life yet often retaining nearly the same instincts for instance we can understand on the principle of inheritance how it is that the thrush of south america lines its nest with mud in the same peculiar manner as does our british thrush how it is that the male wrens troglodytes of north america build cocknests to roost in like the males of our distinct kittywrensa habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird finally it may not be a logical deduction but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its fosterbrothersants making slavesthe larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillarsnot as specially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die chapter viii hybridism distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids sterility various in degree not universal affected by close interbreeding removed by domestication laws governing the sterility of hybrids sterility not a special endowment but incidental on other differences causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility summary the view generally entertained by naturalists is that species when intercrossed have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms this view certainly seems at first probable for species within the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely the importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile has i think been much underrated by some late writers on the theory of natural selection the case is especially important inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility i hope however to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality but is incidental on other acquired differences in treating this subject two classes of facts to a large extent fundamentally different have generally been confounded together namely the sterility of two species when first crossed and the sterility of the hybrids produced from them pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect condition yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring hybrids on the other hand have their reproductive organs functionally impotent as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals though the organs themselves are perfect in structure as far as the microscope reveals in the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect in the second case they are either not at all developed or are imperfectly developed this distinction is important when the cause of the sterility which is common to the two cases has to be considered the distinction has probably been slurred over owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment beyond the province of our reasoning powers the fertility of varieties that is of the forms known or believed to have descended from common parents when intercrossed and likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring is on my theory of equal importance with the sterility of species for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species first for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers kölreuter and gärtner who almost devoted their lives to this subject without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility kölreuter makes the rule universal but then he cuts the knot for in ten cases in which he found two forms considered by most authors as distinct species quite fertile together he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties gärtner also makes the rule equally universal and he disputes the entire fertility of kölreuters ten cases but in these and in many other cases gärtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds in order to show that there is any degree of sterility he always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring with the average number produced by both pure parentspecies in a state of nature but a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced a plant to be hybridised must be castrated and what is often more important must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants nearly all the plants experimentised on by gärtner were potted and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house that these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted for gärtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated and artificially fertilised with their own pollen and excluding all cases such as the leguminosæ in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired moreover as gärtner during several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip which we have such good reason to believe to be varieties and only once or twice succeeded in getting fertile seed as he found the common red and blue pimpernels anagallis arvensis and cœrulea which the best botanists rank as varieties absolutely sterile together and as he came to the same concluson in several other analogous cases it seems to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so sterile when intercrossed as gärtner believes it is certain on the one hand that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly and on the other hand that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins i think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived namely kölreuter and gärtner should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species it is also most instructive to comparebut i have not space here to enter on detailsthe evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers or by the same author from experiments made during different years it can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties but that the evidence from this source graduates away and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences in regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations though gärtner was enabled to rear some hybrids carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent for six or seven and in one case for ten generations yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased but generally greatly decreased i do not doubt that this is usually the case and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations nevertheless i believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause namely from close interbreeding i have collected so large a body of facts showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility and on the other hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility that i cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers and as the parentspecies or other allied hybrids generally grow in the same garden the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen and i am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility already lessened by their hybrid origin i am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by gärtner namely that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind their fertility notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation sometimes decidedly increases and goes on increasing now in artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance as i know from my own experience from the anthers of another flower as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised so that a cross between two flowers though probably on the same plant would be thus effected moreover whenever complicated experiments are in progress so careful an observer as gärtner would have castrated his hybrids and this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from a distinct flower either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature and thus the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may i believe be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced hybridiser namely the hon and rev w herbert he is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertileas fertile as the pure parentspeciesas are kölreuter and gärtner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature he experimentised on some of the very same species as did gärtner the difference in their results may i think be in part accounted for by herberts great horticultural skill and by his having hothouses at his command of his many important statements i will here give only a single one as an example namely that every ovule in a pod of crinum capense fertilised by c revolutum produced a plant which he says i never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation so that we here have perfect or even more than commonly perfect fertility in a first cross between two distinct species this case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact namely that there are individual plants as with certain species of lobelia and with all the species of the genus hippeastrum which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct species than by their own pollen for these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species though quite sterile with their own pollen notwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good for it fertilised distinct species so that certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be selffertilised for instance a bulb of hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers three were fertilised by herbert with their own pollen and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct species the result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely in a letter to me in mr herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment during five years and he continued to try it during several subsequent years and always with the same result this result has also been confirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with its subgenera and in the case of some other genera as lobelia passiflora and verbascum although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect to other species yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual selfaction we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed in comparison with the same species when selffertilised sometimes depends the practical experiments of horticulturists though not made with scientific precision deserve some notice it is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of pelargonium fuchsia calceolaria petunia rhododendron c have been crossed yet many of these hybrids seed freely for instance herbert asserts that a hybrid from calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea species most widely dissimilar in general habit reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of chile i have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of rhododendrons and i am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile mr c noble for instance informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between rhod ponticum and catawbiense and that this hybrid seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine had hybrids when fairly treated gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation as gärtner believes to be the case the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids and such alone are fairly treated for by insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insectagency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons which produce no pollen for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers in regard to animals much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants if our systematic arrangements can be trusted that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the genera of plants then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants but the hybrids themselves are i think more sterile i doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated it should however be borne in mind that owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement few experiments have been fairly tried for instance the canarybird has been crossed with nine other finches but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary or that their hybrids should be perfectly fertile again with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals i hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding on the contrary brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder and in this case it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing if we were to act thus and pair brothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal which from any cause had the least tendency to sterility the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few generations although i do not know of any thoroughly wellauthenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals i have some reason to believe that the hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii and from phasianus colchicus with p torquatus and with p versicolor are perfectly fertile the hybrids from the common and chinese geese a cygnoides species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera have often bred in this country with either pure parent and in one single instance they have bred inter se this was effected by mr eyton who raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids grandchildren of the pure geese from one nest in india however these crossbred geese must be far more fertile for i am assured by two eminently capable judges namely mr blyth and capt hutton that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country and as they are kept for profit where neither pure parentspecies exists they must certainly be highly fertile a doctrine which originated with pallas has been largely accepted by modern naturalists namely that most of our domestic animals have descended from two or more aboriginal species since commingled by intercrossing on this view the aboriginal species must either at first have produced quite fertile hybrids or the hybrids must have become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication this latter alternative seems to me the most probable and i am inclined to believe in its truth although it rests on no direct evidence i believe for instance that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks yet with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of south america all are quite fertile together and analogy makes me greatly doubt whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids so again there is reason to believe that our european and the humped indian cattle are quite fertile together but from facts communicated to me by mr blyth i think they must be considered as distinct species on this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed or we must look at sterility not as an indelible characteristic but as one capable of being removed by domestication finally looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals it may be concluded that some degree of sterility both in first crosses and in hybrids is an extremely general result but that it cannot under our present state of knowledge be considered as absolutely universal laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybridswe will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids our chief object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed with this quality in order to prevent their crossing and blending together in utter confusion the following rules and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from gärtners admirable work on the hybridisation of plants i have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals i have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms it has been already remarked that the degree of fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids graduates from zero to perfect fertility it is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given when pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust from this absolute zero of fertility the pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility and as we have seen in certain abnormal cases even to an excess of fertility beyond that which the plants own pollen will produce so in hybrids themselves there are some which never have produced and probably never would produce even with the pollen of either pure parent a single fertile seed but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected by the pollen of one of the pure parentspecies causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation from this extreme degree of sterility we have selffertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross and which rarely produce any offspring are generally very sterile but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross and the sterility of the hybrids thus producedtwo classes of facts which are generally confounded togetheris by no means strict there are many cases in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility and produce numerous hybridoffspring yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile on the other hand there are species which can be crossed very rarely or with extreme difficulty but the hybrids when at last produced are very fertile even within the limits of the same genus for instance in dianthus these two opposite cases occur the fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids is more easily affected by unfavourable conditions than is the fertility of pure species but the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment so it is with hybrids for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions by the term systematic affinity is meant the resemblance between species in structure and in constitution more especially in the structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the allied species now the fertility of first crosses between species and of the hybrids produced from them is largely governed by their systematic affinity this is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families and on the other hand by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility but the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict a multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite or only with extreme difficulty and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility in the same family there may be a genus as dianthus in which very many species can most readily be crossed and another genus as silene in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid even within the limits of the same genus we meet with this same difference for instance the many species of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus but gärtner found that n acuminata which is not a particularly distinct species obstinately failed to fertilise or to be fertilised by no less than eight other species of nicotiana very many analogous facts could be given no one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species crossing it can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance and having strongly marked differences in every part of the flower even in the pollen in the fruit and in the cotyledons can be crossed annual and perennial plants deciduous and evergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates can often be crossed with ease by a reciprocal cross between two species i mean the case for instance of a stallionhorse being first crossed with a femaleass and then a maleass with a mare these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed there is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses such cases are highly important for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity or of any recognisable difference in their whole organisation on the other hand these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences imperceptible by us and confined to the reproductive system this difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by kölreuter to give an instance mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of m longiflora and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile but kölreuter tried more than two hundred times during eight following years to fertilise reciprocally m longiflora with the pollen of m jalappa and utterly failed several other equally striking cases could be given thuret has observed the same fact with certain seaweeds or fuci gärtner moreover found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree he has observed it even between forms so closely related as matthiola annua and glabra that many botanists rank them only as varieties it is also a remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses though of course compounded of the very same two species the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother generally differ in fertility in a small and occasionally in a high degree several other singular rules could be given from gärtner for instance some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together there are certain hybrids which instead of having as is usual an intermediate character between their two parents always closely resemble one of them and such hybrids though externally so like one of their pure parentspecies are with rare exceptions extremely sterile so again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born which closely resemble one of their pure parents and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility these facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent considering the several rules now given which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids we see that when forms which must be considered as good and distinct species are united their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess that their fertility besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions is innately variable that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent and lastly that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other this latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species for according as the one species or the other is
