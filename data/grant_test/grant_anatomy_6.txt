fig a there are eight muscular long feet provided with large sessile suckers as in other octopods the ventral or anterior sur face of the body is directed towards the concave or spiral side of the shell as in the planorbis and other mollusca with orbicular shells and the dorsal part of the animal with the expanded pair of membranous feet are placed next to the convex outer margin of the shell a the mantle is spotted externally as in the naked cephalopods and is des titute of muscular fins as seen in fig b which repre sents the animal removed from the shell the shell cover ing a part of the body has been observed by poli in the ovum as represented in fig c a the muscular por tion of the posterior pair of feet fig b gj and the gradually diminishing sessile suckers are continued around the margin of the expanded membranous part fig a h so that this pair of feet may be employed as organs of pre hension or for creeping at the bottom or for swimming beneath or above the surface of the water here as in the naked cephalopods there is a thin panniculus carnosus immediately beneath the coloured skin of the mantle the fibres of which interlace to form a thin recticulate tunic the parietes of the mantle are chiefly composed of longitu dinal muscular fibres with a thin external and transverse layer the external and internal muscles of the abdominal fins in the naked species both those which connect these organs with the trunk and those which move their free mar gins are inserted into two thin longitudinal cartilaginous scapular plates the palleal muscles are not inserted into the shell of the argonaute nor into the internal dorsal shells of the naked cephalopods as they are in the nautilus the upper margin of the mantle is attached behind to the cepha lic cartilage in the sepiola and the octopus but is free in sepia loligo and loligopsis the cavity of the abdomen is partially divided by two strong and broad muscular bands extending downwards and forwards from the base of the funnel to be attached to the anterior parietes of the sac these two strong longitudinal muscular columns between which the rectum passes forwards to the base of the syphon serve to contract longitudinally the cavity of the mantle to limit the extent of its dilatations and to retract the funnel there are other muscular bands passing down from the back part of the head to the base of the funnel at its posterior part the folds of peritoneum which attach the branchiae to the sides of the abdominal cavity have distinct muscular fasciculi for raising and retracting these organs the whole muscular parietes of the abdominal sac are firm white arid remark ably compact and besides their transverse and longitudinal muscular layers there are oblique and straight short fibres which pass through their thickness from one surface to the other within the abdominal cavity a distinct muscular tunic embraces the whole liver and oesophagus as far as the gizzard and connects them with the upper and back part of the trunk the strongest and the largest muscles of the naked cephalopods are those which are attached around the head connecting that part with the trunk behind and with the arms before strong muscular bands pass upwards from the back and fore parts of the trunk and expand into radiat ing fasciculi which enter into the bases of the feet the funnel consists chiefly of two strata of muscular fibres the inner of which is transverse and the outer longitudinal in the annexed front view of the muscles of the argonaute fig the funnel e is folded down over the fore part of the abdomen and its strong posterior muscular bands d d are seen passing down wards from its base the anterior ascending radiating fasciculi a cross each other at the bases of the feet so as to interlace and mingle their fibres before they enter into the compo sition of these organs these muscular fibres are more straight and parallel as they advance along the feet b en veloping the trunks of the vessels and nerves which are seen ramifying on the ex panded terminal membrane c of the posterior pair of feet the suckers in two rows as on the other feet continue around the margin of these expanded terminations of the posterior pair all the naked cephalopods are octopods like this testaceous argonaute having only eight feet developed from the muscular disk surrounding the mouth but many of the genera as sepia loligo and sepiola have also two long muscular tentacula which have a deeper origin near the car tilaginous orbits and from these superadded pediform tenta cula such genera have been considered as decapods the rudimentary eyelids of the naked cephalopods are already surrounded with distinct orbicular muscles and the eye balls are moved by four recti muscles and sometimes by an inferior oblique arising from the base of the orbits around the optic nerves the tentacula have generally pedunculated muscular suckers developed on their inferior surface at their free extremities like those of the feet in the tentaculated species of this class the muscular suckers are sessile large and strong on the long feet of the octopods as the argonauts and the octopus they adhere to external objects by the close application of their thick muscular margins and by forming a partial vacuum in their centre by these organs the cepha lopods can creep upwards on a vertical surface even when out of the water the octopus destitute of any lateral fins is assisted in swimming by muscular membranes extended between the bases of the feet this animal swims backwards by impelling the water forwards but the species which have lateral fins extending from their trunk can swim with ease either forwards or backwards and they appear to spring up wards sometimes to a distance from the surface of the sea these predacious animals have very powerful muscles con nected with the mastication of their food as well as with its prehension large sphincter muscles with a fimbriated fleshy lip surround the entrance of the mouth and strong retractor muscles of the jaws are inserted around the reso phageal opening of the cranium the bases of the jaws are surrounded with superimposed strata of powerful compressor muscles and the short thick fleshy tongue covered with numerous rows of sharp conical horny spines is moved by strong muscles attached to a rudimentary os hyoides the maxillary apparatus is also provided with two lateral rotator muscles which pass forwards to be inserted into its anterior part fifth section muscular system of the spinicerebrated or vertebrated classes the muscular system is placed on the exterior of the hard parts in the vertebrated animals its fibrous structure is here the most distinct and irritable and its separate muscles and fasciculi are most obvious and defined the muscles have generally a red colour from the red blood sent through them and they are connected with the bones for the most part by tendinous prolongations they are most pale soft and pellucid in fishes where their feebleness is compensated for by the great number which cooperate in the same move ment the progression of fishes being effected chiefly by the lateral motions of the tail and of the trunk the vertebral column is expanded vertically upwards and downwards and the great muscles of the trunk are disposed in transverse strata along its sides like those which move the segments of a worm or an insect the feeble irritability of the muscular fibres in fishes their softness and their colourless transpa rency correspond with their common conditions in the inver tebrata and in the embryos of the higher vertebrated classes and they accord with the still soft condition of the bones into which they are inserted aided in their ascent and descent in the water by the compression and expansion of their air sac and with very imperfectly developed arms and legs the active movements of fishes are but little varied their mus cles seldom divide into fasciculi or terminate in narrow ten dons to be attached to small points of their feeble skeleton the fibres which compose the great lateral muscles of the trunk run in a longitudinal direction are divided into nu merous transverse oblique strata by intervening tendinous aponeuroses and are disposed chiefly in four series of oblique muscles as seen in the perch fig o a b c d the in tervening white tendinous bands which connect these strata of muscles have a crescentic form are disposed vertically along the sides of the vertebrae and the ribs and are attached externally by their zigzag margin to the inner surface of the skin the upper series have their thin white tendons directed obliquely downwards and backwards the second b downwards and forwards the third c like the first and the fourth like the second the upper series of lateral muscles attached anteriorly to the occipital bone occupy the deep cavity on each side of its projecting spine and extend backwards to the longitudinal diverging tendons and muscles of the caudal fin in which they terminate the oblique direction of all these lateral muscles increases the velocity of their motions as in the intercostals of quadru peds these strata of muscles are arched backwards having all their convex surfaces directed forwards and as their fibres pass obliquely backwards and peripherad they draw their cutaneous attachments forwards and inwards when the ver tebrae are the fixed points they are attached also to the temporal bone and to the back part of the scapular arch and the inferior series d extends forwards under the arms n to the os hyoides the layers of these large lateral muscles of the trunk are seen similarly disposed in the cylindrical body of the cyclostome fishes in the compressed trunk of most of the osseous forms and also in the broad depressed body of the flat fishes they correspond with the vertebrae into which their aponeuroses are inserted and they are at once analogous to the muscles of the segments of articulata and to the more lengthened and isolated muscles of the ver tebral column and trunk in higher vertebrated classes the flat surfaces of the interspinous bones are covered with diverging muscular fibres which pass downwards and move them in every direction and exterior to these are larger dis tinct muscular fasciculi which are inserted into the broad bases of the rays of the median fins for their varied move ments the longitudinal straight muscles which extend along the median line of the dorsal and the abdominal sur face of the trunk are interrupted by the dorsal and anal fins the longitudinal straight muscle of the back in fishes generally commences from each side of the spine of the occipital bone and proceeds in two separate fasciculi to be inserted into the base of the anterior ray of the first dorsal fin when there are more than one dorsal fin it is extended in two fasciculi from the last ray of each of these fins to the first ray of the next and it is continued in the same manner from the last dorsal to the beginning of the caudal fin on the ven tral surface of the body the first pair of straight muscles generally pass from the scapular arch or the humeri to the anterior part of the pelvis the second pair e commence from the pelvis and passing on each side of the anus con tinue to the first ray of the anal fin h they are developed between the anal fins as between the dorsal when there are more than one and from the last ray of the posterior anal fin they are continued backwards to the beginning of the caudal fin by these longitudinal straight muscles above and below the median fins are moved and supported and the trunk is moved in a vertical plane the sides of the head are occupied by two large and powerful muscles apparently analogous to the masseter and the temporal muscles and which pass forwards and downwards to be in serted into the lower jaw the lower jaw is depressed both by muscles passing backwards from it to the os hyoides and by those which extend from the os hyoides to the scapular arch the operculum is raised by two or more short and broad muscles placed at its upper part and is depressed by short round muscles placed on the inner surface of the same part the branchiostegal rays are moved by short oblique muscles which descend from the opercular bones to these rays and by others which are interposed obliquely between each pair of rays like intercostal muscles in higher classes the branchial arches in the osseous fishes are attached by dis tinct muscles to the back part of the skull to the sides of the vertebrae and also to the scapular arch and the os hyoides in the cartilaginous fishes where there is no oper culum over the branchiae that apparatus is covered exter nally with a layer of short muscles like intercostals passing between soft cartilaginous bands like ribs the pectoral fins or arms have on each of their flat surfaces a band of adductor and abductor muscles fig which extend from the scapular arch to the commencement of the pha langes or rays these muscles act also as flexors and exten sors of the arms and correspond with the magnitude of these organs they are greatest in the expanded pectoral fins of the plagiostome fishes the ventral fins or feet are also moved by two similar muscles on each of their flat surfaces extending from the pelvic bones to the com mencement of the rays and corresponding in size and strength with the magnitude of the feet the anguillifo fishes want the feet and their muscular apparatus and the cyclostome fishes want also the arms and their muscles the muscular system is greatly relieved in the vertical motions of most fishes by the compression and expansion of their airsac but many of the fiat fishes and the cyclostome species are destitute of this aid and lie generally at the bottom of the water the movement of some fishes through the water is aided by a muscular disk in form of a sucker placed on the back part of the head in the remora on the fore part of the belly in the lumpsuck er and around the mouth in the lam preys by which they adhere to other animals or bodies moving through the water by the great development of the lateral muscles of the trunk the sawfish and the swordfish are enabled to use their offensive weapons with effect the large muscles of the anterior dorsal rays give powerful and varied movements to these parts in the silurus balistes lophius and many other fishes and the strength of those of the pectoral fins enable the flyingfishes to escape from the water and to move some hundred times their own length through the air the long compressed trunks of the perennibranchiate amphibia as the proteus the siren and the axolotl and of the tadpoles of the higher anurous species are moved through the water chiefly by the lateral motions of the ver tebral column and of the tail as in fishes and these motions are effected in the same manner by numerous transverse strata of longitudinal muscular fibres occupying chiefly the sides of the trunk these great lateral muscles are still comparatively pale bloodless and feeble and the tendinous intersections of their strata are thin soft and delicate the cellular substance interposed between the muscles of amphi bia is scanty of little consistence colourless and almost in a semifluid state there are yet few tendons connecting the muscles to the soft bones of the skeleton and there is gene rally very little connexion between the skin and the sub jacent muscles of the body the general disposition of the superficial muscles in the urodelous amphibia is seen on re moving the skin from the common crested triton triton cris tatus fig in the back view of the trunk fig short transverse strata of lateral muscles b separated from each other by thin soft tendinous aponeuroses are seen occupying the dorsal portion of the body from the occipital bone to the posterior extremity of the tail the muscular strata c which descend from these in a more oblique direction down wards and backwards are united together on the fore part of the abdomen fig b to form a large continuous descending oblique muscle but behind the anus c the tendinous inter sections d continue distinct along the tail below the vertebral column as well as above it in the rigid state of these lateral muscles in the tadpoles as in that of the rana paradoxa the sides of the trunk are marked by trans verse vertical furrows similar to those on the sides of fishes we perceive also in the tadpoles as in fishes a thin vertical prolongation of the skin along the upper and lower surfaces of the tail like dorsal and anal fins but unsupported by rays the recti abdominis of the tadpoles form a broad muscular expansion covering the fore part of the trunk di vided by several transverse tendinous intersections and tapering to the pelvis these two muscles become more contracted and narrow in the adult animal in the salaman der strong muscular fasciculi descend from the free ends of the short ribs of the trunk and expanding as they pass over the abdomen they unite to form a continuous external oblique the muscles of the extremities are more developed in these animals to support them on land than in the tritons and other aquatic species w r here they are little used for pro gressive motion in the anurous species in their adult state the muscular system is the most remote from that of fishes in its general characters and in the disposition of its parts which arises from their greater extent of respiration their inhabiting a rarer medium the great development of their extremities and the large portion of the trunk which they lose by their metamorphosis their muscles are more vascular dense redcoloured and strong more distinct and defined in their course and in their insertions more ventri cose seldom exhibiting parallel strata and generally inserted into distinct and often lengthened tendons from the leap ing and swimming habits of many of these species we per ceive their short trunk terminated by lengthened and strong legs and provided generally with less perfectly developed arms and the greater development of the extensors than of the flexors of the legs gives an anthropoid character to these extremities in the back view of the muscular system of the common frog rana esculenta fig the small size of levatores scapulae corresponds with the soft and feeble condition of the dorsal portion of these bones into which they are inserted the depressor of the lower jaw the sca pular and the subsca pular muscles occupy the anterior part of the back immediately behind the head having before them the broad temporal muscles and be hind them the quadratus lumborum the sa cro lumbalis and the dorsal portion of the obliquus externus the iliococcy geus is of great length like the coccygeal bone and the ilium to which it is attached and the transversus abdominis extends over a large portion of the trunk from the want of ribs in these anurous amphibia the intertransversales are of considerable breadth from the length of the transverse processes of the vertebrae the pectoralis major here of great size and strength is divided into several distinct parts which extend forwards inwards and backwards as separate flat muscular bands covering a great portion of the anterior surface of the trunk the muscles of the os hyoides are of great size as in fishes and the lower amphibia from the size of that bone and its importance in respiration where there are no ribs the pec toralis minor is also divided into several detached and di verging muscular bands like the external arid both these muscles acquire increased influence on the arm by their low insertion on the short humerus the deltoid the anco nei and most of the proximal muscles of the arm are strong ventricose masses and even the flexors and extensors of the wrist and fingers are short and fleshy giving an an thropoid character to these members the knees extend not forwards as in most vertebrata but directly outwards from the sides of the trunk and the long webbed feet have the same lateral direction the best adapted for swimming and leaping the glutei muscles are here long and narrow from the lengthened and cylindrical form of the iliac bones and also the iliaci muscles and the semi tendinosus the semimembranosus and other ex tensors of the thigh the recti and the vasti muscles and the other extensors of the kneejoint and also the gastrocnemius the tibialis posticus the peronei and other extensor muscles of the heel are here of great size and of great importance in the progressive motions of these animals both on land and in the water and by their great development they give a rotundity to the thighs and to the calfs unusual in the coldblooded vertebrata the plantar aponeurosis is here continued from the tendo achilles which has a moveable sesamoid bone where it plays over the heel so that the great extensors of the heeljoint contribute like wise to the flexion of the toes and the general support of the long webbed feet in swimming through the water or in leaping on the ground the higher classes of airbreathing vertebrata by respiring a purer element and by possessing organs more extensive and more complicated for the aeration of their blood have their muscular system encreased in energy and strength be yond that of the fishes and amphibia which for the most part are organized to move by means of their vertebral column through an element nearly of the same specific gravity as themselves the rarity of the medium through which most of the reptiles and higher animals move neces sitates this increased muscular strength and their bones have an increased solidity proportioned to the greater force of the muscles which are to act upon them the progres sive motion of serpents like that of fishes depends upon the movements of their trunk and their muscles are disposed so as to act with most effect on the sides of the vertebrae and on the ribs the deep grooves along the back between the spinous and the transverse processes on each side are occupied chiefly with the multifidus spina the spi nales and the semispinales dorsi which inflect powerfully the column to either side short as the distance is from one spinous process to another and between the short transverse processes which support the ribs those parts are moved se parately by strong interspinales and intertransversales mus cles the ribs being free at their distal extremities they admit of extensive motion and are furnished with large in tercostal muscles which partly represent the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen in higher animals the recti muscles are divided in front by the soft cartilaginous tapering extremities of the ribs as they are by tendinous in tersections in most of the higher animals these intercostal muscles of various lengths some passing directly from one rib to the next and others passing over one or more ribs to have a more distant insertion are strongest on the anterior portion of the trunk where their action is important in res piration by compressing and expanding the respiratory sacs the large imbricated abdominal scuta so important in the progression of serpents are moved and supported by dis tinct muscular fibres which pass down to their fixed ex tremities many of the ordinary muscles of the head as seen in that of the rattle snake fig have a lengthened and divided form in serpents from the elongated form and the great mobility of most of the bones of that part an terior to the external pterygoid and the digastric h muscles are seen three separate parts of the temporal muscle d ef a portion of this muscle e extending forwards like a buccinator embraces the posterior part of the poison gland a and forces the secretion into the duct and thence into the perforated fang b the strong muscles of the lower jaw w extend upwards to the vertebrae and backwards to the ribs and unite into a single band on their fore part the row of salivary glands b c extend back wards beneath the poison gland and forwards before the masseter muscle a the great length of all the muscles of the head and trunk of serpents contributes to the velocity of their movements and their numerous subdivisions contribute to the variety of their motions their muscles for the most part terminate in narrow shining tendinous bands which allows of a greater number of muscles being inserted into a limited space and consequently a greater variety in the movements of the articulations these elongated forms and tendinous terminations are most conspicuous in the ex ternal and internal muscles of the ribs which are the legs of these animals the cloaca has its distinct muscles for opening and closing that cavity the pelvic bones and rudi mentary feet sometimes developed are provided with mus cles analogous to those of the ventral fins and pelvic bones of fishes the scapular arch developed in the most per fect species is attached by muscles to the trunk though not yet destined to support atlantal extremities and the internal lateral muscles passing from the vertebras to the ribs form the rudiment of a diaphragm the muscles of saurian reptiles are more numerous and complicated than in ophidia because they possess members for progressive motion adapted sometimes for swimming and sometimes for running or climbing and sometimes these animals are organized for moving through the air the stratified disposition of the great lateral muscles of the trunk so conspicuous in the fishes the urodelous amphibia and even in the serpents is less marked in the comparatively motionless bodies of the saurian reptiles excepting in those which have scarcely yet the members developed this ar rangement of the muscles in regular series around the ver tebrae is still continued in the coccygeal region of the co lumn which together with the neck is more flexible than in the ophidia several muscles of the face are wanting on the rough and hard head of the crocodilian reptiles their temporal and masseter muscles are protected externally by the temporal frontal and malar bones and their insertions are on the inner surface of the lower jaw the muscles of the os hyoides and those which connect the head with the trunk are distinct and powerful as in most reptiles and those of the tail which is nearly as thick as the trunk are of great strength for the lateral motions of that part in swimming the short muscular legs of these animals diverging out wards scarcely raise the trunk oif the ground on which the saurians and most other reptiles rest the body when not in actual progression the legs in these aquatic sauria are compressed in form to facilitate their advancement in the water as in webfooted birds and they have strong extensor muscles to give impulse to their webbed feet more nimble movements and more light and pliant forms of the locomotive organs and of the wholebody are seen in most of the terrestrial climbing longtoedand longtailed lacertine sauria the direc tion outwards of the humerus and femur weakens the limbs and adapts them better for climbing and prehension than for support or for running the long fingers and toes with their powerful flexors in the lacertine sauria adapt them for climbing on trees in pursuit of their prey the opposed fingers and toes and the muscular prehensile tail of the chamoelion enable it to creep with security on the agitated branches the muscles of its eyes are not synchronous in their movements by which it commands an extensive field of vision without moving its head and the muscular clavate prehensile tongue is moved w r ith velocity like a sheath to and fro from the long body of the os hyoides the power ful intercostals of the flying dragon expand its ribs with their connecting skin and move them like wings to enable it to pursue its insect prey through the air the saurian reptiles possessing a more distinct cervical region than any of the inferior vertebrata and often carrying bulky prey to a distance in their jaws require a great development of the muscles which suspend and move their heavy head and neck as the recti and obliqui muscles of the head the splenii sca leniy complexus and serratus posticus the inter and semispi nales colli the transversalis trapezius and rhomboideus the fibres of ihepanniculus carnosus are intimately connected with the large osseous external plates of the loricated croco dilian reptiles but the skin is more free in the lacertine spe cies the external and internal obliqui abdominis and the transversalis are distinct in the crocodiles and also a rudi ment of the diaphragm the posterior portion of the diaphragm is likewise perceived in the dragons and geckos where it consists of muscular bands ascending from the bo dies of the vertebree to be attached to the ribs before them many of the ordinary muscles of the trunk are wanting in the chelonian reptiles from the immobility of the skeleton in that part of the body especially in the land species se veral muscles of the face are deficient from the immoveable horny covering of the jaws and lips and from the close ap plication of the horny scales to the periosteum in that part the muscles on the dorsal part of the spine and all the in tercostals are likewise deficient those of the cervical sa cral and coccygeal regions and those of the scapular and pelvic arches together with the muscles of the arms and legs are the most distinct and powerful in this order and correspond with the mobility of these parts or the weight they have to sustain the temporal muscles are covered over by the parietal bones in the turtles but in the tortoises where the whole head is easily withdrawn within the strong arched and capaceous carapace these muscles are exposed on the sides of the cranium fig a as in warmblooded animals the orbicularis palpebrarum fig a a is here thin and feeble and chiefly appropriated to the large moveable lower eyelid the oblique muscles of the eyeball are also very small while the recti and the suspensorius oculi fig b a are more distinct and strong the mylohyoideus fig a by and the latissimus colli a c here form a large panniculus carnosus covering the whole of the lower part of the sides of the neck the spinalis cervicis a d here forms numerous strong detached bands which prin cipally support the head and retract it when alarmed within the cavity of the trunk behind this muscle lies the inser tion of the longus colli a which has a similar action on the neck between these extends downwards the latissimus dorsi a e tapering to the humerus before which is the extended latissimus colli and the imperfect diaphragm a extending over the peritoneal covering of the lungs the obliqui a and the transversales abdominis a are here of considerable extent passing forwards around the abdominal cavity beneath the sternum and the ribs and assisting in respiration and in the discharge of all the natural excretions behind the diaphragmatic bands b m are the posterior insertions of the large retrahentes capitis et colli b k which extend forwards along the back part of the neck b to retract the head and neck under the ribs as the ribs are immoveable the motions of inspiration are ef fected chiefly by the os hyoides as in amphibia where the ribs are almost or completely wanting and most of the mus cles connected with that bone are large and distinct like the parts of the os hyoides itself the geniohyoideus b forms a broad muscle extending forwards to the lower jaw and the omohyoideus b i y continues backwards as a broad muscular expansion covering the lower part of the neck the hyoglossus hyomaxillaris genioglossus are also here distinct and the stemomastoideus the digrasticus maxilla trachelomastoideus and most of the muscles which move the head are well marked in these longnecked ani mals the large pectoral muscles have an extensive attach ment to the interior of the sternum two broad muscles proceeding in different directions from the sternum to the pubic bones and constituting the attrahens and retrahens pelvim on each side appear to be the analogues of the recti abdominis the serratus magnus deltoides sub and super scapularis triceps a and biceps b y brachii and most of the succeeding muscles of the arm and hand are powerful especially in the land tortoises where the arms are fixed in a state of pronation the best suited to support the weight of the body the flexor sublimis a r forms a strong mus cular band on the outside of the forearm the broad ten dons of the extensor communis digitorum manus a s cover the back part of the carpus and on the upper part of the fingers are the five strong extensores breves digitorum manus a the brachialis internus b the palmaris b z the flexor profundus b and most of the flexor muscles of these extremities are strong both for support and for digging in the long finlike arms of the turtles the mus cles of the shoulders are those chiefly developed while the muscles of the forearm and hand are very feeble as in ceta ceous animals the ylutei a the iliacus internus and the psoas are strong muscles in the land species as are almost all the extensors and flexors of the thighbone the biceps cruris av and the semitendinosus a w form long muscular bands behind the femur and the rectus femoris a in front which unites below with the vastus externus a y the vastus internus and the crureus to be inserted into the tuberosity of the tibia below the knee by a common tendon the sartorius a z semimembranosus obturator and gracilisy have here their usual position and action the extensor communis digitorum pedis a and the short ex tensors of the four toes a resemble the corresponding muscles of the hand the peroneus a the gastrocnemii a and the other extensors are strong on the posterior as those on the anterior extremities in the tortoises to support and move their heavy body on the land but they are scarcely perceptible in the long flat finlike feet of the turtles the cloaca has its dilating and its sphincter muscles and the highly moveable tail has its numerous flexors and its exten sor muscles in the reptiles of this order and even the glottis the penis and the clitoris have already their accompanying muscles developed as in higher animals the muscles of birds are more red and vascular more irritable and dense than in the coldblooded vertebrata be neath them and they possess these properties in the greatest degree in the rapaceous tribes where the respiration is great est and where all the functions are most energetic this condition of the muscular system is required in birds from the lightness of the medium through which they move and from their quick and long continued movements through that element the muscles are more feeble pale soft and pala table in the heavy slowmoving phytophagous tribes where the condition of the bones and most of the other systems mark an inferior or reptile state of development the fleshy parts of the muscles are generally short and thick especially in the arms and legs of birds and their tendons are generally long slender dense and often ossified like many cartilagi nous parts of the skeleton the active heavy fleshy parts of the muscles being situate for the most part on or near the solid trunk of the bird the extreme parts so important for progression are lightened by receiving and supporting only the long narrow tendons hence the long slender legs and the lightness of the arms in this class as birds have nearly all the same general form and movements there is remarkable uniformity in the muscular system throughout this class their trunk being almost as fixed as in the che lonia the muscles destined to move that part are here also very imperfectly developed but its fixed condition affords the most advantageous attachment for the powerful muscles of the extremities which have generally a very high origin the arms and hands being entirely appropriated to flight and the legs and feet being constructed chiefly for support their long flexible neck and highly moveable head supply the place of anterior extremities for all ordinary purposes of prehension and the cervical region is therefore strong move able and muscular like the trunk of a serpent the face of the birds from the imrnoveable horny sheaths which cover the exterior of the jaws is like that of the crocodilian and chelonian reptiles destitute of many muscles destined to move the fleshy lips in other classes the temporal fig the masseter and the pterygoid muscles are powerful in birds and correspond with the great length and the mo bility of their lower jaw they are stronger in the rapacious birds from the resistance they have to overcome and they are most unequally developed on the two sides of the head in the crossbills which habitually draw the lower jaw to one side of the head the large eyes in this class are moved by four recti muscles as in mammalia and have their middle portion surrounded compressed and rotated by two obliqui the orbicularis palpebrarum expanded over their large orbit acts most on the lower eyelid as in inferior classes the lower eyelid has also its small depressor as the upper has its levator muscle and the membrana nictitaus with its long inferior tendon passing behind and over the ball is moved with great velocity by its pyramidalis and quadratus muscles the fixed condition of the dorsal vertebrae affords a more solid attachment to the muscles of the long neck and in rapaceous birds which frequently carry their prey suspended from their jaws to a distance through the air the neck is comparatively short and strong and the muscles of great power which move these vertebrae as seen in the annexed figure from carus representing the muscles of the falco y fig the recti postici and antici the obliqui capitis the splenii capitis et colli and the strong complexi fig c rotate the head on its single occipital condyle and bend the neck to either side the intertransversales inter spinales transversalis colli spi nales dorsi et colli trapezius cu cullaris biventur cervicis rhom boideus trachelomastoideus and scaleni muscles are also well marked in the flexible neck of birds and important in the move ments of this part of the skele ton the longus colli passes up wards from the spinous processes of the lower cervical and ante rior dorsal vertebra to be in serted into the transverse pro cesses of most of the vertebrae of the neck the external inter costals are divided each into an anterior and a posterior half by the osseous appendices extend ing backwards from the margins of the ribs and the internal in tercostals extend backwards no farther than these appendices the serrati the latissimus dorsi the obliquus externus and inter nus abdominis the transversalis and most of the muscles con fined to the trunk are feeble in this class the broad thin recti abdominis connected together by a broad linea alba and destitute of tendinous intersections diverge at their posterior or lower part to be inserted into the detached and feeble pubic bones the muscular parietes of the abdomen are here thin and feeble and very short from the greater portion of that ca vity being covered and supported by the large sternum and the muscular bands forming the rudimentary diaphragm ex tend upwards and inwards from the margins of the sternal ribs spreading like a thin aponeurosis over the peritoneum covering the abdominal surface of the lungs as in many of the coldblooded vertebrata the iliacus is here a small muscle within the pelvis and the psoas appears to be want ing but the glutei muscles are of great strength having to support the whole weight of the trunk upon the posterior extremities alone as in the human body the tail is moved and its feathers are expanded by several lateral muscles both above and below the coccygeal vertebrae extending from the sacrum to the spinous and to the transverse pro cesses and extending to the bases of the large quillfeathers themselves the anterior extremities like the posterior have the proximate muscles of great magnitude and strength while the more distant muscles of these parts are compara tively small and feeble and those are especially strong which are placed on the fore part of the sternum and effect the depression of the humerus the most powerful and important movement in the flight of birds the pectoralis major fig d covers nearly the whole surface of the sternum and its crest and continues its origin along the edge of the cla vicle and the surface of the broad ligament which unites the clavicle to the upper margin of the sternum the insertion of this muscle is extended along a great portion of the hu merusj and its magnitude corresponds most generally with the power of flight and the rapaceous character of the spe cies the subclavius the serrati the subscapularis and most of the muscles connected with the scapula on the upper part of the shoulder are small in birds as in reptiles and correspond with the limited extent of surface of that bone beneath the extended pectoralis major are the long narrow pectoralis minor and the coracobrachialis which from its position looks like a third pectoral muscle the integuments on the fore part of the wing are expanded like a web in the bent position of the arms by two long elastic tendons which originate from a strong cutaneous muscle like a deltoid extending from the scapula over the head of the hume rus fig d e one of these tendons is short and ex tends only to a small distance beyond the lower end of the humerus while the other extends to the wrist as seen in the annexed figure of the wing of the common buzzard in this back view of the muscles of the arm in a rapaceous bird the small thin cucullaris a a is seen ex tending outwards from the vertebral column and above it the two divisions of the latitsimus dorsi c d which cover also the infra spinatus b the short fleshy mass of the deltoid muscle extends to the middle of the humerus and behind it is the long triceps extensor cubiti g h on the forearm are seen the fleshy parts of the extensor carpi radialis i with its long tendon passing over the end of the radius the supinator radii brevis k the strong extensor digi torum communis and beneath this the extensor metacarpi ulnaris m n which has its long tendon inserted into the middle strong element of the single metacarpal bone in birds beneath the thumb is the very small flexor pollicis and on the ulnar side of the long middle finger is the tendon of the abductor indicis which passes down fleshy between the long anchylosed metacarpal bone and has its tendon inserted into the base of the last phalanx the flexor indicis has its tendon inserted into the distal extremity of that phalanx r the flexor carpi ulnaris p passes fleshy along the ulnar side of the outer metacarpal bone and the outer finger con sisting of a single minute phalanx has its own flexor digiti minimi s the muscles and articulations of the wing are chiefly adapted for adduction and abduction and they admit of little flexion and extension or promotion and supination excepting at the head of the humerus so that the whole arm moves with greater solidity and effect as an organ of flight and is more easily folded along the side of the trunk when in a state of repose on the posterior extremities the extensor muscles are more developed than the flexors from the trunk being supported by these members alone in walk ing from the extent and the fixed condition of the dorsal part of the pelvis the extensors of the femur have a high origin and a lengthened form and the glutens maximus me dius and minimus are developed in this region as in qua drupeds the glutens majcimus here reaches along the femur as low as the fibula passing below and behind the kneejoint the only distinct abductor of the femur is the gemellus supe rior which rotates the thigh outwards and this muscle is deficient in many aquatic birds the pyriformis quadratus femoris and obturator externus extend the femur and are aided by a muscle analogous to the pectineus the peroncus longus and the tibialis posticus arising from the back part of pelvis are connected below with the extensor tendon of the heel the rectus femoris arising from the upper part of the pubis continues its long tendon over the extensor tendon of the knee and unites below with the common perforated flexor of the toes the gracilis arises very low from the femur and acts as an extensor of the knee and the popliteus directed transversely is situated high on the tibia the foot is raised by the tibialis anticus which passes from the tibia to the metatarsal bone and rotates the foot inwards in the climb ing movements of the zygodactylous birds these birds have likewise the peroneus brevis of considerable size which arises from the exterior of the tibia and fibula and rotates the foot outwards the gastrocnemius fig u arises from the condyles of the femur and passes down thick and fleshy to the broad aponeurotic tendon of the heel which forms a groove for the passage of the flexor tendon of the toes and is inserted below into the long metatarsal bone behind the tibialis anticus fig r arises the fleshy head of the ex tensor longus digit orum fig the tendon of which bound down by strong ligaments in its course divides at the lower end of the metatarsal bone into three separate ten dons which proceed along the upper part of the toes to be inserted into the base of each terminal phalanx the pos terior toe has a distinct extensor muscle which descends from the upper part of the metatarsal bone and is inserted into both phalanges the long flexor of the toes descending from the upper part of tibia exterior to the gastrocnemius is con nected with two cartilages at the heeljoint which represent the astragalus and the calcaneum and which i have found in the ostrich in the condition of a large solid sesamoid bone the muscular system of the mammalia is greatly diversi fied by the variety of forms and habits of the animals which compose this class some of which are organized to move like fishes through the ocean some to burrow in the earth or to walk on its surface or to climb on trees and others to fly like birds through the air the differences here presented by the muscular system relate therefore chiefly to the organs of motion which vary according to the nature and situation of the food the fleshy parts of the muscles in mammalia are generally large and strong and proportioned to the more massive bones of the skeleton and the encreased weight of the whole trunk the respiration being less extensive here than in birds the tem perature is inferior the tendons are less inclined to ossify the circulation is slower the muscular fibres are less dense and their contractions are less energetic and the muscles compensate for their defective energy by their increase of bulk which gives a rotundity to the exterior form of the body and more massive proportions to all the parts of these animals as the cetaceous animals breathe by lungs and not by gills like fishes the muscles of their vertebral column are disposed chiefly for movements in a vertical plane and not for horizontal motions like those of the waterbreathing fishes the great elevation and breadth of the occipital region of the cranium afford an extensive surface of attachment as in fishes for the powerful muscles of their short fixed neck and extended moveable trunk from the great length of the transverse and spinous processes of nearly all the vertebrae of the trunk there is a large angular space on each side of the column for the numerous long and pow erful muscles which move the caudal vertebrae and the tail and the fleshy bodies of these muscles are very indistinctly separated from each other from the general similarity of their direction and uses the splenii muscles of the head and neck the longlssimus dorsi the sacrolumbalis the tra chelomastoideus the spinalis dorsi and the complexus are here especially distinct on the dorsal region of the column and important in its backward movements on the lower part of the column is the large quadratics lumborum and two muscles analogous to the psoas and the iliacus which power fully assist in the downward movements of the coccygeal vertebrae the oblique the transverse and the recti mus cles of the abdomen are lengthened and feeble on the long trunk of the cetacea and the abdominal ring is wanting as in other mammalia where the testes remain permanently in the abdominal cavity the proximate muscles of the an terior extremities the subscapular the infraspinati the pec toral and the deltoid muscles are those principally employed in the movements of these finlike organs the more distant muscles of these extremities however especially the flexors of the forearm and hand are much more developed in the herbivorous cetacea which are able to seize and to climb upon rocks the muscles of the pharynx of the os hyoides and of the exterior nares are numerous and distinct in these animals and correspond with the magnitude and the mobi lity of these parts the compressor muscles embracing the expanded nostrils of many of the blowing cetacea enable them forcibly to expel columns of water taken in by the mouth and the extension of these muscular cavities allows them to breathe freely while the rest of their body is beneath the surface of the water the cetacea like fishes amphibia and serpents consisting almost solely of the trunk are moved and supported by its muscles in the dense element they inhabit but the land quadrupeds require strong mem bers and strong muscular apparatus to support and move their heavy trunk in the light and unresisting element they breathe in the herbivorous quadrupeds the muscular energy and development are generally less than in the car nivorous species which corresponds with the inferior deve lopment of their respiratory and nervous systems and the diminished activity of all their functions the ruminantia like the pachyderma having no clavicles the humeri are ap proximated under the thorax and the anterior part of the trunk is suspended between the long vertical scapulae by the strong serrati muscles as by a band passing across beneath the chest from the weight and the horizontal position of the trunk the extensor muscles of the extremities are more developed than the flexors and to render these extremities more light and nimble the distal bones and tendons are lengthened and the heavy fleshy parts of the muscles as in birds have a high origin the number the divisions and the tendons of these muscles are fewer than in the more muscular and powerful carnivorous quadrupeds from the reduced number of the toes from the weight of the horns and the use made of these defensive organs in many of the larger ruminantia as the buffalo the bull the gnu and the bison the neck is short and the muscles which support and move the heavy head are large and powerful and the same is observed in many of the larger pachyderma from the weight of the teeth or tusks or proboscis or horns from the great size and mobility of the exterior concha of the ear in most of the herbivorous quadrupeds they present a great development of the attollens aurem and of the anterior and posterior auris and from the lengthened form of their face and jaws all the muscles of their lips and nostrils are gene rally lengthened and strong the muscles of the nose are particularly strong in the hogtribe to enable them to dig up their food with that organ of smell as they are also in the long flexible nostrils of the tapirs in the face of the elephant fig so remarkable for the extent and flexibility of the nostrils and for their sensibility and prehensile power the levator and zygomatic muscles a s of the upper lip are in corporated with those of the prolonged nostrils these levator muscles of the heavy proboscis have a strong tendi nous attachment laterally s to the zygojnatic bone and the anterior fasciculi a are attached to the malar the nasal and the frontal bones the upper portion of the orbicular is oris b is extended on each side along the base of the proboscis below the levator muscles s are seen the large branches of the trifacial nerve proceeding forwards to the muscles of the face and proboscis extending downwards and backwards from the angle of the mouth are several terminal fasciculi of the platisma myoides or panniculus carnosus c d q and be hind the ramus of the jaw is the large parotid gland with its duct passing forwards beneath the facial nerve above the parotid is the attrahens aurem o passing forwards to the malar bone and behind the outer margin of the ex panded orbicularis palpebrartim a is the opening of the short duct from the temporal gland beneath this gland descends the powerful temporal muscle k above which are the detached portions of the large att aliens aurem m n destined to move in different directions the great expanded concha of this animal detached muscular fasciculi h i descend from the frontal to raise the skin in the region of the eyebrows the depressor labii inferioris r is seen extend ing downwards from the margin of the lip and the levator anguli oris rising obliquely upwards and outwards from the angle of the mouth the panniculus carnosus which is scarcely perceptible over the trunk in the larger thickskinned pachyderma is a strong fleshy subcutaneous layer in the softer skinned ruminantia where it extends from the trunk over the neck to the head and is attached both to the hu merus and to the femur in the mammalia covered with spines as the echidna hedgehog porcupine and in those covered with imbricated scales as the manis and the arma dillo this muscle is also important in erecting or moving these epidermic organs and in coiling or uncoiling the body the neck is generally short thick and muscular in these ant eaters or loricated insectivorous quadrupeds to assist in exca vating the ground with their head in quest of food in the ro dentia as in birds the pterygoid and the temporal muscles are strong and the pteryoid processes of the sphenoid bone have a corresponding magnitude their masseter muscle is also of great breadth and by sending its fibres both forwards and back wards from the depressed zygomatic arch it assists in the longitudinal movement of the lower jaw in both these direc tions the whiteness or pale colour and the velocity of movement of the muscles of rodent quadrupeds present further affinities to the class of birds especially to the heavy inactive vegetableeating gallinaceous kinds where the blood is less rapidly and less extensively distributed through their muscular system than in the more powerful rapaceous tribes the flexor muscles of the arms are generally much deve loped and much exerted in this order of quadrupeds either for scraping the ground for food or for burrowing in the earth or for climbing upon trees and cliffs in the marsupial quadrupeds the abdominal pouch is em braced externally by the panniculus carnosus the fibres of which serve by their extension over the pouch to the sym phisis pubis to contract that cavity so as closely to embrace the newlyreceived young and to protect them during the first period of their extrauterine life within this pouch are the mammary glands which are embraced by distinct muscular fasciculi destined to compress them and to aid the escape of their secretion and other delicate fasciculi force the milk from the ducts and the nipples into the mouth of these abortive foetuses and thus to extend the nipples from their ordinary retracted condition the muscular system of carnivorous quadrupeds corresponds in its high develop ment with the solid texture of their bones and the great extent of their respiration the nutritious character of their food and the living habits and wants of the species by the magnitude and the extension forwards of the zygomatic arch their large temporal and masseter muscles have an ad vanced insertion on the lower jaw most favourable to their action which is aided by the short truncated or rounded form of the head especially in the feline animals the leva tor muscles of the lips and nose serve by their magnitude to uncover the large tusks to prevent injury of the lips in seizing the prey and to add ferocity to the aspect to in timidate and overcome that prey the muscles of their short and thick neck are strong to enable them to carry off their prey entire or to tear it to pieces as those of their shoulder and arm are powerful to enable them to grasp or hold down their prey or to strike it to the ground and they assist in bending forwards the trunk in striking by their large recti abdominis which here extend forwards to the anterior end of the sternum the great extent of the fleshy part of their diaphragm aids their rapid and extensive respiration the central tendinous portion of the diaphragm is much more ex tensive and consequently the muscular part less in the ru minating and other herbivorous quadrupeds the muscles of the lower jaw in the cheiroptera and the levators of the upper lip are generally strong as in the carnivora and most of them are nocturnal predaceous animals but as they pursue their prey through the air the muscles proceeding from their scapula their clavicle and their sternum to the humerus are of great size and strength and the flexors of their carpus and fingers send down very long and thin tendons to the lengthened phalanges of the fingers so as to lighten the dis tal extremities of the hands and to adapt them for progres sion through so rare a medium the quadrumanous animals being organized for a semierect position and climbing move ments have the flexor muscles strongly developed on all their extremities and
