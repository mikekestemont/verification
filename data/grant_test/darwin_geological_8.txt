according to miers its surface is feet above the level of the sea it is from ten to fifteen miles in width and is said to extend with an unbroken surface for miles northwards it is drained by two rivers passing through breaches in the mountains to the east on the banks of the r mendoza it is seen to be composed of a great accumulation of stratified shingle estimated at feet in thickness in general appearance and in numerous points of structure this plan closely resembles those of chile the origin and manner of formation of the thick beds of gravel sandy clay volcanic detritus and calcareous tuff composing these basinlike plains is very important because as we shall presently show they send arms or fringes far up the main valleys of the cordillera many of the inhabitants believe that these plains were once occupied by lakes suddenly drained but i conceive that the number of the separate breaches at nearly the same level in the mountains surrounding them quite precludes this idea had not such distinguished naturalists as mm meyen and gay stated their belief that these deposits were left by great debacles rushing down from the cordillera i should not have noticed a view which appears to me from many reasons improbable in the highest degreenamely from the vast accumulation of wellrounded pebblestheir frequent stratification with layers of sandthe overlying beds of calcareous tuffthis same substance coating and uniting the fragments of rock on the hummocks in the plain of santiagoand lastly even from the worn rounded and much denuded state of these hummocks and of the headlands which project from the surrounding mountains on the other hand these several circumstances as well as the continuous union of the basins at the foot of the cordillera with the great plain of the rio rapel which still retains the marks of seaaction at various levels and their general similarity in form and composition with the many plains near the coast which are either similarly marked or are strewed with upraised marine remains fully convince me that the mountains bounding these basinplains were breached their isletlike projecting rocks worn and the loose stratified detritus forming their now level surfaces deposited by the sea as the land slowly emerged it is hardly possible to state too strongly the perfect resemblance in outline between these basinlike long and narrow plains of chile especially when in the early morning the mists hanging low represented water and the creeks and fiords now intersecting the southern and western shores of the continent we can on this view of the sea when the land stood lower having long and tranquilly occupied the spaces between the mountainranges understand how the boundaries of the separate basins were breached in more than one place for we see that this is the general character of the inland bays and channels of tierra del fuego we there also see in the sawing action of the tides which flow with great force in the cross channels a power sufficient to keep the breaches open as the land emerged we can further see that the waves would naturally leave the smooth bottom of each great bay or channel as it became slowly converted into land gently inclined to as many points as there were mouths though which the sea finally retreated thus forming so many watersheds without any marked ridges on a nearly level surface the absence of marine remains in these high inland plains cannot be properly adduced as an objection to their marine origin for we may conclude from shells not being found in the great shingle beds of patagonia though copiously strewed on their surfaces and from many other analogous facts that such deposits are eminently unfavourable for the embedment of such remains and with respect to shells not being found strewed on the surface of these basinplains it was shown in the last chapter that remains thus exposed in time decay and disappear i observed some appearances on the plains at the eastern and opposite foot of the cordillera which are worth notice as showing that the sea there long acted at nearly the same level as on the basinplains of chile the mountains on this eastern side are exceedingly abrupt they rise out of a smooth taluslike very gentle slope from five to ten miles in width as represented in the following diagram entirely composed of perfectly rounded pebbles often whitewashed with an aluminous substance like decomposed feldspar this sloping plain or talus blends into a perfectly flat space a few miles in width composed of reddish impure clay with small calcareous concretions as in the pampean depositof fine white sand with small pebbles in layersand of the abovementioned white aluminous earth all interstratified together this flat space runs as far as mendoza thirty miles northward and stands probably at about the same height namely feet pentland and miers above the sea to the east it is bounded by an escarpment eighty feet in height running for many miles north and south and composed of perfectly round pebbles and loose whitewashed or embedded in the aluminous earth behind this escarpment there is a second and similar one of gravel northward of mendoza these escarpments become broken and quite obliterated and it does not appear that they ever enclosed a lakelike area i conclude therefore that they were formed by the sea when it reached the foot of the cordillera like the similar escarpments occurring at so many points on the coasts of chile and patagonia the taluslike plain slopes up with a smooth surface into the great dry valleys of the cordillera on each hand of the portillo valley the mountains are formed of red granite micaslate and basalt which all have suffered a truly astonishing amount of denudation the gravel in the valley as well as on the taluslike plain in front of it is composed of these rocks but at the mouth of the valley in the middle height probably about feet above the sea a few small isolated hillocks of several varieties of porphyry project round which on all sides smooth and often whitewashed pebbles of these same porphyries to the exclusion of all others extend to a circumscribed distance now it is difficult to conceive any other agency except the quiet and longcontinued action of the sea on these hillocks which could have rounded and whitewashed the fragments of porphyry and caused them to radiate from such small and quite insignificant centres in the midst of that vast stream of stones which has descended from the main cordillera sloping terraces of gravel in the valleys of the cordilleraall the main valleys on both flanks of the chilian cordillera have formerly had or still have their bottoms filled up to a considerable thickness by a mass of rudely stratified shingle in central chile the greater part of this mass has been removed by the torrents cliffbounded fringes more or less continuous being left at corresponding heights on both sides of the valleys these fringes or as they may be called terraces have a smooth surface and as the valleys rise they gently rise with them hence they are easily irrigated and afford great facilities for the construction of the roads from their uniformity they give a remarkable character to the scenery of these grand wild broken valleys in width the fringes vary much sometimes being only broad enough for the roads and sometimes expanding into narrow plains their surfaces besides gently rising up the valley are slightly inclined towards its centre in such a manner as to show that the whole bottom must once have been filled up with a smooth and slightly concave mass as still are the dry unfurrowed valleys of northern chile where two valleys unite into one these terraces are particularly well exhibited as is represented in the following diagram the thickness of the gravel forming these fringes on a rude average may be said to vary from thirty to sixty or eighty feet but near the mouths of the valleys it was in several places from to feet the amount of matter removed by the torrents has been immense yet in the lower parts of the valleys the terraces have seldom been entirely worn away on either side nor has the solid underlying rock been reached higher up the valleys the terraces have frequently been removed on one or the other side and sometimes on both sides but in this latter case they reappear after a short interval on the line which they would have held had they been unbroken where the solid rock has been reached it has been cut into deep and narrow gorges still higher up the valleys the terraces gradually become more and more broken narrower and less thiek until at a height of from to feet they become lost and blended with the piles of fallen detritus i carefully examined in many places the state of the gravel and almost everywhere found the pebbles equally and perfectly rounded occasionally with great blocks of rock and generally distinctly stratified often with parting seams of sand the pebbles were sometimes coated with a white aluminous and less frequently with a calcareous crust at great heights up the valleys the pebbles become less rounded and as the terraces become obliterated the whole mass passes into the nature of ordinary detritus i was repeatedly struck with the great difference between this detritus high up the valleys and the gravel of the terraces low down namely in the greater number of the quite angular fragments in the detritusin the unequal degree to which the other fragments have been roundedin the quantity of associated earthin the absence of stratificationand in the irregularity of the upper surfaces this difference was likewise well shown at points low down the valleys where precipitous ravines cutting through mountains of highly coloured rock have thrown down wide fanshaped accumulations of detritus on the terraces in such cases the line of separation between the detritus and the terrace could be pointed out to within an inch or two the detritus consisting entirely of angular and only partially rounded fragments of the adjoining coloured rocks the stratified shingle as i ascertained by close inspection especially in one case in the valley of the r mendoza containing only a small proportion of these fragments and those few well rounded i particularly attended to the appearance of the terraces where the valleys made abrupt and considerable bends but i could perceive no difference in their structure they followed the bends with their usual nearly equable inclination i observed also in several valleys that wherever large blocks of any rock became numerous either on the surface of the terrace or embedded in it this rock soon appeared higher up in situ thus i have noticed blocks of porphyry of andesitic syenite of porphyry and of syenite alternately becoming numerous and in each case succeeded by mountains thus constituted there is however one remarkable exception to this rule for along the valley of the cachapual m gay found numerous large blocks of white granite which does not occur in the neighbourhood i observed these blocks as well as others of andesitic syenite not occurring here in situ near the baths of cauquenes at a height of between and feet above the river and therefore quite above the terrace or fringe which borders that river some miles higher up the valleys there were other blocks at about the same height i also noticed at a less height just above the terrace blocks of porphyries apparently not found in the immediately impending mountains arranged in rude lines as on a seabeach all these blocks were rounded and though large not gigantic like the true erratic boulders of patagonia and fuegia m gay states that granite does not occur in situ within a distance of twenty leagues i suspect for several reasons that it will ultimately be found at a much less distance though certainly not in the immediate neighbourhood the boulders found by mm meyen and gay on the upper plain of s fernando mentioned in a previous note probably belong to this same class of phenomena these fringes of stratified gravel occur along all the great valleys of the cordillera as well as along their main branches they are strikingly developed in the valleys of the maypu mendoza aconcagua cachapual and according to meyen in the tinguirica in the valleys however of northern chile and in some on the eastern flank of the cordillera as in the portillo valley where streams have never flowed or are quite insignificant in volume the presence of a mass of stratified gravel can be inferred only from the smooth slightly concave form of the bottom one naturally seeks for some explanation of so general and striking a phenomenon that the matter forming the fringes along the valleys or still filling up their entire beds has not fallen from the adjoining mountains like common detritus is evident from the complete contrast in every respect between the gravel and the piles of detritus whether seen high up the valleys on their sides or low down in front of the more precipitous ravines that the matter has not been deposited by debacles even if we could believe in debacles having rushed down every valley and all their branches eastward and westward from the central pinnacles of the cordillera we must admit from the following reasonsfrom the distinct stratification of the massits smooth upper surfacethe wellrounded and sometimes encrusted state of the pebbles so different from the loose débris on the mountainsand especially from the terraces preserving their uniform inclination round the most abrupt bends to suppose that as the land now stands the rivers deposited the shingle along the course of every valley and all their main branches appears to me preposterous seeing that these same rivers not only are now removing and have removed much of this deposit but are everywhere tending to cut deep and narrow gorges in the hard underlying rocks i have stated that these fringes of gravel the origin of which are inexplicable on the notion of debacles or of ordinary alluvial action are directly continuous with the similarlycomposed basinlike plains at the foot of the cordillera which from the several reasons before assigned i cannot doubt were modelled by the agency of the sea now if we suppose that the sea formerly occupied the valleys of the chilian cordillera in precisely the same manner as it now does in the more southern parts of the continent where deep winding creeks penetrate into the very heart of and in the case of obstruction sound quite through this great range and if we suppose that the mountains were upraised in the same slow manner as the eastern and western coasts have been upraised within the recent period then the origin and formation of these sloping terracelike fringes of gravel can be simply explained for every part of the bottom of each valley will on this view have long stood at the head of a seacreek into which the then existing torrents will have delivered fragments of rocks where by the action of the tides they will have been rolled sometimes encrusted rudely stratified and the whole surface levelled by the blending together of the successive beach lines as the land rose the torrents in every valley will have tended to have removed the matter which just before had been arrested on or near the beachlines the torrents also having continued to gain in force by the continued elevation increasing their total descent from their sources to the sea this slow rising of the cordillera which explains so well the otherwise inexplicable origin and structure of the terraces judging from all known analogies will probably have been interrupted by many periods of rest but we ought not to expect to find any evidence of these periods in the structure of the gravelterraces for as the waves at the heads of deep creeks have little erosive power so the only effect of the sea having long remained at the same level will be that the upper parts of the creeks will have become filled up at such periods to the level of the water with gravel and sand and that afterwards the rivers will have thrown down on the filledup parts a talus of similar matter of which the inclination as at the head of a partially filledup lake will have been determined by the supply of detritus and the force of the stream hence after the final conversion of the creeks into valleys almost the only difference in the terraces at those points at which the sea stood long will be a somewhat more gentle inclination with riverworn instead of seaworn detritus on the surface i know of only one difficulty on the foregoing view namely the fartransported blocks of rock high on the sides of the valley of the cachapual i will not attempt any explanation of this phenomenon but i may state my belief that a mountainridge near the baths of cauquenes has been upraised long subsequently to all the other ranges in the neighbourhood and that when this was effected the whole face of the country must have been greatly altered in the course of ages moreover in this and other valleys events may have occurred like but even on a grander scale than that described by molina when a slip during the earthquake of banked up for ten days the great river lontué which then bursting its barrier inundated the whole country and doubtless transported many great fragments of rock finally notwithstanding this one case of difficulty i cannot entertain any doubt that these terracelike fringes which are continuously united with the basinshaped plains at the foot of the cordillera have been formed by the arrestment of riverborne detritus at successive levels in the same manner as we see now taking place at the heads of all those many deep winding fiords intersecting the southern coasts to my mind this has been one of the most important conclusions to which my observations on the geology of south america have led me for we thus learn that one of the grandest and most symmetrical mountainchains in the world with its several parallel lines have been together uplifted in mass between and feet in the same gradual manner as have the eastern and western coasts within the recent period formation of valleys the bulk of solid rock which has been removed in the lower parts of the valleys of the cordillera has been enormous it is only by reflecting on such cases as that of the gravel beds of patagonia covering so many thousand square leagues of surface and which if heaped into a ridge would form a mountainrange almost equal to the cordillera that the amount of denudation becomes credible the valleys within this range often follow anticlinal but rarely synclinal lines that is the strata on the two sides more often dip from the line of valley than towards it on the flanks of the range the valleys most frequently run neither along anticlinal nor synclinal axes but along lines of flexure or faults that is the strata on both sides dip in the same direction but with different though often only slightly different inclinations as most of the nearly parallel ridges which together form the cordillera run approximately north and south the east and west valleys cross them in zigzag lines bursting through the points where the strata have been least inclined no doubt the greater part of the denudation was affected at the periods when tidal creeks occupied the valleys and when the outer flanks of the mountains were exposed to the full force of an open ocean i have already alluded to the power of the tidal action in the channels connecting great bays and i may here mention that one of the surveying vessels in a channel of this kind though under sail was whirled round and round by the force of the current we shall hereafter see that of the two main ridges forming the chilian cordillera the eastern and loftiest one owes the greater part of its angular upheaval to a period subsequent to the elevation of the western ridge and it is likewise probable that many of the other parallel ridges have been angularly upheaved at different periods consequently many parts of the surfaces of these mountains must formerly have been exposed to the full force of the waves which if the cordillera were now sunk into the sea would be protected by parallel chains of islands the torrents in the valleys certainly have great power in wearing the rocks as could be told by the dull rattling sound of the many fragments night and day hurrying downwards and as was attested by the vast size of certain fragments which i was assured had been carried onwards during floods yet we have seen in the lower parts of the valleys that the torrents have seldom removed all the seachecked shingle forming the terraces and have had time since the last elevation in mass only to cut in the underlying rocks gorges deep and narrow but quite insignificant in dimensions compared with the entire width and depth of the valleys along the shores of the pacific i never ceased during my many and long excursions to feel astonished at seeing every valley ravine and even little inequality of surface both in the hard granitic and soft tertiary districts retaining the exact outline which they had when the sea left their surfaces coated with organic remains when these remains shall have decayed there will be scarcely any difference in appearance between this line of coastland and most other countries which we are accustomed to believe have assumed their present features chiefly through the agency of the weather and freshwater streams in the old granitic districts no doubt it would be rash to attribute all the modifications of outline exclusively to the seaaction for who can say how often this lately submerged coast may not previously have existed as land worn by running streams and washed by rain this source of doubt however does not apply to the districts superficially formed of the modern tertiary deposits the valleys worn by the sea through the softer formations both on the atlantic and pacific sides of the continent are generally broad winding and flatbottomed the only district of this nature now penetrated by arms of the sea is the island of chiloe finally the conclusion at which i have arrived with respect to the relative powers of rain and sea water on the land is that the latter is far the most efficiënt agent and that its chief tendency is to widen the valleys whilst torrents and rivers tend to deepen them and to remove the wreck of the seas destroying action as the waves have more power the more open and exposed the space may be so will they always tend to widen more and more the mouths of valleys compared with their upper parts hence doubtless it is that most valleys expand at their mouthsthat part at which the rivers flowing in them generally have the least wearing power when reflecting on the action of the sea on the land at former levels the effect of the great waves which generally accompany earthquakes must not be overlooked few years pass without a severe earthquake occurring on some part of the west coast of south america and the waves thus caused have great power at concepcion after the shock of i saw large slabs of sandstone one of which was six feet long three in breadth and two in thickness thrown high up on the beach and from the nature of the marine animals still adhering to it it must have been torn up from a considerable depth on the other hand at callao the recoilwave of the earthquake of carried great masses of brickwork between three and four feet square some way out seaward during the course of ages the effect thus produced at each successive level cannot have been small and in some of the tertiary deposits on this line of coast i observed great boulders of granite and other neighbouring rocks embedded in fine sedimentary layers the transportal of which except by the means of earthquakewaves always appeared to me inexplicable superficial saline deposits this subject may be here conveniently treated of i will begin with the most interesting case namely the superficial saline beds near iquique in peru the porphyritic mountains on the coast rise abruptly to a height of between and feet between their summits and an inland plain on which the celebrated deposit of nitrate of soda lies there is a high undulatory district covered by a remarkable superficial saliferous crust chiefly composed of common salt either in white hard opaque nodules or mingled with sand in this latter case forming a compact sandstone this saliferous superficial crust extends from the edge of the coastescarpment over the whole face of the country but never attains as i am assured by mr bollaert long resident here any great thickness although a very slight shower falls only at intervals of many years yet small funnelshaped cavities show that the salt has been in some parts dissolved in several places i saw large patches of sand quite moist owing to the quantity of muriate of lime as ascertained by mr t reeks contained in them from the compact saltcemented sand being either red purplish or yellow according to the colour of the rocky strata on which it rested i imagined that this substance had probably been derived through common alluvial action from the layers of salt which occur interstratified in the surrounding mountains but from the interesting details given by m dorbigny and from finding on a fresh examination of this agglomerated sand that it is not irregularly cemented but consists of thin layers of sand of different tints of colour alternating with excessively fine parallel layers of salt i conclude that it is not of alluvial origin m dorbigny observed analogous saline beds extending from cobija for five degrees of latitude northward and at heights varying from to feet from finding recent seashells strewed on these saliferous beds and under them great wellrounded blocks exactly like those on the existing beach he believes that the salt which is invariably superficial has been left by the evaporation of the seawater this same conclusion must i now believe be extended to the superficial saliferous beds of iquique though they stand about feet above the level of the sea associated with the salt in the superficial beds there are numerous thin horizontal layers of impure dirtywhite friable gypseous and calcareous tuffs the gypseous beds are very remarkable from abounding with so as sometimes to be almost composed of irregular concretions from the size of an egg to that of a mans head of very hard compact heavy gypsum in the form of anhydrite this gypsum contains some foreign particles of stone it is stained judging from its action with borax with iron and it exhales a strong aluminous odour the surfaces of the concretions are marked by sharp radiating or bifurcating ridges as if they had been but not really corroded internally they are penetrated by branching veins like those of calcareous spar in the septaria of the london clay of pure white anhydrite these veins might naturally have been thought to have been formed by subsequent infiltration had not each little embedded fragment of rock been likewise edged in a very remarkable manner by a narrow border of the same white anhydrite this shows that the veins must have been formed by a process of segregation and not of infiltration some of the little included and cracked fragments of foreign rock are penetrated by the anhydrite and portions have evidently been thus mechanically displaced at st helena i observed that calcareous matter deposited by rainwater also had the power to separate small fragments of rock from the larger masses i believe the superficial gypseous deposit is widely extended i received specimens of it from pisagua forty miles north of iquique and likewise from africa where it coats a layer of pure salt m dorbigny found at cobija a bed of clay lying above a mass of upraised recent shells which was saturated with sulphate of soda and included thin layers of fibrous gypsum these widely extended superficial beds of salt and gypsum appear to me an interesting geological phenomenon which could be presented only under a very dry climate the plain or basin on the borders of which the famous bed of nitrate of soda lies is situated at a distance of about thirty miles from the sea being separated from it by the saliferous district just described it stands at a height of feet its surface is level and some leagues in width it extends forty miles northward and has a total length as i was informed by mr belford wilson the consulgeneral at lima of miles in a well near the works thirtysix yards in depth sand earth and a little gravel were found in another well near almonte fifty yards deep the whole consisted according to mr blake of clay including a layer of sand two feet thick which rested on fine gravel and this on coarse gravel with large rounded fragments of rock in many parts of this now utterly desert plain rushes and large prostrate trees in a hardened state apparently mimosas are found buried at a depth from three to six feet according to mr blake they have all fallen to the southwest the bed of nitrate of soda is said to extend for forty or fifty leagues along the western margin of the plain but is not found in its central parts it is from two to three feet in thickness and is so hard that it is generally blasted with gunpowder it slopes gently upwards from the edge of the plain to between ten and thirty feet above its level it rests on sand in which it is said vegetable remains and broken shells have been found shells have also been found according to mr blake both on and in the nitrate of soda it is covered by a superficial mass of sand containing nodules of common salt and as i was assured by a miner much soft gypseous matter precisely like that in the superficial crust already described certainly this crust with its characteristic concretions of anhydrite comes close down to the edge of the plain the nitrate of soda varies in purity in different parts and often contains nodules of common salt according to mr blake the proportion of nitrate of silver varies from twenty to seventyfive per cent the mother water at some of the refineries is very rich in iodic salts and is supposed to contain much muriate of lime in an unrefined specimen brought home by myself mr t reeks has ascertained that the muriate of lime is very abundant with respect to the origin of this saline mass from the manner in which the gently inclined compact bed follows for so many miles the sinuous margin of the plain there can be no doubt that it was deposited from a sheet of water from the fragments of embedded shells from the abundant iodic salts from the superficial saliferous crust occurring at a higher level and being probably of marine origin and from the plain resembling in form those of chile and that of uspallata there can be little doubt that this sheet of water was at least originally connected with the sea thin superficial saline incrustationsthese saline incrustations are common in many parts of america humboldt met with them on the tableland of mexico and the jesuit falkner and other authors state that they occur at intervals over the vast plains extending from the mouth of the plata to rioja and catamarca hence it is that during droughts most of the streams in the pampas are saline i nowhere met with these incrustations so abundantly as near bahia blanca square miles of the mudflats which near that place are raised only a few feet above the sea just enough to protect them from being overflowed appear after dry weather whiter than the ground after the thickest hoarfrost after rain the salts disappear and every puddle of water becomes highly saline as the surface dries the capillary action draws the moisture up pieces of broken earth dead sticks and tufts of grass where the salt effloresces the incrustation where thickest does not exceed a quarter of an inch m parchappe has analysed it and finds that the specimens collected at the extreme head of the low plain near the r manuelo consist of ninetythree per cent of sulphate of soda and seven of common salt whilst the specimens taken close to the coast contain only sixtythree per cent of the sulphate and thirtyseven of the muriate of soda this remarkable fact together with our knowledge that the whole of this low muddy plain has been covered by the sea within the recent period must lead to the suspicion that the common salt by some unknown process becomes in time changed into the sulphate friable calcareous matter is here abundant and the case of the apparent double decomposition of the shells and salt on s lorenzo should not be forgotten the saline incrustations near bahia blanca are not confined to though most abundant on the low muddy flats for i noticed some on a calcareous plain between thirty and forty feet above the sea and even a little occurs in still higher valleys low alluvial tracts in the valleys of the rivers negro and colorado are also encrusted and in the latter valley such spaces appeared to be occasionally overflowed by the river i observed saline incrustations in some of the valleys of southern patagonia at port desire a low flat muddy valley was thickly incrusted by salts which on analysis by mr t reeks are found to consist of a mixture of sulphate and muriate of soda with carbonate of lime and earthy matter on the western side of the continent the southern coasts are much too humid for this phenomenon but in northern chile i again met with similar incrustations on the hardened mud in parts of the broad flatbottomed valley of copiapo the saline matter incrusts the ground to the thickness of some inches specimens sent by mr bingley to apothecaries hall for analysis were said to consist of carbonate and sulphate of soda much sulphate of soda is found in the desert of atacama in all parts of s america the saline incrustations occur most frequently on low damp surfaces of mud where the climate is rather dry and these low surfaces have in almost every case been upraised above the level of the sea within the recent period saltlakes of patagonia and la platasalinas or natural saltlakes occur in various formations on the eastern side of the continentin the argillaceocalcareous deposit of the pampas in the sandstone of the rio negro where they are very numerous in the pumiceous and other beds of the patagonian tertiary formation and in small primary districts in the midst of this latter formation port s julian is the most southerly point lat to at which salinas are known to occur the depressions in which these saltlakes lie are from a few feet to sixty mètres as asserted by m dorbigny below the surface of the surrounding plains and according to this same author near the rio negro they all trend either in the ne and sw or in e and w lines coincident with the general slope of the plain these depressions in the plain generally have one side lower than the others but there are no outlets for drainage under a less dry climate an outlet would soon have been formed and the salt washed away the salinas occur at different elevations above the sea they are often several leagues in diameter they are generally very shallow but there is a deep one in a quartzrock formation near c blanco in the wet season the whole or a part of the salt is dissolved being redeposited during the succeeding dry season at this period the appearance of the snowwhite expanse of salt crystallised in great cubes is very striking in a large salina northward of the rio negro the salt at the bottom during the whole year is between two and three feet in thickness the salt rests almost always on a thick bed of black muddy sand which is fetid probably from the decay of the burrowing worms inhabiting it in a salina situated about fifteen miles above the town of el carmen on the rio negro and three or four miles from the banks of that river i observed that this black mud rested on gravel with a calcareous matrix similar to that spread over the whole surrounding plains at port st julian the mud also rested on the gravel hence the depressions must have been formed anteriorly to or contemporaneously with the spreading out of the gravel i was informed that one small salina occurs in an alluvial plain within the valley of the rio negro and therefore its origin must be subsequent to the excavation of that valley when i visited the salina fifteen miles above the town the salt was beginning to crystallise and on the muddy bottom there were lying many crystals generally placed crossways of sulphate of soda as ascertained by mr reeks and embedded in the mud numerous crystals of sulphate of lime from one to three inches in length m dorbigny states that some of these crystals are acicular and more than even nine inches in length others are macled and of great purity those i found all contained some sand in their centres as the black and fetid sand overlies the gravel and that overlies the regular tertiary strata i think there can be no doubt that these remarkable crystals of sulphate of lime have been deposited from the waters of the lake the inhabitants call the crystals of selenite the padre del sal and those of the sulphate of soda the madre del sal they assured me that both are found under the same circumstances in several of the neighbouring salinas and that the sulphate of soda is annually dissolved and is always crystallised before the common salt on the muddy bottom the association of gypsum and salt in this case as well as in the superficial deposits of iquique appears to me interesting considering how generally these substances are associated in the older stratified formations mr reeks has analysed for me some of the salt from the salina near the rio negro he finds it composed entirely of chloride of sodium with the exception of of sulphate of lime and of of earthy matter there are no traces of iodic salts some salts from the salina chiquitos in the pampean formation is equally pure it is a singular fact that the salt from these salinas does not serve so well for preserving meat as seasalt from the cape de verde islands and a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per cent less valuable the purity of the patagonian salt or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all seawater is the only assignable cause for this inferiority a conclusion which is supported by the fact lately ascertained that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent chlorides with respect to the origin of the salt in the salinas the foregoing analysis seems opposed to the view entertained by m dorbigny and others and which seems so probable considering the recent elevation of this line of coast namely that it is due to the evaporation of seawater and to the drainage from the surrounding strata impregnated with seasalt i was informed i know not whether accurately that on the northern side of the salina on the rio negro there is a small brine spring which flows at all times of the year if this be so the salt in this case at least probably is of subterranean origin it at first appears very singular that freshwater can often be procured in wells and is sometimes found in small lakes quite close to these salinas i am not aware that this fact bears particularly on the origin of the salt but perhaps it is rather opposed to the view of the salt having been washed out of the surrounding superficial strata but not to its having been the residue of seawater left in depressions as the land was slowly elevated sir w parish states buenos ayres c pp and that this is the case near the great salinas westward of the s ventana i have seen similar statements in an ancient ms journal lately published by s angelis at iquique where the surface is so thickly encrusted with saline matter i tasted water only slightly brackish procured in a well thirtysix yards deep but here one feels less surprise at its presence as pure water might percolate under ground from the not very distant cordillera chapter xi on the formations of the pampas

externally sometimes stalactiformed they are of a compact structure but often penetrated as well as the mud by hairlike serpentine cavities and occasionally with irregular fissures in their centres lined with minute crystals of carbonate of lime they are of white brown or pale pinkish tints often marked by black dendritic manganese or iron they are either darker or lighter tinted than the surrounding mass they contain much carbonate of lime but exhale a strong aluminious odour and leave when dissolved in acids a large but varying residue of which the greater part consists of sand these concretions often unite into irregular strata and over very large tracts of country the entire mass consists of a hard but generally cavernous marly rock some of the varieties might be called calcareous tuffs dr carpenter has kindly examined under the microscope sliced and polished specimens of these concretions and of the solid marlrock collected in various places between the colorado and st fé bajada in the greater number dr carpenter finds that the whole substance presents a tolerably uniform amorphous character but with traces of incipient crystalline metamorphosis in other specimens he finds microscopically minute rounded concretions of an amorphous substance resembling in size those in oolitic rocks but not having a concentric structure united by a cement which is often crystalline in some dr carpenter can perceive distinct traces of shells corals polythalamia and rarely of spongoid bodies for the sake of comparison i sent dr carpenter specimens of the calcareous rock formed chiefly of fragments of recent shells from coquimbo in chile in one of these specimens dr carpenter finds besides the larger fragments microscopical particles of shells and a varying quantity of opaque amorphous matter in another specimen from the same bed he finds the whole composed of the amorphous matter with layers showing indications of an incipient crystalline metamorphosis hence these latter specimens both in external appearance and in microscopical structure closely resemble those of the pampas dr carpenter informs me that it is well known that chemical precipitation throws down carbonate of lime in the opaque amorphous state and he is inclined to believe that the longcontinued attrition of a calcareous body in a state of crystalline or semicrystalline aggregation as for instance in the ordinary shells of mollusca which when sliced are transparent may yield the same result from the intimate relation between all the coquimbo specimens i can hardly doubt that the amorphous carbonate of lime in them has resulted from the attrition and decay of the larger fragments of shell whether the amorphous matter in the marly rocks of the pampas has likewise thus originated it would be hazardous to conjecture for convenience sake i will call the marly rock by the name given to it by the inhabitants namely toscarock and the reddish argillaceous earth pampean mud this latter substance i may mention has been examined for me by professor ehrenberg and the result of his examination will be given under the proper localities i will commence my descriptions at a central spot namely at buenos ayres and thence proceed first southward to the extreme limit of the deposit and afterwards northward the plain on which buenos ayres stands is from thirty to forty feet in height the pampean mud is here of a rather pale colour and includes small nearly white nodules and other irregular strata of an unusually arenaceous variety of toscarock in a well at the depth of seventy feet according to ignatio nunez much toscarock was met with and at several points at feet deep beds of sand have been found i have already given a list of the recent marine and estuary shells found in many parts on the surface near buenos ayres as far as three and four leagues from the plata specimens from near ensenada given me by sir w parish where the rock is quarried just beneath the surface of the plain consist of broken bivalves cemented by and converted into white crystalline carbonate of lime i have already alluded in the first chapter to a specimen also given me by sir w parish from the a del tristan in which shells resembling in every respect the azara labiata dorbig as far as their worn condition permits of comparison are embedded in a reddish softish somewhat arenaceous marly rock after careful comparison with the aid of a microscope and acids i can perceive no difference between the basis of this rock and the specimens collected by me in many parts of the pampas i have also stated on the authority of sir w parish that northward of buenos ayres on the highest parts of the plain about forty feet above the plata and two or three miles from it numerous shells of the azara labiata and i believe of venus sinuosa occur embedded in a stratified earthy mass including small marly concretions and said to be precisely like the great pampean deposit hence we may conclude that the mud of the pampas continued to be deposited to within the period of this existing estuary shell although this formation is of such immense extent i know of no other instance of the presence of shells in it buenos ayres to the rio coloradowith the exception of a few metamorphic ridges the country between these two points a distance of geographical miles belongs to the pampean formation and in the southern part is generally formed of the harder and more calcareous varieties i will briefly describe my route about twentyfive miles ssw of the capital in a well forty yards in depth the upper part and as i was assured the entire thickness was formed of dark red pampean mud without concretions north of the r salado there are many lakes and on the banks of one near the guardia there was a little cliff similarly composed but including many nodular and stalactiform concretions i found here a large piece of tesselated armour like that of the glyptodon and many fragments of bones the cliffs on the salado consist of palecoloured pampean mud including and passing into great masses of toscarock here a skeleton of the megatherium and the bones of other extinct quadrupeds see the list at the end of this chapter were found large quantities of crystallized gypsum of which specimens were given me occur in the cliffs of this river and likewise as i was assured by mr lumb in the pampean mud on the r chuelo seven leagues from buenos ayres i mention this because m dorbigny lays some stress on the supposed absence of this mineral in the pampean formation southward of the salado the country is low and swampy with toscarock appearing at long intervals at the surface on the banks however of the tapalguen sixty miles south of the salado there is a large extent of toscarock some highly compact and even semicrystalline overlying pale pampean mud with the usual concretions thirty miles further south the small quartzridge of tapalguen is fringed on its northern and southern flank by little narrow flattopped hills of toscarock which stand higher than the surrounding plain between this ridge and the sierra of guitrugueyu a distance of sixty miles the country is swampy with the toscarock appearing only in four or five spots this sierra precisely like that of tapalguen is bordered by horizontal often cliffbounded little hills of toscarock higher than the surrounding plain here also a new appearance was presented in some extensive and level banks of alluvium or detritus of the neighbouring metamorphic rocks but i neglected to observe whether it was stratified or not between guitrugueyu and the sierra ventana i crossed a dry plain of toscarock higher than the country hitherto passed over and with small pieces of denuded tableland of the same formation standing still higher the marly or calcareous beds not only come up nearly horizontally to the northern and southern foot of the great quartzose mountains of the sierra ventana but interfold between the parallel ranges the superficial beds for i nowhere obtained sections more than twenty feet deep retain even close to the mountains their usual character the uppermost layer however in one place included pebbles of quartz and rested on a mass of detritus of the same rock at the very foot of the mountains there were some few piles of quartz and toscarock detritus including landshells but at the distance of only half a mile from these lofty jagged and battered mountains i could not to my great surprise find on the boundless surface of the calcareous plain even a single pebble quartzpebbles however of considerable size have at some period been transsported to a distance of between forty and fifty miles to the shores of bahia blanca the highest peak of the s ventana is by captain fitz roys measurement feet and the calcareous plain at its foot from observations taken by some spanish officers feet above the sealevel on the flanks of the mountains at a height of or feet above the plain there were a few small patches of conglomerate and breccia firmly cemented by ferruginous matter to the abrupt and battered face of the quartztraces being thus exhibited of ancient seaaction the high plain round this range sinks quite insensibly to the eye on all sides except to the north where its surface is broken into low cliffs round the sierras tapalguen guitrugueyu and between the latter and the ventana we have seen and shall hereafter see round some hills in banda oriental that the toscarock forms low flattopped cliffbounded hills higher than the surrounding plains of similar composition from the horizontal stratification and from the appearance of the broken cliffs the greater height of the pampean formation round these primary hills ought not to be altogether or in chief part attributed to these several points having been uplifted more energetically than the surrounding country but to the argillaceocalcareous mud having collected round them when they existed as islets or submarine rocks at a greater height than at the bottom of the adjoining open seathe cliffs having been subsequently worn during the elevation of the whole country in mass southward of the ventana the plain extends farther than the eye can range its surface is not very level having slight depressions with no drainage exits it is generally covered by a few feet in thickness of sandy earth and in some places according to m parchappe by beds of clay two yards thick on the banks of the sauce four leagues se of the ventana there is an imperfect section about feet in height displaying in the upper part toscarock and in the lower part red pampean mud at the settlement of bahia blanca the uppermost plain is composed of very compact stratified toscarock containing rounded grains of quartz distinguishable by the naked eye the lower plain on which the fortress stands is described by m parchappe as composed of solid tosearock but the sections which i examined appeared more like a redeposited mass of this rock with small pebbles and fragments of quartz i shall immediately return to the important sections on the shores of bahia blanca twenty miles southward of this place there is a remarkable ridge extending w by n and e by s formed of small separate flat topped steepsided hills rising between and feet above the pampean plain at its southern base which plain is a little lower than that to the north the uppermost stratum in this ridge consists of pale highly calcareous compact toscarock resting as seen in one place on reddish pampean mud and this again on a paler kind at the foot of the ridge there is a well in reddish clay or mud i have seen no other instance of a chain of hills belonging to the pampean formation and as the strata show no signs of disturbance and as the direction of the ridge is the same with that common to all the metamorphic lines in this whole area i suspect that the pampean sediment has in this instance been accumulated on and over a ridge of hard rocks instead of as in the case of the abovementioned sierras round their submarine flanks south of this little chain of toscarock a plain of pampean mud declines towards the banks of the colorado in the middle a well has been dug in red pampean mud covered by two feet of white softish highly calcareous toscarock over which lies sand with small pebbles three feet in thicknessthe first appearance of that vast shingle formation described in the eighth chapter in the first section after crossing the colorado an old tertiary formation namely the rio negro sandstone to be described in the next chapter is met with but from the accounts given me by the gauchos i believe that at the mouth of the colorado the pampean formation extends a little farther southwards bahia blancato return to the shores of this bay at monte hermoso there is a good section about feet in height of four distinct strata appearing to the eye horizontal but thickening a little towards the nw the uppermost bed about twenty feet in thickness consists of obliquely laminated soft sandstone including many pebbles of quartz and falling at the surface into loose sand the second bed only six inches thick is a hard darkcoloured sandstone the third bed is palecoloured pampean mud and the fourth is of the same nature but darker coloured including in its lower part horizontal layers and lines of concretions of not very compact pinkish toscarock the bottom of the sea i may remark to a distance of several miles from the shore and to a depth of between sixty and one hundred feet was found by the anchors to be composed of toscarock and reddish pampean mud professor ehrenberg has examined for me specimens of the two lower beds and finds in them three polygastrica and six phytolitharia of these only one spongolithis fustis is a marine form five of them are identical with microscopical structures of brackishwater origin hereafter to be mentioned form a central point in the pampean formation in these two beds especially in the lower one bones of extinct mammifers some embedded in their proper relative positions and others single are very numerous in a small extent of the cliffs these remains consist of first the head of ctenomys antiquus allied to the living c brasiliensis secondly a fragment of the remains of a rodent thirdly molar teeth and other bones of a large rodent closely allied to but distinct from the existing species of hydrochœrus and therefore probably an inhabitant of fresh water fourth and fifthly portions of vertebræ limbs ribs and other bones of two rodents sixthly bones of the extremities of some great megatheroid quadruped the number of the remains of rodents gives to this collection a peculiar character compared with those found in any other locality all these bones are compact and heavy many of them are stained red with their surfaces polished some of the smaller ones are as black as jet monte hermoso is between fifty and sixty miles distant in a se line from the ventana with the intermediate country gently rising towards it and all consisting of the pampean formation what relation then do these beds at the level of the sea and under it bear to those on the flanks of the ventana at the height of feet and on the flanks of the other neighbouring sierras which from the reasons already assigned do not appear to owe their greater height to unequal elevation when the toscarock was accumulating round the ventana and when with the exception of a few small rugged primary islands the whole wide surrounding plains must have been under water were the strata at monte hermoso depositing at the bottom of a great open sea between and feet in depth i much doubt this for if so the almost perfect carcasses of the several small rodents the remains of which are so very numerous in so limited a space must have been drifted to this spot from the distance of many hundred miles it appears to me far more probable that during the pampean period this whole area had commenced slowly rising and in the cliffs at several different heights we have proofs of the land having been exposed to seaaction at several levels and that tracts of land had thus been formed of pampean sediment round the ventana and the other primary ranges on which the several rodents and other quadrupeds lived and that a stream in which perhaps the extinct aquatic hydrochœrus lived drifted their bodies into the adjoining sea into which the pampean mud continued to be poured from the north as the land continued to rise it appears that this source of sediment was cut off and in its place sand and pebbles were borne down by stronger currents
