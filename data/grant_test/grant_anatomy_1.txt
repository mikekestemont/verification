outlines of comparative anatomy general observations on the osseous system of animals as animals are organized to select and obtain foreign matter for their subsistence and to convey it into their digestive organs to be transported with them from place to place they generally require some solid means of support for the attachment of their active organs of motion these denser parts of the body serve as a solid framework to give form and solidity to the whole fabric and to protect the more delicate organs they consist for the most part of earthy materials separated from the food by the vital processes of the animal and may be placed on the exterior or in the in terior of the soft parts these inert materials or passive organs of locomotion receive their forms from those of the soft parts and are liable to change with the varying condi tions of the contiguous living parts when placed on the exterior of the body they may without being organized keep pace with the progress of growth in the living parts by being periodically cast off and renewed or they may in crease by the addition of more extended layers to their surface or their dimensions may be continually influenced by the contact of the parts which formed them but when this solid framework is internal and is everywhere sur rounded by the soft parts giving attachment to muscles or enveloping and protecting delicate organs it cannot be con veniently removed from the system in a mass nor preserve its proportions by the mechanical addition of layers to its sur face and is generally organized or permeated in every point by the soft parts which absorb the decayed materials and re new them particle by particle the earthy materials thus formed by animals for the support of their soft parts are various and their particles are generally united together by means of a condensed albuminous or gelatinous matter which gives firmness and tenacity to the mass silica is found in the lowest forms of radiated animals carbonate of lime in the molluscous classes carbonate and phosphate of lime in the articulated animals and phosphate of lime in the organized skeletons of the vertebrata these earths in consolidating assume forms by the influence of laws which are in accordance with their ordinary physical properties this we observe most obviously in the lowest animals and least in the highest classes where the crystalline arrangement of the par ticles is most equivocal but under every condition they alike form a normal part of the structure a solid framework more or less complete constant in its form and structure in the same species and varying in its form with the speci fic differences of animals this solid framework forms the osseous system of animals or the skeleton as it has been termed from the dry and earthy nature of the materials which compose it the osseous system though not the most important nor the most universal system of animal or ganization is met with under some form in every class of the animal kingdom though not in all the animals of each class organs of support in the radiated or cyctoneurose classes the skeletons are as various as the forms of the animals in this lowest division of the animal kingdom and scarcely indicate in their composition or structure a determinate plan common to the whole they are sometimes external most frequently internal often composed of minute pieces sym metrically arranged or of one solid mass often of a thin flexible diaphanous horny consistence or composed of dense silicious or calcareous spicula or of masses of carbonate with a little phosphorate of lime the osseous parts in these classes appear to be extravascular and to grow by the juxtaposition of new portions and from the simplicity of the general structure and functions of these animals and the in ternal situation of their solid parts they are not exuvi able i polyyastrica many of the minute and soft polygastric animalcules possess an exterior firm elastic covering which protects the more delicate internal parts this covering sometimes consists only of a more condensed form of the common integument enveloping every part of the body in others it forms a distinct thin pellucid sheath into which the animal can withdraw its soft parts for protection the exterior surface even of the softest and most naked animalcules supports the organs of motion the minute vi bratile cilia by which they are carried to and fro and consists apparently of a thin film of the general cellular tissue of their body rendered more firm in its texture by the con tinued action of the surrounding element this condensa tion of the exterior integument is the origin of most of the skeletons of invertebrated animals which have generally the organs of support thrown over the surface of their body to afford them at the same time protection we have an example of one of these loricated animalcules in the volvox globator fig a so common in stagnant pools of fresh water and which often owe their green colour to the abun dance of this animalcule this sperical transparent green coloured tuberculated animalcule exhibits in its interior nu merous smaller round spotted and similarly formed beings moving to and fro as seen at a and the entire volvox does not change or vary its external form while it is seen swimming about slowly with the enclosed young when the exterior capsule or the parent animalcule bursts as is represented at b and the young have escaped we observe its fragments to retain their original form with some degree of elasticity when they are tossed about in the fluid by the motions of other animalcules we see the same transparent elastic integument giving form and support to the volvox morum fig c which contains a much greater number of young in its interior and the same is seen also enveloping the separate globules which compose the body of the gonium pectorals fig i d but the most distinct form of the skeleton met with in this class is that which envelopes the body as a sheath into which the animalcule can withdraw its soft parts when alarmed and from which it can extend its ciliated anterior portion for the purposes of nourishment respiration or progressive motion this vaginiform exterior thin pellucid elastic covering is seen in the vaginicola innata common in sea water this animalcule formed like a vorticella is seen in fig e extending its ciliated anterior margin from the opening in its sheath and swimming by the action of its cilia the same animalcule is represented at fig f with drawn into its transparent covering and fixed by its candiform projecting posterior part this form of the skeleton seen in the vaginicola leads to the vaginiform horny coverings of campanularue and other forms of keratophytes there are about thirty known genera of polygastric animalcules which possess a firm elastic exterior covering more or less envelop ing the body and analogous to the more solid skeletons of higher classes ii poriphera the skeleton of poripherous animals con sists of separate minute earthy crystalline spicula connected together by a condensed elastic cellular substance j or of tubular elastic filaments of a horny consistence these hard parts are developed internally throughout the whole cellular tissue of the body and are often protruded externally through the surface to protect the pores or the large vents the earthy spicula in most of these animals are silicious in many they are calcareous and like the horny filaments of other species they appear to be tubular like many natural crystals and to have no aperture leading into their internal cavity the spicula are generally united into fasciculi by an enveloping glutinous or condensed cellular substance and by the junction of these fasciculi in various modes fibres are formed which traverse every part of the body forming the boundaries of canals and orifices and giving form and sup port to the whole of the gelatinous or soft cellular substance of the animal the forms of these hard parts are different in every distinct species of these animals and they are con stant in the same so that they present useful characters for the distinction of species in this polymorphous class they are formed from materials due to the vital energies of the animal and they form normal and necessary parts of its structure like the solid skeletons of higher animals in fig is represented at a the haliclona occulata one of these soft animals with a silicious skeleton it is represented as alive suspended from a rock by its spreading branched base of attachment c the currents of water are seen at a rush ing in through the pores and issuing from the internal canals by the large orifices or vents at b the pores canals and orifices are seen exposed in the longitudinal section of the same poripherous animal at b fibres composed of bundles of spicula generally extend in a longitudinal direc tion in these animals from the base of attachment to the remotest points of the surface smaller transverse fibres of the same composition connect those which are disposed longitudinally and form the framework of the internal canals the form of the spicula which belong to several distinct species of poripherous animals are shewn in fig at c d e f g h i k l m each of these forms belong ing to a distinct animal and serving to characterize it the pores are surrounded with groups of spicula disposed in such a manner as to strengthen and protect the parietes of these minute orifices and to form a delicate network over the whole surface of the body as shewn on a magnified scale at o and a single pore is shewn at n still more magnified with its bounding and defending spicula and a delicate gelatinous net work which protects it from the entrance of small foreign particles floating in the water the silicious spicula are found in some of these animals while they are yet floating gemmules newly detached from the parent mass and seeking a suitable place to fix and develope one of these gem mules is figured at p highly magnified and broken to show the spicula already developed in the cellular substance of this minute embryo similar silicious spicula occur abundantly in plants with which these poripherous animals are the most nearly allied several of the animals of this class have the skeleton composed of calcareous spicula which have generally more complex forms than the silicious they are disposed in the same manner and for the same object through the in terior cellular substance of the body they impart a white colour to the whole body of the animals in which they occur they do not appear to occur along with silicious spicula in the same animal the skeleton is generally more loose and friable in the calcareous poriphera and the connecting gluti nous and cellular matter is less abundant one of these white friable calcareous poriphera the leuconia compressa very common in our seas is represented in fig at in form of a compressed lengthened sac suspended by its peduncle from any submarine substance the pores through which the currents are conveyed into this sack are seen all over the ex terior surface as at a a the canals are contained within the thickness of its parietes and the large vents or fecal orifices here open into the interior as seen where it is broken open at b the sac being open only at its pendent extremity d the whole of the inhaled water rushes incessantly out through that general aperture in the silicious skeletons of this class we find but one form of spiculum for each ani mal but in the calcareous generally two and one of these has a triradiate form as represented in fig at this triradiate form of calcareous spiculum is accompanied by one of some other form as by that clavate form of spiculum be longing to the leuconia compressa shewn in fig at the small spicula in fig at found in the same animal ap pear to be only fragments of triradiate spicula the tri radiate spicula chiefly bound the pores canals and orifices while the curved ends of the clavate spicula hang over the exterior entrance of the pores to protect them the cal careous spicula do not appear to occur in any of these animals along with silicious forms and the true horny tubular filaments appear also to occur alone in the more tropical species with out either silicious or calcareous spicula the calcareous forms of these animals appear to be much more rare and generally much smaller than the silicious or the horny species in the horny species of poriphera the skeleton consists of thin elastic tubular translucent filaments united together and distributed around the pores canals and vents these horny tough flexible threads have a close analogy in their mode of distribution through the whole interior of the body to the tough connecting matterof the spicula in the earthy species and they give form and support to the whole fabric sometimes the internal canal which extends through these tubular horny filaments is filled with an opaque matter which gives a greater friability to the threads but most frequently they contain only a transparent colourless fluid as we see in the fibres of the common officinal sponge which is a poripherous animal be longing to this horny group the skeleton of all the poripherous ani mals is so soft and flexible in the living state that none of the lengthened forms appear to be capable of growing in an upright position from their base of attachment they hang down from the under sur face of submarine bodies as represented in these figures a specimen of the common officinal sponge with a horny fi brous skeleton is repre sented in fig at as alive and cut from its point of attach ment c the circular minute pores by which the streams of water enter the internal tortuous canals are seen all over the surface as at a and the large vents by which the currents issue from the body are seen on the most prominent parts as at bb the manner in which the horny filaments are united to each other throughout the whole mass of the body is seen at fig where the broken ends of the fibres show their tubular character and this is still more magnified at fig the meshes formed by these horny fibres though apparently without order or regularity when the soft parts are removed have the closest relation to the pores and the tortuous canals which wind through every part of the body now we see in these simple skeletons of poripherous ani mals as in many vegetables still more remote from human organization that nature begins the formation of an internal framework for the support and protection of the soft parts by the deposition of detached earthy spicula throughout the cellular substance of the body as we see in the human em bryo the deposition of minute spicula of phosphate of lime in various parts of the soft gelatinous bones begins the con solidation of the skeleton the abundance of silicious needles in the skeletons of the lowest poriphera assists in their conversion into flint when their remains have been ex posed for ages in chalk or other strata traversed by silicifying percolations iii polypiphera the skeletons of zoophytes present a great variety of forms and characters being branched or globular or filiform free or fixed solid massive and calca reous or soft flexible and horny external or internal the animals of this class obtaining their food by polypi or highly organized sacs developed from the fleshy substance of the body we generally find the skeletons whether external or internal to present cavities or cells for the reception and protection of these delicate organs and the various forms of these cells constitute a principal distinction among the skeletons of this class the simplest forms of the skeleton are presented by the horny zoophytes or keratophytes where it sometimes consists of tough soft flexible filaments which surround the cells of the polypi throughout the whole mass of the body as in the alcyonium and lobularia these form a transition from the horny species of poriphera to the more distinct forms of keratophytes in the horny species of zoophytes the skeleton sometimes forms a tubular external sheath enveloping the fleshy substance throughout all the ramifications of the body as in all the sertularia plumularice antennularur and many other soft flexible and ramified forms the horny skeleton is sometimes formed by the deposition of successive layers within the fleshy substance of the animal as in the gorgonia and antipathes we have an example of an external tubular horny skeleton in the common campanularia dichotoma fig where we observe it enveloping as a sheath the fleshy substance which occupies the centre of all the divisions of the root the stem and the branch es the exterior horny sheath which is exuded upon the surface of the flesh is seen at a and this sheath expands at the extremities of all the branches to form cells b for the lodgment of polypi e i the base of attach ment spread out and ram ified like a root exhibits the same fleshy interior and the horny covering extended over all its divisions at c a magnified view of a small portion of a branch is represented at fig which shows the fleshy granular or cellular substance f in the centre surrounded by the tough elastic amber coloured skeleton exuded upon its surface in the axillae of many of the branches we observe large vesicles for the protection and development of the embryo these vesicles in the vagini form keratophytes are composed of the same firm pellucid substance as the rest of the skeleton and from the con stancy of their forms in the same animal and their differ ences according to the species they afford useful characters for the distinction of these animals they are deciduous parts of the skeleton as they fall off after the matured gem mules have escaped from their interior these gemmules are seen in little ciliated capsules at m m and the polypi are seen in the same figure extended in various attitudes from the cells in search of animalcules as food the skeleton of these vaginiform zoophytes often presents a jointed appear ance on the stem or branches as seen in the campanularia at these consist of circular indentations of the surface which do not pass through the interior of the body where they would interrupt the circulation of the nutritious fluid which passes through the fleshy substance in all parts of the body they allow of a certain degree of flexibility at the most suitable parts of the skeleton and in some of the horny cellariae they are connected with the deciduous character of the branches in the gorgonia and some other cortical zoophytes there is an exterior fleshy substance in the living state which covers all parts of the horny skeleton this fleshy exterior crust is indeed the animal which forms by the deposition of successive layers the whole of the flexible branched horny and solid internal skeleton if we make a transverse section of a thick portion of the gorgonia or antipathes we can easily perceive the concentric layers of which it is composed and by peeling off the cortical fleshy mass from the exterior and placing this living flesh in the sea we find it to secret a new internal horny axis for itself the polypi which are always and necessarily continuations of the fleshy substance of zoophytes are developed from this thick fleshy crust in the cortical kinds and hence we do not see any appearance of cells on the central horny axis in these animals after the flesh has been removed in the calcareous zoophytes the solid mass forming the skeleton is composed chiefly of the carbonate of lime with a little of the phosphate and the same condensed glutinous matter which forms the entire skeleton in the keratophytes is diffused through the whole of the calcareous mass in the more solid lithophytes where it serves to aglutinate the earthy particles and to give solidity and tenacity to the en tire mass the calcareous skeletons of lithophytes are for the most part internal massive and consisting of a single piece in madrepores and many similar forms the thin fleshy crust penetrates to a considerable extent the loose porous surface of the calcareous mass from which it is capable of receiving some protection and consequently we perceive distinct indications of the positions of the polypi on the surface of the skeleton in these animals these cells for the protection of the polypi have generally a radiated lamellar structure and vary remarkably in their size and also in their form in different lithophytes they are very minute in the porites larger in the madrepores still larger in the caryophyllia and the fungia agariciformis forms but one enormous cell for the lodgment of a polypus like an actinia in some of the lithophytes the fleshy crust as in the cortical kinds of keratophytes is of great thickness and the polypi developed from this fleshy exterior mass leave no indications of their position on the surface of the internal calcareous axis this is seen in the common red coral which is a solid internal calcareous skeleton striated with superficial lon gitudinal grooves but presenting no calcareous cells for the polypi which are protected solely by the fleshy thick covering of which they form parts in the agaricm mean drinte and many others we observe a laminated general sur face of the skeleton for the protection of the fleshy mass but no distinct cells for the polypi in the virgularm the skeleton consists of a straight internal calcareous solid cylindrical pillar occupying the longitudinal axis of the body and protruding from the lower part of the animal in the pennatula the internal calcareous axis is soft and flexible at its extremities from the abundant proportion of glutinous matter in its composition and to allow of the necessary con tractions and extensions of the animals body in a longitudi nal direction in the isis the internal solid calcareous skeleton is jointed at regular and short distances throughout the whole body and there are no external cells for the polypi which are entirely confined to the thick fleshy crust which covers the entire animal in the living state the joints here consist of the same glutinous tough matter which pervades the whole calcareous axis and are only uncalcified portions of the general solid axis they are formed by con centric layers like the calcified solid portions of the skeleton and they allow of considerable flexion in the branches and stem of this delicate ramified and highly organized animal as in most other classes of invertebrata we find many zoophytes which are destitute of an external or internal skeleton as the common fresh water polype or hydra be sides the solid internal skeleton in the corticiferous zoophytes we commonly find in the fleshy crust itself minute calcareous spicula these small spicula compose the hard crust which is seen covering the horny axis of the gorgonia as it is com monly preserved dried in cabinets and in their occurring thus spread through the general fleshy mass in gorgonue lobularia and many other zoophytes we observe a lingering analogy with the spicular form of the skeleton in the class of pori pherous animals especially in the calcareous group the skeleton in the keratophytes is exuded from the fleshy sub stance in a soft and semifluid state and quickly hardens after its separation from the living parts upon which it is moulded as the skeletons of zoophytes are not permeated by vessels or organized as it is termed their materials do not expand by growth but encrease in dimensions by the mechanical addi tion of new matter hence in the vaginiform keratophytes as plumularia and campanularice we find the base or lower part of the stem which was formed in the younger state of the animal to be smaller than the upper part of the stem which was formed of larger dimensions when the animal or the contained fleshy substance had encreased in bulk and de velopment the large globular masses ofmeandrince astrce and similar solid lithophytes encrease in bulk by the constant addition of new superficial layers of calcareous matter upon the same primitive plan by the polypherous fleshy covering of the mass from the origin and the mode of growth of these calcareous masses it is obvious that when torn from their primitive seat they may reattach themselves or con tinue to grow by the deposition or exudation of new matter as long as the secreting fleshy crust retains its vitality these extravascular skeletons appear to be very little modi fied by the contact of the living fleshy parts after they have been once deposited in a soft state portion by portion and fully consolidated by the hardening of the glutinous matter in the keratophytes or by the deposition of earthy matter in the more solid lithophytes it is by the contact of living membranes in the form of capillary vessels containing fluids that the decayed earthy particles of organized skeletons are removed and have new particles exuded in their place there are some skeletons of this class which retain an intermediate degree of conso lidation between the solid lithophytes and the horny flexible keratophytes as we see in theflustra and calcareous cetlaria where the proportion of earthy matter is very small com pared with the quantity of tough glutinous substance in their flexible skeletons and we observe them to be thin soft transparent and gelatinous all around their free and growing margins when these skeletons whether horny or calcareous have once been consolidated they are like the shells of articulata and mollusca or like the antlers of the deer no longer susceptible of growth and they enlarge or extend by the successive additions of new matter or of new parts the carbonate of lime is the common consolidating earth of zoophytes as silica is that of poriphera and these are two of the most abundant materials of the mineral kingdom by the abundance of these calcareous lithophytes on the shallow shores of the tropical seas they prepare a rich soil for new islands and continents to be raised by volcanic action from the deep while they at the same time tend to purify the mass of the ocean for the maintenance of higher animals by thus precipitating in an insoluble state the corrosive materials conveyed incessantly into its bed by rivers that wash the surface of continents the deep purple colours of the corrallium the tubipora the corallina and many others the azure blue of the pocillopora the bright yellow of the melitaa and all the other lively colours seen in these calca reous skeletons are removed by the action of heat and do not appear to depend on any peculiar mineral ingredient and we observe the same animal nature of the colouring matter in the shells of articulata and mollusca and in the coloured bones of many vertebrated animals these skeletons of zoophytes are not exudations from the surface of polypi the cell always precedes the existence of the polypus which is developed within it they are de veloped from the gelatinous substance of the reproductive gemmules before any polypi begin to be formed and they continue to be developed and extended by the fleshy mass of the zoophyte whether polypi are developed in the cells or not there is but one life and one plan of development in the whole mass and these depend not on the polypi which are but secondary and often deciduous parts but on the general fleshy substance of the body iv acalepha although there are no solid skeletons in any of the soft gelatinous free and floating animals of this class we generally perceive some firmer cartilaginous por tions of the body which afford support to the organs of pro gressive motion or of prehension there are crescentic car tilaginous lamine around the inferior central part of the body in the medusae which give support to the contracting fleshy overhanging mantle and to the absorbent tubes pro longed from that part there are firm superficial longitudi nal bands in most of the ciliograde acalepha for the support of those minute vibratile fins by the motions of which they are carried through the sea from the feebleness of their muscular system and from their swimming habits it is obvious that the acalepha can only support the lightest forms of the skeleton in the velella limbosa fig which floats on the surface of the sea there is a thin flexible per pendicular crest fig a which is covered with a thin layer of the deep blue coloured mantle and which rests obliquely on a horizontal stronger transpa rent flexible plate fig b the thin perpendicular crest which rises above the water and serves as a sail appears to be composed of the same condensed glutinous or horny substance which composes the skeletons of the keratophytes the horizontal plate is thicker concave below marked with concentric lines of growth and gives support to the deep blue mantle above to the delicate marginal tentacula seen at b b in both views of the velella to the numerous tubular suckers and to the stomach placed beneath this concave horizontal plate the porpita which is another of these floating acalepha presents a similar thin plate to this horizontal lamina of the velella for the support of the same parts but of a round form of a white colour and of a porous texture these two simple genera of acalepha present examples of the thin light and delicate forms of the skeletons which we find in almost all the floating marine invertebrata v echinoderma the skeletons of the animals of this class are generally in the form of external crusts or shells covered with projecting spines they are composed of the carbonate mixed with a small but variable proportion of the phosphate of lime and are hardened by animal matter the phosphate is always in a small quantity compared with the carbonate of lime but is more abundant in the solid shells of the echinida than in the softer coriaceous and tuberculated coverings of the stellerida the skeleton of all these animals consists of numerous detached or separate pieces which protect the interior viscera give attachment to the organs of motion and generally give form to the whole body the solid pieces which compose the skeleton are for the most part in form of calcareous plates symmetrical in their shape and in their arrangement and which present considerable uniformity of plan in their disposition throughout the diversified forms of this class the body most frequently presents a radiated form in the animals of this class the parts projecting in a stellular manner from around a longitudinal axis as is seen in the various crinoid animals fixed by a jointed peduncle and ramified above and in the various forms of existing stellerida as the asterias the ophinra the euryale and the comatula which are not fixed by a peduncle and we can easily observe the same plan of structure in the more con centrated and globular forms of the echinida as the scutellae the clypeasters the spatangi and the echini the radiating portions of these animals are composed of numerous rings or segments like the trunk and members of articulated animals and each of these component seg ments is surrounded by numerous calcareous plates one of these radiated or stellular forms of echinoderma is seen in the common asterias aurantiaca fig a where there are five rays or divisions of the body the number most frequent in this class on examining the sides of these rays from above as the animal is placed in the figure we observe the ends of large lateral plates fig a a a a which bound the margins of all the rays these plates are connected with others which surround chiefly the sides and lower surface above and presents an exterior surface marked by numerous tortuous grooves like the surface of a meandrina in its concave interior surface it protects a small membranous sac which contains a thick grumous matter chiefly composed of carbonate of lime with a little phosphate and was supposed by tiedemann to be the organ which separates from the fluids of the body the calcareous matter of the exterior covering the arrangement of the plates enveloping the segments is very similar to this in all the other forms of asterias how ever they may vary in the number of the rays and in the ophiurce where the rays do not contain prolongations of the digestive and generative organs and in the other forms of stellerida in the more compact forms of the echinida the skeleton is more solid contains more phosphate of lime and the component plates are arranged with more obvious symmetry the plates are arranged in perpendicular or longitudinal columns extending from around the mouth to the anus as is seen in the figure of the common echinus esculentus fig b which represents the entire shell as seen from above and deprived of its exterior spines some of these vertical columns are seen to be perforated with the same kind of small round oblique ambulacral holes as in the asterias these perforated ambulacral columns fig b are ten in number disposed two and two together so as to form five pairs the letters a a a point to the middle line of separation between each pair of ambulacral columns between these five pairs of small perforated columns are placed alternately five pairs of columns of larger tuberculated plates which are not perforated for the feet these tuberculated columns in pairs interposed between the successive pairs of ambulacral columns are seen in fig b at b and the line of separa tion between the tuberculated and the ambulacral columns is represented at c c the whole exterior of the shell being covered in the recent state with moveable spines attached to the tubercles we cannot perceive the arrangement of these vertical columns of separate plates till the spines are re moved or the shell is broken and viewed on the inner sur face a small portion of the shell of the echinus esculentus magnified and viewed from the inner surface where the ar of the rays and form the ambulacral grooves below for the tubular fleshy feet besides the tuberculated coriaceous irritable skin covering the upper or dorsal part of each small segment of each ray we can generally distinguish eight calcareous plates placed transversely on each segment and surrounding its sides and lower surface in the seastar represented in the figure there are eighty of these transverse divisions or segments in each of the five rays of the animal in all the segments of a single ray there are about seven hundred plates and about three thousand five hundred cal careous pieces in the segments of the whole animal the concave lower surface of each ray is perforated by numerous pairs of small oblique holes placed on each side of a longitu dinal median line which are the ambulacral perforations for the tubular fleshy suckers by which these animals drag themselves along the bottom of the sea or up the perpendi cular sides of rocks the lateral and dorsal parts of the segments often support fixed or moveable spines which grow like the plates themselves by the successive addition of calcareous layers from the thin fleshy secreting membrane which covers every part of the calcareous skeletons ofechino derma when we examine the fractured edges of these shells we observe the colouring matter of the surface to pass under the superficial tubercles which appear not to be continuous por tions of the plates to which they adhere by a broad spreading circular base the tubercles are few on the small terminal plates but numerous on the large pieces in the middle of the columns there are at an average at least ten tubercles for each tubercular plate and three tubercles for each of the tuberculated portions fig b b of the ambulacra plates every tubercle of the shell supports an external moveable calcareous spine so that there are more than ten thousand pieces in the shell of the echinus esculentus without counting the complicated dental apparatus of the mouth or the respira tory and ovarial plates or the very minute calcareous pieces disposed irregularly on the coriaceous membrane around the oral and the anal orifices there are five large heartshaped plates disposed around the anal aperture as seen in the central part of fig b each of which is perforated by a large round hole for the termination of one of the five oviducts between the tapering exterior ends of these five ovarial plates there are five smaller heartshaped plates each of which is likewise per forated with a small round hole around the lower orifice of the shell the last pairs of tubercular plates send in arched processes which meet each other over the ambulacral plates nud uive a fixed and extensive surface for the muscles of the dental apparatus the five teeth and their alveoli are repre sented as seen laterally at fig and as seen from above at fig there are five teeth fig a of a compact and dense texture where they project downwards from the alveoli and of a loose and fibrous structure at their upper part where they are enclosed in their complicated alveoli the alveoli fig b b are long slightly curved hollow tapering from above downwards moveable individually and collectively and held in connection by several distinct move able pieces fig b b y at their proximal extremities this dental apparatus which exists also in the cidaris is wanting in the spatangus and several other genera the exterior surface of the shell is covered in the echinida with solid calcareous spines which rest and move upon the round tubercles these spines are very large in the cidaris where the shell is small and they are small in the echinus and spatangus where the shell is large they grow like the other parts of the shell by successive deposition from the enveloping fleshy substance sec tions of these spines and of the tubercles on which they rest are represented in fig where represents the entire spine of the common echinus esculentus and a transverse section of the same spine in some of these external spines of echinida the growth appears to be effected by the addition of calcareous matter only to the proximal extremity or fixed ends of the spines the lines of growth do not then converge and meet in the longitudinal sections but diverge and terminate at the sides of the spines this structure is seen in the spines of the cidaris pistillaris represented in fig where a is the tubercle with a cavity at its summit as we commonly find in the animals of this genus b is the concave base of the spine with a cavity in its centre as in the tubercle on which it moves the compact portion of the spine formed within the capsule is seen occupying the middle of its whole extent and the successive layers of growth are observed extending from this central portion to the sides along the whole spine a view of the base of this spine is given at fig and a transverse section of its middle is represented at fig where we see the concentric layers of growth around the middle compact portion interspersed among the spines of the echini we find small fleshy cylindrical organs which ter minate in three moveable calcareous spines many of the echinoderma have no external skeleton and are covered only with a coriaceous irritable skin in the holothuria which are animals of this kind there are only five pairs of small calcareous pieces disposed around the mouth like the dental apparatus of the echini these pieces give support to the ramified tentacula and afford a firm attachment to the strong longitudinal muscular bands which encompass the body the animals of this great division have the trunk of the body for the most part long and cylindrical divided trans versely into segments and provided with numerous pairs of organs of motion symmetrically disposed along the sides from their activity their skeleton is generally in form of a light thin exterior enveloping condensed integument to the inner surface of which the muscles are attached through the medium of the cutis and which is periodically cast and renewed to allow of the growth and increase of the en closed soft parts the articulated appearance of the skele tons in these animals is generally proportioned to the density of its texture where the whole skeleton is soft and flexi ble there are few or no traces of articulations and where its texture is dense and unyielding the articulations are most distinct and complete hence in the helmithoid classes and in the young state of the entomoid animals the articulated appearance of the skeleton is less distinct than in the adult forms of the articulated animals with articulated members the tubular form of the hard enveloping parts of the arti culated animals and their unorganized nature require them to be exuviable and as they are thus the result of a single effort of formation they are always thin and light coverings they are not reinforced by successive deposits added to the surface through the whole of life as in the molluscous classes and consequently we find but little of that softer material the carbonate of lime employed in their consolida tion the more dense material of the phosphate of lime is almost always substituted for that earth as we see also in the vertebrated classes in some of the more solid and massive coverings however of these animals we meet with the carbonate of lime as in the serpula the cirrhopods and the crustacea vi entozoa the intestinal worms have for the most part a tough exterior transparent and almost hermogenous covering spread over their whole body to which they owe their peculiar stiffness and elasticity and to the inner surface of which their cutaneous muscles are attached this part is composed of the true skin and that epidermic covering which becomes consolidated into a dense exterior skeleton in higher classes it is here soft and elastic to allow them with more ease and safety to move through the tough and constantly moving parts of the living animals in which they reside the long cylindrical bodies of these parasitic worms would be impeded in their motions by any hard inflexible shelly covering which likewise could not be cast off and renewed in such a medium hence their smooth glisteningand unctuous covering has only that degree of density and toughness which is adapted to protect them from tearing and compression during the movements of the living parts around them this trans parent elastic tunic is especially thick and firm in the long cylin drical filiform or trematoid en tozoaas thejilariaihe strongylus the echinorhynchus and the as caris intheascaris lumbricoides which is represented in fig a this covering is thick and tough but so transparent as to allow the white layers of muscular fibres to be perceived through it the three moveable oral lobes are seen at the abdominal nerves are seen as a single line running along the middle of the ventral surface and separat ing to encompass the vulva at b and the anal opening is seen near the posterior termination of the body at d in the jointed teenies and bothriocephali this covering is soft and thin these being almost aggregates of simpler animals and it is still more thin and dilatible in the hydatids and caenuri this exterior covering often presents an irregular transverselycorrugated appearance during the contracted state of the long filiform antozoa which arises from the still irregular attachment of the interior interrupted longitudinal muscular fibres and these irregular transverse corrugations present us with the first condition of those joints and rings which become so regular and distinct in higher articulated classes this exterior soft covering of the entozoa presents us also with the lowest form of that cyclovertebral element which forms by its consolidation and repetition a series of calcified rings or segments around the exterior of the trunk in higher entomoid articulata and the solid bodies of the vertebrae in the redblooded classes in most of the inferior orders of entozoa there are numer rous dense conical recurved hollow and sharp pointed spines which are sometimes disposed as teeth around the mouth and sometimes are found covering a great portion of the anterior part of the body giving it the appearance of a file to abrade the surface on which they are to feed or through which they have to force their way these hollow spines are thus organs of progressive motion like the cirrhi and setse of annelides they are strongest and most numerous in the acanthocephalous species where they cover the whole of the retractile proboscis and sometimes as in the echino rhynchus hystrix nearly the whole of the anterior surface of the body there is thus a transition from these teethlike organs in the interior of the mouth and those covering the surface of the body in these soft worms which move through a fleshy resisting medium everywhere in contact with them to the lateral spines of the annelides which can be moved with more freedom and more precision through a thin aquatic or aerial medium as in the aquatic annelides and the earthworms the exterior covering is more dense in its texture and consequently more articulated in its appearance in those parasitic worms which are found attached to the exterior surface of the gills the lips the eyes and other soft parts of fishes and which have thence been called epizoa we already find in many of these animals as in the lerncea and chondrocanthi not only the head forming a distinct segment of the body and the trunk partially divided by transverse depressions but numerous appendices already developed from the sides of these segments and some of these appendices especially on the head provided with move able articulation this dense covering is still so transparent and hermogenous that we can distinctly perceive through it the longitudinal muscular fibres which produce the numerous corrugations of the skin and also the contained viscera the transition is quite imperceptible from these epizoa as the tracheliastes and the achtheres to the fixed parasitic entomostracous crustaceous animals as the ergasilus and the lamproglena where the exterior covering has the same texture and properties and where the articulated appearance of the trunk and its appendices is nearly in the same simple condition one of these lowest of the entomoid tribes almost inseparable from the epizoa the lamproglena pulchella is represented in fig b where we already observe the head and three principal divisions of the thorax distinctly marked as in insects we perceive in this little animal found attached to the gills of the cyprinus jeses two pairs of maxillae a a b b formed like curved pointed feet and two pairs of antennae c c d d as in higher crustacea above the mouth e are seen the two eyes united on the median plain as in higher monoculi and the intestinal canal is observed surrounded by the follicles of the liver and passing straight through the middle of the whole body as in most parasitic and carniverous articulata pairs of feet are seen extending from the sides of the segments and transverse fasciculi of muscular fibres i h k the unimpregnated ovaries closed above and filled with imperfectly developed ova which after wards descend to external sacs open on each side of the last distinct segment by a trilobate orifice m all the ex ternal parts of this very minute animal are developed nearly to the same extent and articulated to as great a degree in the achtheres and several of the higher of the acknowledged epizoa so that we have already developed in the lowest of the helminthoid classes the rudiments of all those character istic parts of the complicated skeletons of insects and of all the higher entomoid articulata vii rotifera the wheel animalcules are more closely allied to the helminthoid articulata than to any of the inferior radiated classes especially in their supra and infrasesopha geal ganlia their abdominal longitudinal nerves their dorsal vessel for circulation their lateral maxillae their highly deve loped genetal system and their muscular activity their exterior covering though generally thin and transparent as crystal appears to possess considerable firmness from the numerous powerful muscles inserted into it and from the transverse corrugations it presents when the body is drawn backwards to their fixed caudal extremity some times it is in form of a sheath enveloping the middle of the bodyand open both before and behind to allow the head and tail to be retracted and pro tected this firm tough elastic covering of the roti fera has some resemblance in its hermogenous texture to that of the entozoa and pro bably is persistent and en larges with the body there are no earthy deposits formed in any part of the body of these minute and active animals the densest parts of their body appear to be the two jaws which move trans versely by powerful muscles and are generally provided with numerous sharp teeth one of these wheel animal cules termed hydatina senta common in our ponds of fresh water is represented in fig where we perceive seventeen muscular lobes a a for the movement of the vibratile cilia disposed around the mouth the muscular apparatus b of the maxillae and the mouth are retracted by longitudinal muscles c which pass obliquely backwards and the whole body is forcibly retracted towards the fixed caudal extremity by several longitudinal bands d of muscular fibres which extend the whole length of the body the large central or supraeesophageal ganglion o is accompanied by four other ganglia disposed around the oesophagus and abdominal nervous filaments p are perceptible extending longitudinally on the inferior surface as in other articulated classes the muscular apparatus of the jaws may almost be regarded as analogous to the muscular stomach armed with teeth com mon in crustacea the narrow part of the intestine considered as the oesophagus g leads to a long and capacious digestive cavity which in many of the genera of rotifera developes nu merous caecal appendices like the biliary follicles of annelides in this capacious intestine extending from considered as the oesophagus to near the anus i on the dorsal part we observe small animalcules naviculce h which have been swallowed entire the longitudinal dorsal vessel e more like an abdominal nerve as in other articulata follows the median line and gives off numerous lateral branches in its course two glandular sacs appear to pour their secretions into the muscular cavity of the mouth as the liver into the muscular stomach of crustacea or the salivary sacs into the oesophagus of mollusca the two ovaria m form large lobed organs extending upwards on each side of the intestine and open by one orifice into the cloaca behind the rectum and two long narrow glandular sacs k k considered as testes pour their secretions into a large membranous vesicle situate behind the cloaca the jaws of this animal are represented apart from the body along with their enveloping muscular apparatus in fig where shows the serrated edges of the numerous teeth on each side of the open ing of the mouth the muscular apparatus of the jaws and c the general muscular sac of the mouth one of the jaws is represented at fig separated from the muscular sac of the mouth where the parallel teeth composing the jaw so variable in number in the rotiferous animals are seen at a and the insertions of the muscles at b sometimes only a single tooth on each side is seen to compose the jaws and they have been observed to vary in the number of component teeth in the jaws of different animals from one to six in each jaw thus their most solid parts relate solely to digestion and the lightness of their exterior covering corresponds with the constant and rapid movements of these rotifera through their watery element viii cirrhopoda the cirrhopods like the entomostra cous crustacea are articulated animals enclosed in shells like those of mollusca so that they present both forms of the skeleton they have six pairs of curled jointed mem bers extending from each side of the body from which this class has received its name each pair arises from a short thick fleshy peduncle and the peduncle or haunch of the anterior shortest pair those each side of the mouth support a pair of short pyramidal laminated branchiae like those attached to the haunches of the legs in most of the crustacea the feet are covered externally with a trans parent firm elastic integument are regularly and closely jointed to their finest extremity and are furnished with minute jointed cirrhi disposed along each side of their inner concave surface the trunk of the body between the feet is also partially jointed it presents the usual nervous columns and ganglia disposed along the ventral surface as in other articulated classes and as in them the intestine passes straight from the mouth to the anus which opens into a long thin flexible conical tube the mouth of these ani mals is furnished with an upper and a lower lip with a pair of mandibles and a pair of maxillae the maxillae are fur nished with small fleshy palpi and the lower lip is formed by the union of the exterior maxillae the cirrhopods are almost always inclosed in multivalve shells secreted from the outer surface of a fleshy thin enveloping mantle and which are attached to submarine bodies either directly by their base or by means of a fleshy tubular peduncle these exterior shells are generally thin laminated dense composed of carbonate of lime with animal matter and grow by the successive addition of layers to their inner surface the testaceous coverings are most developed in the balani where the articulated members of the contained animal are least and these exterior shells are least in the anatifa and other pedunculated genera where the feet are largest the acorn shells or balani form a hollow cone composed of six pyra midal pieces ribbed longitudinally with tubular cavities and overlopping each other in an imbricated manner by their thin margins these strong pyramidal plates striated in ternally both transversely and longitudinally rest their broad bases on the margin of a circular fixed calcareous disk striated in a radiated manner with small hollow tubes which open into those of the pyramidal plates between the su perior separated apices of these larger plates are interposed six smaller pyramidal pieces with their points directed downwards so that their bases complete the upper free and smaller margin of this truncated hollow cone the smaller inverted plates appear to be anchylosed to the larger inferior pieces within this fixed cone which has the means of continued increase by its subdivision into numerous pieces there are four moveable triangular plates two larger and two smaller which form an operculum to open and close at the will of the animal in the anatifa or pentalasmis represented in fig we have an example of the ordinary form of the skeleton in the barnacles or lepades suspended by a fleshy peduncle the shells here are thin and diapha nous and by their striated outer surface they mark the limits of the successive layers of growth and the opposite direc tions in which these lay fig ers are extended in the two lateral pieces of the shell fig represents the entire shell with the jointed members of the animal projectingfrom the aperture and a portion of the contracted pedun cle the jointed mem bers with their jointed cilia are here very long and are seen partially extended from the open anterior aperture b of the shell the pedun cle is composed of a tough exterior coriaceous tunic and an inner muscular coat so that it is capable of rapidly contracting when alarmed the dorsal shell e is the only piece placed on the median plain and grows by layers added to its inner surface and increasing successively from the proximal to the distal extremity the larger lateral pieces c c to which the animal is fixed by a strong transverse muscle of attachment as in bivalved mollusca grow likewise by layers extended from the whole of the distal margin the centre of ossification being at the proximal point the two distal smaller opercular pieces d grow from their distal to wards their proximal ends from their greater extent of motion by means of their long fleshy peduncle these le pades do not require to possess external shells so strong as the fixed sessile balani a dorsal view of the same shell on a more reduced scale is given in fig which represents the direction of the successive layers of growth of the dorsal plate which is analogous to the whole complex cone of the balani the four lateral moveable pieces representing the four valvular small pieces in the sessile species in fig the tubular peduncle is divided to show its outer coriaceous covering k and the inner muscular coat with the inter posed skin i and the right side of the shell is removed to show the inverted and curved position of the animal in its cavity in some of the pedunculated cirrhopods as the pouicipes there are several small supplementary calcareous pieces placed at the junction of the peduncle with the base of the shell and some as the cineras have only a cartilage nous or membranous covering unconsolidated by calcareous pieces the anterior part of the body fig of this enclosed animal as in most other articulata has less of the articulated appearance less distinct segments than the pos terior portion of the trunk and the skin of that anterior part is here thin and membranous the abdominal or posterior portion of the body fig b c is that tapering articu lated and free part from the sides of which the articulated cirrhated and pedunculated members project the muscles by which the anterior bulbous part of the trunk is attached to the valves of the shell are seen at y and the strong adductor muscle passing across from the right to the left valve and by which they are firmly closed when the animal is alarmed is seen at the six thick muscular peduncles for supporting and moving the six pairs of long articulated members on each side are seen at b c and the branchiae at tached to the anterior or smallest pair of these haunches are seen at h h the membranous conical long tube continued from the anus is seen extending from the shell at e these articulated organs of the cirrhopods attached to the sides of the abdominal portion of the trunk are in constant move ment during life extending and retracting like the branchial organs of the postabdomen in the branchiopodous crus tacea ix annelida the redblooded worms lead us a stage higher in the development of the articulated skeleton and especially in the organs of locomotion some as the
