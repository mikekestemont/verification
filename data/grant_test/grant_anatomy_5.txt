orbits approximate assume an anterior and parallel direction separated only by a narrow ethmoid and their communication with the temporal fossae is cut off by an osseous partition formed by the extension of the frontal and malar bones the temporal fossa be comes reduced in size the zygomatic arch short and straight the condyloid articulation of the lower jaw flat and free the lachrymal bone confined to the orbit and the nasal bones flat narrow short and often anchylosed together the intermaxillaries continue permanently separate up to the orangs and the incisors four above and below as in man continue more inclined forwards than in the human jaws the canine teeth as instruments of prehension and of de fence continue large and projecting and the sharp tuber cles of the molar teeth of the insectivorous and nocturnal makis become more short and rounded in the higher quad rumana correspond with the softer quality of their succu lent and juicy food the ramus of the lower jaw ascends higher and more abruptly and the coronoid process is re duced in length and strength the occipital foramen ad vances forwards on the base of the skull by the expansion of the posterior region and the occipital bone becomes con fined to the basilar aspect of the cranium the supraor bitary foramen is generally absent or a mere notch and the infraorbitary hole is commonly divided into several small apertures in the orangs the intermaxillaries anchy lose to the upper jawbones and to each other in the adult as in the human jaws the general forms of the bones and articu lations of the rest of the skeleton are adapted for the semierect or climb ing position of the trunk as seen in the skeleton of the mona monkey cercopithecus mona fig the cervical and lumbar and coccygeal regions of the column generally admit of free and extensive motion the cervical vertebrae have their spinous pro cesses simple and point ed the dorsal vertebrae nearly of the same num ber as in man and the lumbar vertebrae encreas ed in number at the ex pense of the sacrum the transverse processes more directed for wards towards the head than the human in these free and moveable lumbar vertebra in the prehensile tails of most of the american quadrumana the coccygeal verte brae are en creased in number and mobility and in the strength of their articulations they are generally more lengthened and cylindrical in the long tailed quadrumana of the old continent the scapulae are still lengthened and narrow but with an elevated spine the clavicles are strong and curved like the human the coracoid and acromion processes are of considerable size and the glenoid cavity comparatively deep the humerus is more curved than the human and the radius and ulna are more lengthened and slender and admit of very free pronation and supination there are often nine bones in the carpus by the division of one in the second row to give greater mobility and prehen sile power to the whole hand and for the same object all the bones of the metacarpus and the phalanges of the fingers which have the same number of bones as in the human hand are much lengthened the thumb is shorter and less opposeable to the other fingers than in man the pos terior members have the same long slender and prehensile character as the anterior the sacrum generally consists of three anchylosed vertebree the iliac bones are long and narrow and directed longitudinally and the tuberosity of the ischium expands outwards covered with the callosities on which these animals generally rest the femur is much curved its neck short and the trochanter major much ele vated the long slender and separate tibia and fibula admit of free motion in the foot as a prehensile organ and which is in creased by the shortness of the tuberosity of the calcaneumthe astragalus is twisted obliquely outwards and this inclination increased by the form of the calcaneum is communicated through the scaphoid and cuboid and the three cuneiform bones to the metatarsus and the whole foot which is thus made to rest obliquely on its outer margin and the inner toes are raised from the ground and left free for prehension the inner toe of the foot is here attached in a very oblique manner to the internal cuneiform bone which is placed much below the others and it is thus opposed slightly to the other more lengthened toes of the foot and that organ is converted into a prehensile hand in the highest of the quadrumana the chimpanze of africa the nasal bones are more raised from the face the incisors more vertical and the facial angle greater than in the inferior forms the scapulae and the iliac bones are more expanded the calcaneum extends more backwards and the forms and proportions of all the bones of the skeleton approach most closely to the human the forms of the bones and of the articulations of the human skeleton are adapted to support the trunk in a vertical position upon the feet by which the organs of the senses are directed forwards and the arms are left free for various employments by the great develop ment of his cerebral organs and the su perior elements of his cranial vertebrae fig the skull is large and its cavity capa cious the organs of the senses being con fined to a narrow space the face is small and it is nearly straight from the frontal hour to the chin from the slight projection of the muzzle excepting in the negro where the projection of the jaws and teeth and the receding of the frontal bone reduce the facial angle more near to that of the orangs the occipital foramen and the two occipital condyles are advanced further for wards on the base of the skull than in any of the quadrumana so that the head is more nearly poised by the centre of its base on the atlas and on the vertical column of the trunk the forehead and nasal bones and the chin project more than in the nearest quadrumana the incisors are more nearly perpendicular the canini shorter and the tubercles of the molares more rounded correspond ing with the softer condition of his food the squamous portion of the temporal bone the great ala of the sphenoid and the superior portion of the occipital are here more largely expanded the temporal fossa the zygoma and the coronoid process of the lower jaw are small the ramus of the lower jaw is larger and forms a more acute angle with the base the condyle is more elevated and convex and the glenoid cavity for its reception is deeper than in the quadru mana the nasal process of the superior maxillary and the lachrymal bone pass more into the orbit and the orbits are more parallel in their direction which gives greater preci sion to all visual impressions the vertebral column in the direction of the median plane has a greater sigmoid curva ture the cervical vertebrae have their spinous processes more broad short and bifurcated the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae extend more at a right angle from the bodies the sacrum is longer broader and more arched and the coccyx is comparatively small the ribs are more convex the sternum shorter and broader the clavicles are more curved and strong and the scapula is shorter and more expanded at its vertebral margin the glenoid cavity of the scapula is more lateral in its direction the humerus with a large articular rounded head is more straight the olecranon of the ulna is comparatively short and the bones of the thumb are more lengthened and more opposeable to the other fingers the pelvis is shorter and broader than in the inclined bodies of the quadrumana the iliac bones are more expanded and convex more extended over the acetabulum and with a longer crest the tuberosity of the ischium is less prominent and the symphesis pubis is shorter from the greater breadth of the pelvis the femora are more distant from each other their head has a less extensive articular surface and is marked by the ligamentum teres which is absent in the orangs the cervix femoris is longer and directed more obliquely downwards and the trochanter major is less elevated the bones of the legs stronger and more distant from each other afford a broad and secure base of support for the erect and weighty trunk and the strength of this base is encreased by the plantigrade position of the whole foot the parallelism and magnitude of the inner toe the advanced position of the astragalus the extension back wards of the tuberosity of the calcaneum the fixed condi tion of the tarsus and the strength of the metatarsal bones and the phalanges of the toes chapter second organs op attachment or ligaments the solid parts of the skeleton whether external or in ternal are held in connexion and are allowed to move on each other with more or less freedom by means of soft parts which are almost as inert in their vital properties as the bones themselves and this low degree of vitality better enables them to sustain the stretching and compression to which they are continually subjected even in the highest animals the ligaments which connect the bones and the cartilages which bound their contiguous sufaces are scantily supplied with bloodvessels and nerves and have a corresponding low degree of sensibility great slowness of growth and reproduction and great tenacity of life in the lowest tribes the component pieces of the skeleton are held together by the simplest mode of union they have not their points of contact protected by a layer of soft cartilage lubricated with synovia and connected by capsular ligaments and external ligamentous bands they are partially or entirely imbedded in a common tough connecting matter which by its elasticity admits of the few required motions no articulations nor ligaments appear in the soft gelatinous transparent bodies of the animalcules but in the poriphe rous animals the dense silicious and calcareous spicula which compose their solid framework are supported and maintained in their positions by a more tough elastic and firm portion of the general cellular tissue of the body perhaps stimu lated to condensation by the presence of these earthy crys talline bodies by the motions of the body produced by external bodies the points of these sharp spicula are made to project from this tough connecting matter in various directions from the gelatinous surface of the body from the margins of the pores or into the internal canals the tubu lar filaments in the horny species anastomose with each other freely throughout the whole body like the continuous connecting matter in the earthy species the jointed ap pearance seen in most flexible tubular keratophytes as ser tularia plumnlaria campanularia is confined to the exterior covering and does not interrupt the course of the fluids circulating through the enclosed fleshy part these thinner portions and annular strictures of the horny covering allow of the more ready development of new branches cells or vesicles and of the incessant movements of all their parts produced by the everrestless sea the branches of the cellaria thuya drop off regularly from below upwards along the stem at these apparent joints the minute calcareous spicula of many corticiferous and fleshy zoophytes as gor gonia and lobularia are connected by the general cellular substance of the body the black flexible elastic matter deposited in concentric layers between the calcareous inter nal solid pieces of the isis hippuris are merely uncalcified portions of the common animal matter which pervades the whole skeleton and connects all its earthy particles they are like the uncalcified portions of corallines but are secreted as the calcareous matter of the skeleton by the enveloping fleshy crust the exterior sharp spines of pennatulte are connected and moved by the coriaceous irritable skin of the body the skeletons of zoophytes as those of higher tes taceous animals are insinuated into the minutest inequalities of the surface of rocks and thus adhere firmly by being exuded in a soft semifluid state and then condensing the cartilaginous internal reticulate filaments of many alcyonia are continuous like those of horny poriphera throughout the whole body broken fragments of the solid skeletons of zoophytes are readily reunited by the exudations from the fleshy substance of similar ossific matter around the broken extremities as we see in the testaceous extravascular coverings of higher classes the delicate vertical crescentic lamina of the velella is continuous with the more thick horizontal plate on which it rests and is not detached by maceration the moveable lateral solid plates of the stel lerida are connected both by irritable and ligamentous bands as are also the solid jointed moveable spines frequently developed on their upper surface the plates composing the shells of the echinida are united by harmonic sutures and the spines are united to the tubercles by the enarthroid form of articulation where there are marginal muscles an exterior capsule and generally a round central ligament like the ligamentum teres of the femur as in the cidaris and spatangus the unconsolidated portions of the general cuticular exudation form the means of connection between the dense external parts of the trunk and its appendices in the helminthoid and in the entomoid classes of diploneura this we already find in the segments of the trunk and of the rudimentary antennse of some of the higher epizoa in the tough epidermic membrane connecting the pieces of pedunculated cirrhopodous shells and in the segments and cirrhi of the same animals and of many of the higher an nelides in the more solid skeletons of the entomoid classes the calcified coverings of the segments of the trunk and of the antennse and palpi are partially retracted within each other and are connected by numerous muscles and by the true skin and its continuous thin epidermis the other appendices developed from the sides of the body present chiefly the ginglimoid forms of articulation without the aid of ligaments where one portion of the skeleton is locked into another and where the motions of the joints are very secure but limited in extent these forms of the articula tions w r e see especially in the strong members of the larger crustacea and coleopterous insects the valves of con chifera are connected together both by the teeth of the hinge which are often locked into each other as in spondy lus and by the tough extravascular ligament which grovs by successive layers of epidermic matter and constantly tends by its elasticity to separate the two valves between which it is placed the eight transverse plates composing the shell of the chitons have generally a strong coriaceous ligamentous band connecting their margins and secreted like the ligaments of conchifera by the surface of the skin the byssus of conchifera consists of horny filaments se creted in a fluid state by a gland behind the base of the foot they are conveyed along a median groove of the foot to be attached to external solid bodies to anchor the more delicate shells as pinna and other mytilacious bivalves the horny operculum of most of the testaceous turbinated gasteropods is of a condensed albuminous nature secreted in successive superimposed layers added to the attached surface by the muscular foot to which it adheres in the same manner as the retractor muscle adheres to the columella of the shell from the ginglimoid hinge of the shells of conchiferous mollusca admitting only of flexion and extension in one direction few though powerful muscles are required to effect their motions but the joints of the articulated classes of animals being generally formed by a segment of one sphere being enclosed within another and consequently ad mitting of rotation in every direction numerous muscles are required to effect their varied movements the ginglimoid crural joints of the entomoid classes being formed by hollow cutaneous solid tubes have generally one very strong and broad flexor tendon and a more narrow and feeble extensor tendon into which all the muscles of the joint are inserted and they are deeply excavated and covered only by the unconsolidated thin tough epidermis and skin on the side to which the joints are inflected there are no opercula or moveable pieces of the shells in the pteropoda or cephalo poda and the soft cartilaginous organized internal bones of the cephalopods are connected only by muscles and by thin unconsolidated portions of their own soft matter in the soft flexible cartilaginous skeletons of the lowest cyclostome fishes there are scarcely any traces of articula tions or ligaments and in the higher chondropterygii they are almost confined to the most moveable parts connected with mastication and the fins for progressive motion in fishes as in the inferior classes where the skeleton becomes more consolidated by earthy depositions the articulations and ligaments become more developed and distinct the vertebral ligaments of osseous fishes are white fibrous and dense in their texture and by their elasticity they bring back forcibly the vertebral column to the straight position when it has been drawn to either side by the lateral strata of muscles the moveable intermaxillary palatine and superior jaw bones are connected by a tough fibrocartilagi nous membrane as well as by muscular attachments the moveable articulations of fishes are mostly effected by a tough interposed cartilage which envelopes the contiguous ends of the bones this substance is much softer than the corresponding fibrocartilaginous parts of higher classes and is more readily dissolved by boiling water in place of the interposed elastic sacs between the cuplike cavities of the vertebrae of fishes or the firm connecting layer of fibro cartilage between the vertebrae of mammalia we find the bodies of the vertebrae of reptiles united by distinct move able articulations or enarthroses with strong capsular liga ments and synovial secretion and many of the vertebrae of birds especially of the neck are united by the same free and secure articulations in the amphibia and in the rep tiles most of the articulations are constructed on a simpler plan than in the warmblooded classes there is yet no in terarticular cartilage between the condyle of the lower jaw and the temporal bone nor a ligarnentum teres between the femur and the cotyloid cavity but the articular surfaces of the long bones are covered with smooth and firm carti lage are lubricated with synovia and are enclosed in strong capsular ligaments the articular processes of the vertebrae have here their synovial capsules and the spinous processes their interspinal ligaments the articular cavities of the joints are less deepened by cartilaginous margins the inter nal loose cartilages of the joints are more rare the exterior ligamentous bands are more simple in their arrangements and there are fewer immoveable synarthroses than in birds and mammalia the capsular ligaments are thinner and of a more dense texture in birds than even in mammalia and more synovia is poured into the joints especially of the neck and extremities on account of the extent and rapidity of their movements and the high temperature of their body each end of the tympanic bone is here enveloped in its synovial capsule although most of the cranial bones have lost even their connecting sutures and most of the vertebrae have their bodies united by free and secure synarthroses less pressure being exerted on the joints in the light bodies of birds than in the heavy bodies of mammalia there is a much thinner layer of elastic cartilage on the contiguous ends of their bones than in quadrupeds and from the light ness of their head as in other oviparous vertebrata com pared with that of most quadrupeds they have no necessity for a ligamentum nuchae to support it the thick firm elastic layer of fibrocartilage interposed between the flat bodies of the vertebrae of quadrupeds is the mode of arti culation which best corresponds with the strength and the slow and limited motions required in that region of their skeleton the synovial capsules of the articular processes of the vertebrae are more developed in the active trunks of carnivorous and of climbing mammalia than in the more weighty and motionless bodies of pachyderma and rumi nantia the long anterior and posterior vertebral ligaments are of great strength and elasticity along the pliant columns of cetacea without and within the spinal canal and in the long and pliant tails of many quadrupeds we find the highly moveable bodies of the coccygeal vertebrae united by syno vial capsules to facilitate their motions the heavyheaded herbivorous quadrupeds have the ligamentum nuchee of great size and strength extending from the occipital protuberance along the spinous processes of the dorsal and often of all the succeeding vertebrae to the coccygeal sending a pair of laminae downwards to be attached to each spinous process in the lightheaded and muscular car nivorous species this ligament is very small and generally extends forwards only to the large spinous process of the axis and in many of the most active rodent and quadruma nous mammalia no trace of this cervical ligament is per ceptible in the strong extremities of heavy herbivorous quadrupeds where limited motions and secure articulations are required the capsular ligaments are less loose and elastic than in the carnivora where greater freedom and extent of motion are necessary and greater force of action strong transverse ligaments pass in the elastic feet of rumi nating quadrupeds from the one penultimate phalanx to the other to prevent the tearing of the two toes asunder during their rapid and bounding movements which are not com patible with the extensive movements of the toes of carni vorous species in the slowmoving extremities of the ele phant the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus there is no ligamentum teres to fix the head of the femur to the cotyloid cavity nor do we find it in the kangaroo the sloths or the monotrema nor in the sedate orangs which so much ap proach the human species chapter third on the muscular system or active organs of motion first section general observations on the muscular system the movements of animals are effected by the muscular system the most remarkable and essential property of which is the power of contracting with rapidity and force on the application of stimuli the fibrous structure is not a constant character nor essential to the irritability of this system although that vital property is greatest in all the higher classes where this structure prevails these irri table fibres appear to consist of lineal aggregates of fibri iious globules the union of which is most intimate where the contractile power is greatest the cohesion of these globules is least where all lineal arrangement is lost in the lowest tribes of animals in which the slowly irritable fleshy substance appears as a soft homogeneous cellular tissue the muscular system effects all the locomotions of animals and all the movements of their organs of relation and forms a constituent part of all the active organs of vegetative life so that the consideration of many parts of this system is inseparable from the history of particular organs the contractity of the muscular fibre is intimately connected with the extent of respiration in animals being feeble in the radiated and molluscous tribes where the respiration is small and more energetic in the articulated classes where the respiration is greater and generally aerial and for the same reason it is less powerful in the imperfectly aerated reptiles than in the feathered tribes where the air permeates every region of the body it is by means of this system that animals are enabled to move to and fro to seize and masticate their food or to convey it through their alimen tary cavity to circulate their fluids through the body to force all discharges from their system to bring the surround ing element into contact with their blood to produce various sounds for mutual intercourse and to vary to infinity the outward form and expression of their body the different parts of this great and complicated system can therefore be classified and arranged according to the functions to which they are most subservient the movements of voluntary muscles appear to be accompanied with a distinct perception of their active state and to become associated with feelings of the mind so that they chiefly belong to the organs of relation or the functions of animal life while those of the involuntary muscles unaccompanied by sensations and more independent of the rest of the body are chiefly connected with the organs and functions of vegetative life in most muscles the component fibres run parallel to each other with numerous minute nervous fibrils and capillary bloodvessels running in the same longitudinal direction between them and freely anastomosing to produce a complicated network throughout the whole texture although the muscular fibres are organs distinct in their whole course they are united into fasciculi and these into entire muscles by means of cellu lar tissue and they are generally inserted into strong tough fibrous tendons which are less supplied with nerves and bloodvessels than the muscles themselves and are destitute of irritability the muscles of the highest classes of red blooded animals during their development pass through the soft colourless homogeneous and gelatinous condition of those of the lowest animals before they assume the red colour the dense fibrous structure and the highly irritable and contractile property which they possess in their mature form second section organs of motion in the cycloneurose or radiated classes although the aid of the microscope has not enabled us to detect muscular fibres in the transparent and active bodies of the polygastric animalcules most of them exhibit distinct signs of lively irritability in contracting bending and stretch ing their whole body or its anterior prehensile part and they are carried rapidly to and fro in their dense element by the rapid vibration of minute cilia generally disposed in regular series on their external surface the cilia are the organs of respiration as well as of locomotion in these animalcules and they are generally longest and largest on the anterior part of the body especially around the mouth and in the flat forms as the cyclidium the long cilia form a vibratile zone around the inferior margin of the body where the ante rior part of the body is obliquely truncated as in many of the kolpoda the vibration of the cilia gives a revolving mo tion to the whole body in its progression in most of the trichodae and paramtecia the cilia are disposed in regular close longitudinal series extending over the whole outer surface of the body and of the greatest length around the oblique mouth the vorticella have two rows of cilia dis posed around their anterior circular extremity the cilia have been observed in almost every class of animals from the polygastrica to the mammalia and both on the surface and in the interior of the body but the means by which they are moved have not been detected no cilia have been seen in the spermatic animalcules which are extremely minute and are moved by the lateral motions of their slender tail like tadpoles which implies greater irritability and muscular development than in the ordinary polygastrica the action of vibratile cilia is always so much independent of the will or connection with the rest of the body that it continues for some time after the part to which they are attached has been severed from the animal and this is observed even in those of adult birds and quadrupeds jaws containing sixteen teeth have been detected in the loxodes cucullulusy which necessitate great muscular development in this minute polygastric animalcule the soft cellular tissue which pervades the whole fibrous texture of poripherous animals and lines their pores canals and vents does not exhibit distinct signs of irritability or contractility when acted on by the strongest stimulants and the currents continue to be impelled rapidly through these passages even in thin portions cut from the body it is probable therefore that the currents are produced solely by means of cilia which are numerous and large over the sur face of these animals when in the state of gemmules newly detached from the parent the ciliated free gemmules of poriphera do not exhibit signs of irritability by contracting their body and changing their form like those of zoophytes the cellular substance of the poripherous animals being still of a soft and semifluid consistence is incapable of effecting any perceptible movements in the fibrous skeleton which it permeates the general fleshy mass of the body possesses distinct though languid irritability in almost all forms of zoophytes although the fibrous structure is seldom developed in any part this property is manifested in the lobidaria by the spontaneous slow contraction and dilation of its body at different periods of the day by the influence of temperature and light or by the slow contraction of a part of the body which has been touched or irritated this fleshy contractile part is the same which secretes the solid matter of the skeleton in this class and developes the po lypi from different parts of its surface the relation of this irritable and secreting part to the internal axis in the corti ciferous zoophytes is seen in the section of the isis hippuris fig b where the calcareous solid portions and the flexible elastic ligamentous parts b occupy the centre of the fleshy substance c and the cells of the polypi d d are seen to be here confined entirely to this irritable crust and to leave no impression on the axis the polypi are the most irritable and contractile parts of the body in all zoo phytes and the most exquisitely sensitive to external im pressions the polypi are prehensile sacs or mouths deve loped from and continuous with the fleshy substance of zoophytes their margin is surrounded with delicate fleshy arms or tentacula which vary in different species from six to more than thirty the polypi are seen extended from the fleshy substance of the isis in fig a d d the fleshy part covers the branch at c and is removed from the jointed skeleton at a b b the fleshy part of the isis appears to be incapable of bending the joints of the skeleton and it has as little effect on the skeleton in the other corticiferous zoophytes where it forms thin laminae consolidated with calcareous matter and disposed around the parietes of cells as flustrce eschara and cellarice it is as little capable of moving the axis in the cellaria loriculata fig c where the cells of the polypi a a are disposed in regular consecutive pairs with their apertures opposite and with contracted articulations c c at the bases of the cells neither the enclosed polypi nor the fleshy part of the entire animal are capable of bending the articulations the slow contraction of the pennatula phos phorca coils up the thin flexible extremities of its calcareous axis and moves the retroverted spines of its exterior surface so as to push the animal slowly along a rough surface in the vaginiform zoophytes the internal currents of the body are not produced by the contractions of the internal fleshy parietes though compared by cavolini to a heart but by the action of vibratile cilia and the open base of the polypi often con tracts as if by a movement of deglutition the polypi being the organs by which the food is attracted seized and digested and the surface of the body aerated they possess the most complicated structure and the highest vitality the tentacula surrounding the mouth as in the flustra carbesia fig d have generally minute vibratile cilia disposed along their sides by the action of which currents of water conveying animalcules and other food are directed towards these prehensile and digestive cavities in these compli cated and highly irritable polypi of the flustra we perceive numerous muscular bands fig c connecting the lower part of the polypus with the aperture of the cell and others passing from the same part of the polypus downwards to connect it with the bottom of the cell e the vibratile cilia move the currents outwards along one side of each tentaculum d and inwards along the other side and they are generally vi sible only while they move in the di rection of the currents which they produce that is in their forward stroke when in full activity the cilia are in visible in their backward movement from the velocity with which they resume their position to commence a new stroke forward and as vibratile cilia are thus generally perceptible only in their slow forward impelling move ment they have some resemblance to a stream of globules flowing always in one direction there are about fifty cilia on each side of a tentaculum in the flustra carbesia and nearly forty millions on a moderate specimen of the entire animal in many zoophytes they are much more numerous so that these fixed and plantlike animals though possessing a very low degeee of irritability in their general mass are well provided with active organs to bring their food towards them and to renew the stratum of water in contact with their surface for the purpose of respiration the vibratile cilia are generally disposed around the mouth of the polypus where the cilia of the tentacula themselves are not vibratile but merely lateral extensions of these prehensile organs the naked hydrae are irritable and contractile in every part of the body and their texture ap pears cellular throughout without any distinct muscular fibres the fibrous structure is partially developed in the irritable parts of some of the larger and more complicated polypi as those of the pennatula virgularia and lobularia y and they form distinct longitudinal and sphincter bands in the actinia and in the polypi of some of the larger litho phytes as fungiae explanaria and car yophy ilia which so much resemble fixed actiniae many of the acalepha swim like animalcules by the movement of external longitudinallydisposed vibratile cilia these cilia are large and generally visible by the naked eye and are distinctly supported by parallel rays like the fins of a fish but the muscular apparatus by which they are so rapidly vibrated is not perceptible from the development of the nervous system and even of eyes con taining a crystalline lens seen in some of the animals of this class it is probable that the parallel fibrous striae per ceptible in the highly contractile mantle of medusae are of a muscular nature the long tentacular filaments which we so frequently find developed from the periphery of the man tle possess a high degree of irritability and are exquisitely sensitive the muscular development is less required in the hydrostatic or physograde species which are supported at the surface of the sea by an airbag or a sac filled with a gaseous secretion due to its own parietes the large pecti nated cilia of the ciliograde acalepha have the same kind of rapid vibratile motion as the minuter forms of these organs seen in zoophytes and animalcules and they continue in the same manner their movements independent of the rest of the animal in parts severed from the body the fixed crinoid echinoderma appear to move their numerous calcareous articulations by the exterior irritable and secreting fleshy covering which envelopes all parts of their body in the free stellerida the nervous and the mus cular systems are already obviously developed and eyes are observed on the asterias the segments of many of the stellerida are connected together and moved by muscular bands which are distinctly fibrous and both longitudinal and circular fibres are seen on the highly irritable and con tractile feet which extend from the ambulacra the same muscular structure is seen in the long tubular prehensile feet of the echinida where the segments of the trunk are im moveably united by harmonic sutures strong adductor and abductor muscles are seen attached to the moveable pieces of the jaws in many of these species and strong muscular fasciculi pass from around the base of the external spines to the periphery of the tubercles on which they move in the naked holothurige the tough exterior coriaceous covering is highly irritable and contractile these animals are provided with five crowded longitudinal rows of the usual tubular muscular prehensile feet extended like those of other echinoderma by the injection of water into their median cylindrical cavity their dental apparatus is provided with its muscular bands and the five larger of these osseous plates around the mouth give attachment to five strong lon gitudinal muscular bands which extend beneath the skin to the posterior extremity of the body muscular system of the diploneurose or articulated classes the development and energy of the muscular system are greater in the articulated than in the radiated or even the molluscous classes which corresponds with the greater ex tent of their respiration and with the higher condition of all their other organs of relation in the subcutaneous mus cular tunic of the nematoid entozoa we already perceive the longitudinal and transverse short interrupted filements which are more symmetrically arranged into bands and muscles where the segments of the trunk are more consolidated and distinct in higher classes in the outer layer of this mus cular coat the short interrupted and interlacing fibres have a transverse direction and those of the same kind forming the inner layer have a longitudinal direction and are generally grouped to form four lengthened contractile bands the longitudinal fibres compose distinct muscles especially at the anterior part of the body where they are attached to the moveable parts of the mouth the muscular fibres are not perceptible and the irritability is most feeble in the cystoid and cestoid forms of this class the long pliant organs of attachment by which the entomoid forms of these entozoa adhere to the surface of aquatic animals present generally distinct longitudinal muscular bands as we see in lerna and they are also developed for the movement of the maxillae and other dense and articulated parts of their body the muscular apparatus is most distinct and complicated in most of the rotiferous or wheel animalcules and cor responds with the high development of their nervous and other important sytems there are numerous fasciculi at the anterior part of the body for the movement of the long vibratile cilia which surround the mouth the maxillae are enveloped and moved by a strong muscular apparatus which can be deeply retracted within the body by longitudinal bands and similar longitudinal bands extend along the whole internal parietes of their body for the retraction and bending movements of the trunk the muscles of these animals though most distinct are almost as colourless and transparent as the crystalline parietes of their body they are carried through the water by a slow and gliding movement produced by the rapid vibration of the long cilia which surround the anterior parts of their body and these cilia while in action appear like a revolving wheel from their forward slower and more forcible movement being alone perceptible by the eye the currents of water and the surrounding particles move in the same direction in which the circles appear to revolve in the cirrhopods we find united in the same animals both the articulated and the molluscous forms of the mus cular system and these are accompanied with a fixed con dition of the exterior shell and a high activity of the enclosed animal the peduncle and the mantle present distinct musclar fibres the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity near the head is attached by several muscular fasciculi to the mantle and the shell and a strong adductor muscle as in bivalves passes straight across from one moveable piece to the opposite the fleshy parietes of the abdominal cavity the conical tubular funnel prolonged from that cavity and the haunches and innumerable tubular articulations of the cirrhi present distinct muscular fasiculi in the pedun culated forms as in the pentalasmis the whole of the con vex dorsal part of the enclosed animal is covered with crossing muscular fibres which pass off in numerous sepa rate fasciculi to be attached to the inside of the proximal or closed part of the enveloping multivalve shell these draw the animal forcibly and quickly back into the shell after its body has been protruded for respiration or for food the haunches of the jointed members and the base of the funnelshaped tube also receive distinct muscles from this fleshy dorsal part of the cirrhopod for their varied movements the annelides generally present a distinct muscular tunic of a complicated structure immediately beneath the outer tough and annulated integument and intimately united to it besides the muscular fasciculi appropriated to the motions of the lateral setae and cirrhi which extend from muscular sheaths this subcutaneous muscular tunic is resolvable into distinct layers and each of these into in numerable separate fasciculi the most exterior of which have generally a transverse or an oblique direction and the most interior a longitudinal course as seen in the same part of the entozoa these longitudinal muscles are more or less distinctly divided into longitudinal bands as those of the nematoid entozoa and as we see even in the holothuria the actinia and many other of the radiated animals this muscular tunic of the annelides appears to act on the interior viscera as well as on the external imperfectly developed segments its exterior layer is some times double the one portion consisting of oblique fasciculi and the other of tranverse and both of these exterior to the usual internal layer of longitudinal fasciculi the several muscles are disposed similarly in the different seg ments of the same worm and even in different worms in the larvae of insects in myriapods and in the segments of the trunk of most of the articulated classes of animals in the common earthworm as in many others the mus cular sheaths for the extention and retraction of the short conical curved and pointed feet consist chiefly of radiating fibres which extend from around the base of these hollow spines the fleshy lips of this animal are provided with several longitudinal and circular muscles appropriated to their varied movements and the anus is distinctly furnished with levator and spincter muscles from the aerial respiration and the higher general de velopment of most of the entomoid articulata their mus cular fibres are more dense and irritable and from the greater consolidation and distinctness of their segments their muscular fasciculi are more isolated and more me thodically disposed than in the softer trunks of the aquatic helminthoid tribes the myriapods like the worms having their segments and their lateral appendices equally developed from the one extremity of the trunk to the other without distinction of thorax and abdomen present the greatest similarity in the muscular system throughout all their seg ments and the greatest resemblance to the disposition of that system in annelides and in the larvae of insects more than four thousand distinct muscles are found in the larva of the common cossus ligniperda and these are disposed in con centric strata the fasciculi of which are directed some longi tudinally some transversely and others with various degrees of obliquity passing as in the trunk of most adult entomoid animals from the concave inner surface of one segment to the anterior enclosed margin of the next succeeding as the extremities and wings for progressive motion become deve loped from the thorax the muscular apparatus of that por tion of the trunk becomes more developed than in any other segments in the annexed figure from straus representing the principal muscles of the trunk of the male cockchaffer melolontha vulgaris fig we observe that the interior layer of muscles of the segments of the abdomen run in a longitudinal direction like those of the helminthoid classes the muscles of the abdominal segments consist generally of parallel short fasciculi which retain the same breadth and form from their origin to their insertion but in the anterior part of the trunk where the movements are more powerful the muscles have generally a conical form being broad at their origin and tapering towards their point of insertion so that more muscles can be inserted into a limited point to strengthen and vary its movements this form is seen in the depressor muscle a of the head and in the lateral flexor of the same part the fasciculi of the rotator d of the head are more parallel but they converge to a point in the two portions of the levator capitis e y and in the inferior c and the superior f retractor of the corselet the levator a of the corselet and the levator obliquus h of the jugular piece the fasciculi are more parallel in the large and powerful depressor muscle i of the wing on which the flight of the insect so much depends and also in the several portions of its broad levator muscles k the same tapering and pointed form is seen in most of the muscles in the region of the pelvis or attached to the moveable pieces of the anus as in the strong levator n of the inferior anal piece the retractor preputii y the posterior retractor of the inferior anal piece and the retractor of the cloaca o there is also great uniformity observed in the disposition of the flexor and extensor muscles in the ginglimoid articulations of the legs in all the entomoid classes and in the more moveable rotating articu lations of the antennee and palpi of these animals the muscles of the trunk in these highest articulated classes like those of the helminthoid forms are still divided into bands which occupy chiefly the dorsal and the ventral aspects of the body and these are again partially divided on the median plain by the dorsal vessel above and the nervous columns below and here as in the vertebrated classes we observe that these symmetrical and voluntary muscles do not cross the median plain of the body they are connected through the medium of the skin to the solid coverings of the segments so that the exuviable skeleton is cast off in all these entomoid classes without affecting the insertions of the muscles into the true skin in the air breathing pulmonated and tracheated arachnida we find the same dense irritable and serrated character of the muscular fibres as in the perfect insects a similar structure of the muscles and their tendons and the same general disposition of these organs where the articulations resemble their capaceous cephalothorax is occupied chiefly with the large and strong muscles of the haunches of their numerous long legs and with those of their masticating and poisonous appa ratus the long cylindrical segments of the postabdomen of the scorpions are chiefly occupied with the powerful muscles appropriated to the movement of the poisonous sting formed by the last segment of the trunk the tendons of the muscles here as in insects and crustacea are only calcified prolongations from the exterior skeleton the muscular system of the crustacea forms a larger proportion of their body than in the airbreathing articulata and their move ments are more rapid and powerful than in almost any other branchiated invertebrata their individual fibres however are softer more white and pellucid less compact in their texture and less irritable and strong than in the pulmo nated or tracheated classes and they require less muscular force on account of the support which they receive from the density of the element through which they move the muscular apparatus of their external organs of mastication and of locomotion closely resembles that of insects but their stomach is covered with powerful muscles for the movement of the internal teeth with which it is provided the ventral portion of their postabdomen is furnished with numerous and strong muscles for the movements of that part of the trunk in swimming or for its retraction when alarmed and the muscles of the prehensile terminal parts of their legs especially of the anterior pair are proportionally large and strong for the contests in which they are continually en gaged fourth section muscular system of the cycloganliated or molluscous classes the limited extent and the aquatic nature of the respira tion in most of the molluscous classes and their fixed con dition or imperfect means of locomotion are accompanied with a corresponding low degree of vitality and imperfect development of their muscular system the forms also of this system as of the whole body vary much more in this than in the articulated or vertebrated divisions of the animal kingdom within the exterior cartilaginous covering of the tunicated animals is placed their muscular coat by which they are able to contract their whole body and forcibly to expel the contents of their respiratory or thoracic cavity this muscular enveloping tunic as seen in that of the cyn thia pupa fig consists chiefly of long diverging fasciculi which originate from around the two orifices of the sac a b and extend round the whole body of the animal these muscular fasciculi are attached to various points of the exterior tunic but most intimately around the respiratory and the anal b orifices which we observe also to be provided with distinct and strong sphincter muscles d e passing in a circular man ner around them by the contraction of the whole of this muscular tunic the orifices are retracted the trunk of the animal is compressed the respiration trunk is emptied and the whole body is retracted towards the fixed point to which the animal is attached the respiratory currents are produced by the vibratile cilia disposed on the branchiee and on the thoracic cavity as in other acephalous mollusca and the swimming of some of the aggregate forms as of the pyrosoma is effected by the same respiratory cur rents produced by vibratile cilia the muscular coat of the tunicata is analogous to the mantle of bivalves as their cartilaginous covering is the analogue of the shell the conchiferous animals are much more generally free than the tunicata and some of them possess considerable power of locomotion the movements are chiefly performed by the foot which is commonly a lengthened tongue shaped muscular organ capable of being protruded to some distance from the cavity of the mantle and capable of as suming a great variety of forms by this organ the con chifera attach their byssus swim at the surface of the water creep on a solid surface burrow in sand or other soft material and extricate themselves when covered the foot is composed of muscular fasciculi which decussate each other in various directions to give it great variety of movements and water is often ad mitted into its interior cavity it is sometimes wanting where the shell is permanently fixed to a spot as in the oyster it is generally more or less connected with the dorsal part of the valves and the fibres of its expanded base embrace almost the whole of the abdominal cavity the adductor muscles are the active organs by which the valves are closed against the elastic property of the ligament and they generally consist of one or two thick short and strong muscles which pass straight across the ventral surface of the abdomen to be at tached ta the inner surface of both valves the pecten is enabled to swim backwards by the powerful and repeated action of its adductor muscle on the valves the adductor muscle is large and single in most of the round forms of conchifera as the pecten ostrea anomia spondylus but in the more lengthened forms there are generally at least two this marginal muscle consists of numerous small fasciculi attached along this groove in both valves and spreading chiefly on the loose ventral margins of the mantle by forcibly retracting this part of the mantle these palleal muscles contract the respiratory sac so as to assist in a forced expiration of the contained water and they protect the most sensitive marginal part of the mantle from being compressed and injured during the closing of the valves the currents of water which are conveyed into the cavity of the mantle through the respiratory orifice and outwards through the vent for the purposes both of respiration and nourishment are entirely produced by the rapid action of vibratile cilia which are disposed in the closest arrangement around all the minutest meshes of the branchiae and cover all the fringed edges of the respiratory orifice and nearly the whole inner surface of the respiratory cavity of the mantle as all other vibra tile cilia these continue in lively activity on portions of the gill or mantle which have been long cut from the body of the animal the respiratory cavity of the mantle with highly contractile muscular parietes is often prolonged to a great distance beyond the margin of the valves es pecially in burrowing species to reach with the respiratory and anal orifices the surface of the bed or rock in which the animal is concealed besides the usual large adductor muscles there are frequently smaller supplementary trans verse muscular bands passing from the dorsal part of one valve to the other the muscular foot of the gasteropods sometimes covers the whole ventral surface of the body and sometimes ex tends only from the under surface of the neck it is the largest muscle of the body and that by which progressive motion is effected both in creeping and swimming this tractor muscle forms the only bond of con nection between the shell and the animal it contains and it is constantly advancing slowly along the pillar of the shell dur ing growth like the adductor muscles of conchifera the open mantle which secretes the calcareous matter of the shell is also distinctly muscular and contractile and the funnel for respiration is an open canal prolonged from its left side the foot is often expanded by the introduction of water into its interior cavity and its dorsal surface secretes the calca reous or horny layers which compose the operculum of the shell the neck forms generally a thick muscular sheath around the complex apparatus of the mouth and proboscis and supports on the right side the muscular exciting organ of the male anteriorly it forms the lips or the sheath of the pro boscis and the tentacula which have generally the eyes at the exterior of their base in the naked gasteropods found generally adhering to floating plants in the ocean as the scylla and tritonia the foot forms a long narrow groved organ for em bracing the tender stems to which they adhere and on which they feed most of the predaceous gasteropods possess a long and powerful muscular proboscis capable of being ex tended to a distance from the mouth and provided at its ex tremity with an exsertile bifid fleshy tongue armed with sharp conical recurved teeth as seen in that of the common whelk buccinum undatum fig both the proboscis g g and the en closed bilabiate spiny tongue a b are provided with numerous powerful ex tensor and retractor muscles contained in the neck the two divisions a of the tongue to which the teeth are at tached are often supported internally by two long cartilaginous laminae large and strong in the buccinum which appear to be the analogues of the gastric dart of conchifera the phytophagous gas teropods have generally jaws for com pressing their vegetable food or a long spiny tongue for filing it to pieces the muscular system of the pteropods like that of many of the floating gasteropods is generally soft transparent and nearly colourless so that the disposition of the fibres in the exterior closed mantle and in the finlike arms can be per ceived through the outward pellucid coverings of the body having no muscular foot for creeping their progressive mo tion depends on the movement of two muscular membranes unsupported by rays or by cartilage and extending from the sides of the body these muscular fins are developed both in the naked and the testaceous forms they present the most favourable situation for the branchiae which are generally placed on their surface and they sometimes serve as organs of prehension embracing the surface of plants and other objects floating through the sea the muscular mantle closed above forms a large abdominal cavity and its con tractions assist in expelling the natural excretions of the vis cera or in retracting the whole body within the shell the tentacula also and the whole apparatus of the head are re tracted and extended by their own muscular fibres and the oesophagus is sometimes provided with a distinct muscular bulb like many gasteropods the annexed figure fig represents two naked and two testaceous forms of pteropods with their muscular organs of motion extended laterally from the sides of the trunk and placed more anteriorly than those of the naked cephalopods in the clio australis fig a the form approaches very closely to the cephalopodic in the numerous conical tubularcephalic tentacula aaa the form of the head the position of the eyes and the lengthened cylindrical form of the trunk enveloped in a closed muscular mantle d the muscular fins c support on their pectinated surface the numerous ramifications of the branchial vessels so that the motions of these organs promote the aeration of the blood in the pneumodermon fig b the muscular pro boscis and the lateral tufts of tentacula b terminated each by a sucker are retractile the muscular arms c are ex tended from the sides of an anterior division of the trunk and the branchiae d are placed as in the doris on the pos terior part of the back but at a distance from the anus which here opens on the anterior part of the right side as in the clio the muscular arms are comparatively large in the small testaceous cleodora fig c b as they are also in the testaceous cymbulia represented in fig the fleshy mantle of the cleodora extends laterally to a distance from the sides of the head and the slender pellucid depressed tapering shell c is also expanded transversely with deeply grooved sides the fins for progressive motion are more lengthened and straight in their form in the minute testa ceous cuvieria fig j d a where there are dentiform masticating buccal organs as in a cephalopod and in which the shell c is straight lengthened conical and pointed like a belemnite the muscular organs of these and the other known forms of pteropods are constructed like their shells on the plan of those of the cephalopods especially of the lower forms of that class the organs of motion in the cephalopods as in the ptero pods are generally in form of muscular fins extending from the sides of the trunk and unsupported by osseous rays they move also by means of the muscular feet developed from the fleshy disk surrounding the head the nautilus like a gasteropod is fixed by two lateral muscles to the bot tom of its shell its muscular open mantle is thin and deli cate the muscular funnel is open beneath throughout its whole length and the mouth surrounded with strong mus cles for the calcified jaws is provided with broad muscular feet like the expanded feet of an argonaute and supporting numerous sheathed tentacula in the argonaut a
