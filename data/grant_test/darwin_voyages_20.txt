this be true there ought to exist every intermediate form between a closelyencircled and a lagoon island such forms actually occur in various parts of the ocean we have one two or more islands encircled in one reef and of these some are of small proportional size to the area enclosed by the coral formation so that a series of charts might be given showing a gradation of character between the two classes in new caledonia where the double line of reef projects miles beyond the island we may imagine we see this change in progress at the northern extremity reefs occur some of which are of the encircling kind and others almost with the character of true lagoon islands the line of reef which fronts the whole west coast of this great island has by some been called a barrier it is four hundred miles long and may be said thus to form a link between an ordinary encircling reef and the great australian barrier i should perhaps have entered before into the consideration of one apparent difficulty in the origin of lagoon islands it may be said granting the theory of subsidence a mere circular disc of coral would be formed and not a cupshaped mass in the first place even in reefs closely fringing the land as before remarked the corals do not grow on the shore itself but leave a shallow channel secondly the strong and vigorous species which alone build a solid reef are never found within the lagoon they only flourish amidst the foam of the nevertiring breakers nevertheless the more delicate corals though checked by several causes such as strong tides and deposits of sand do constantly tend to fill up the lagoon but the process must become slower and slower as the water in the shallow expanse is rendered subject to accidental impurities a curious instance of this happened at keeling island where a heavy tropical storm of rain killed nearly all the fish when the coral at last has filled up the lagoon to the height of lowest water at springtides which is the extreme limit possiblehow afterwards is the work to be completed there is no high land whence sediment can be poured down and the darkblue colour of the ocean bespeaks its purity the wind carrying calcareous dust from the outer coast is the only agent which can finally convert the lagoon island into solid land and how slow must this process be subsidence of the land must always be most difficult to detect excepting in countries long civilizedfor the movement itself tends to conceal all evidence of it nevertheless at keeling island tolerably conclusive evidence of such movement could be observed on every side of the lagoon in which the water is as tranquil as in the most sheltered lake old cocoanut trees were undermined and falling captain fitzroy likewise pointed out to me on the beach the foundationposts of a storehouse which the inhabitants said had stood seven years before just above highwater mark but now was daily washed by the tide upon asking the people whether they ever experienced earthquakes they said that lately the island had been shaken by a very bad one and that they remembered two others during the last ten years i no longer doubted concerning the cause which made the trees fall and the storehouse to be washed by the daily tide at vanikoro the encircled island already mentioned i gathered from captain dillons account that the alluvial land at the foot of the mountain was very small in quantity the channel extremely deep and the islets on the reef itself which result from the gradual accumulation of fragments singularly few in number all of which together with the walllike structure of the reef both inside as well as outside indicated to my mind that without doubt the movements of subsidence had lately been rapid at the end of the chapter it is stated that this island is shaken by earthquakes of extreme violence i may here mention a circumstance which to my mind had the same weight as positive evidence though bearing on another part of the question m quoy when discussing in general terms the nature of coral reefs gives a description which is applicable only to those which skirting the shore do not require a foundation at any greater depth than that from which the coralbuilding polypi can spring i was at first astonished at this as i knew he had crossed both the pacific and indian oceans and must as i thought have seen the class of widelyencircling reefs which indicate a subsiding land he subsequently mentions several islands as instances of his description of the general structure by a singular chance the whole can be shown by his own words in different parts of his account to have been recently elevated therefore that which appeared so adverse to the theory became as strong in its confirmation continental elevations as observed in south america and other parts seem to act over wide areas with a very uniform force we may therefore suppose that continental subsidences act in a nearly similar manner on this assumption and taking on the one hand lagoon islands encircling and barrier reefs as indications of subsidence and on the other raised shells and corals together with mere skirting reefs as our proof of elevation we may test the truth of the theorythat their configuration has been determined by the kind of subterranean movementby observing whether any uniform results can be obtained i think it can be shown that such is the case in a very remarkable degree and that certain laws may be inferred from the examination of far more importance than the mere explanation of the origin of the circular or other kinds of reef if there had been space i should have made a few general remarks before entering into any detail i may however just notice the remarkable absence of the reefbuilding polypi over certain wide areas within the tropical sea for instance on the whole west coast of america and as i believe of africa and round the eastern islands in the atlantic ocean although certain species of lamelliform zoophytes are found on the shores of the latter islands and though calcareous matter is abundant to excess yet reefs are never formed it would appear that the effective species do not occur there of which circumstance i apprehend no explanation can be given any more than why it has been ordained that certain plants as heaths should be absent from the new world although so common in the old without entering into any minute geographical details i must observe that the usual direction of the island groups in the central parts of the pacific is nw and se this must be noticed because subterranean disturbances are known to follow the coast lines of the land commencing on the shores of america there are abundant proofs that the greater part has been elevated within the recent period but as coral reefs do not occur there it is not immediately connected with our present subject immediately adjoining the continent there is an extent of ocean remarkably free from islands and where of course there exists no possible indication of any change of level we then come to a n w by w line dividing the open sea from one strewed with lagoon islands and including the two beautiful groups of encircled islands the society and georgian archipelagoes this great band having a length of more than four thousand miles by six hundred broad must according to our view be an area of subsidence we will at present for convenience sake pass over the space of ocean immediately adjoining it and proceed to the chain of islands including the new hebrides solomon and new ireland any one who examines the charts of the separate islands in the pacific engraved on a large scale will be struck with the absence of all distant or encircling reefs round these groups yet it is known that coral occurs abundantly close in shore here then according to the theory there are no proofs of subsidence and in conformity to this we find in the works of forster lesson labillardi√®re quoy and bennett constant allusion to the masses of elevated coral these islands form therefore a welldetermined band of elevation between it and the great area of subsidence first mentioned there is a broad space of sea irregularly scattered with islets of all classes some with proofs of recent elevation and merely fringed by reefs others encircled and some lagoon islands one of the latter is described by captain cook as a grand circle of breakers without a single spot of land in this case we may believe that an ordinary lagoon island has been recently submerged on the other hand there are proofs of other lagoon islands having been lifted up several yards above the level of the sea but which still retain a pool of salt water in their centres these facts show an irregular action in the subterranean forces and when we remember that the space lies directly between the wellmarked area of elevation and the enormous one of subsidence an alternate and irregular movement seems almost probable to the westward of the new hebrides line of elevation we have new caledonia and the space included between it and the australian barrier which flinders on account of the number of reefs proposed to call the corallian sea it is bounded on two sides by the grandest and most extraordinary reefs in the world and is likewise terminated to the northward by the coast of louisiademost dangerous on account of its distant reefs this then according to our theory is an area of subsidence i may here remark that as the barrier is supposed to be produced by the subsidence of the coast of the mainland it may be expected that any outlying islands would have formed lagoon islands now bligh and others distinctly state that some of the islands there are precisely similar to the wellknown lagoon islands in the pacific there are also encircled islands so that the three classes supposed to be produced by the same movement are there found in juxtaposition as likewise happens but in a less evident manner at new caledonia and in the society archipelago the new hebrides line of islands may be observed to bend abruptly at new britain thence to run nearly east and west and lastly to resume its former northwest direction in sumatra and the peninsula of malacca the figure may be compared to the letter s laid obliquely but the line is often double we have shown that the southern part as far north as new ireland abounds with proofs of elevation so is it with the rest since the time of bougainville every voyager adduces some fresh instance of such changes throughout a great part of the east indian archipelago i may specify new guinea wageeoo ceram timor java and sumatra coral reefs are abundant in the greater part of these seas but they merely skirt the shores in the same manner as we have followed the curved line of elevation so may we that of subsidence at keeling island i have already mentioned that there exist proofs of the latter movement and it is a very interesting circumstance that during the last earthquake by which that island was affected sumatra though distant nearly miles was violently shaken bearing in mind that there is evidence of recent elevation on the coast of the latter one is strongly tempted to believe that as one end of the lever goes up the other goes down that as the east indian archipelago rises the bottom of the neighbouring sea sinks and carries with it keeling island which would have been submerged long ago in the depths of the ocean had it not been for the wonderful labours of the reefbuilding polypi as i have remarked the islands in this great archipelago are only skirted with reefs and it appears from the statements of those who have visited them as well as from an examination of the charts that lagoon islands are not found there this in itself is remarkable but it becomes far more so when it is known that according to all accounts and distinctly stated by mr de la beche they are likewise absent in the west indian sea where coral is most abundant now every one is aware of the numerous proofs of recent elevation in most parts of that archipelago again ehrenberg has observed that lagoon islands do not occur in the red sea in lyells geology and in the geographical journal proofs are given of recent elevation on the shores of a large part of that sea excepting on the theory of the form of reefs being determined by the kind of movement to which they have been subjected it is a most anomalous circumstance and which has never been attempted to be solved that the lagoon structure being universal and considered as characteristic in certain parts of the ocean should be entirely absent in others of equal extent i may here also just recal to mind the cases of skirting reefs mentioned by m quoy to which number several others might be added where proofs of elevation occurred some general law must determine the marked difference between reefs merely skirting the shore and others rising from a deep ocean in the form of distant rings we have endeavoured to show that with a subsiding movement the first and simple class must necessarily pass into the second and more remarkable structure to proceed with our examination to the westward of the prolongation of the line of subsidence of which keeling island is the index we have an area of elevation for on the northern end of ceylon and on the eastern shores of india elevated shells and corals such as now exist in the neighbouring sea have been observed again in the middle of the indian ocean the laccadive maldive and chagos line of atolls or lagoons show a line of subsidence the best characterized of these namely the maldive islands extend in length for miles with an average breadth of sixty these atolls agree in most respects with the lagoons of the pacific they differ however in several of them being crowded togethersuch little groups being separated from other groups by profoundly deep channels now if we look in a chart at the prolongation of the reef towards the northern end of new caledonia and then complete the work of subsidence so as to continue producing the same results we should have the original reef broken up into many patches each of which from the vigorous growth of coral on the outside would have a constant tendency to assume a rounded form every accidental break in the continuity of the first line would determine a fresh circle in the case therefore of the low or dangerous archipelago in the pacific i believe that the lagoon islands were moulded round the flanks of so many distinct islands but in the maldives that one single mountainous island bordered by reefs and very nearly of the same actual figure and dimensions with new caledonia formerly occupied that part of the ocean lastly to the extreme westward the coast of africa is closely skirted by coral reefs and according to facts stated in captain owens voyage has probably been uplifted within a recent period the same remark applies to the northern part of madagascar and judging from the reefs likewise at the seychelles situated on the submarine prolongation of that great island between these two nne and ssw lines of elevation some lagoon and widelyencircled islands indicate a band of subsidence when we consider the absence both of widelyencircling reefs and lagoon islands in the several archipelagoes and wide areas where there are proofs of elevations and on the other hand the converse case of the absence of such proof where reefs of those classes do occur together with the juxtaposition of the different kinds produced by movements of the same order and the symmetry of the whole i think it will be difficult even independently of the explanation it offers of the peculiar configuration of each class to deny a great probability to this theory its importance if true is evident because we get at one glance an insight into the system by which the surface of the land has been broken up in a manner somewhat similar but certainly far less perfect to what a geologist would have done who had lived his ten thousand years and kept a record of the passing changes we see the law almost established that linear areas of great extent undergo movements of an astonishing uniformity and that the bands of elevation and subsidence alternate such phenomena at once impress the mind with the idea of a fluid most gradually propelled onwards from beneath one part of the solid crust to another i cannot at present do more than allude to some of the results which may be deduced from these views if we examine the points of eruption over the pacific and indian oceans we shall find that all the active volcanoes occur within the areas of elevation the asiatic band must be excepted inasmuch as we are entirely in want of information of all kinds respecting it on the other hand in the great spaces supposed to be now subsiding between the radack and dangerous archipelagoes in the corallian sea and among the atolls which front the west coast of india not one occurs if we look at the changes of level as a consequence of the propulsion of fluid matter beneath the crust as before suggested then the area to which the force is directed might be expected to yield more readily than that whence it was gradually retiring i am the more convinced that the above law is true because if we look to other parts of the world proofs of recent elevation almost invariably occur where there are active vents i may instance the west indies the cape de verds canary islands southern italy sicily and other places but in answer to this those geologists who judging from the history of the isolated volcanic mounds of europe were inclined to believe that the level of the ground was constantly oscillating up and down might maintain that on these same areas the amount of subsidence had been equal to that of elevation but that we possessed no means of knowing it i conceive it is by eliminating this source of doubt that the alternate bands of opposite movement deduced from the configuration of the reefs directly bear on this law i need not do more than simply state that we thus obtain if the view is correct a means of forming some judgment of the prevailing movements during the formation of even the oldest series where volcanic rocks occur interstratified with sedimentary deposits any thing which throws light on the movements of the ground is well worthy of consideration and the history of coral reefs may in another manner elucidate such changes in the older formations as there is every reason to believe that the lamelliform corals grow only abundantly at a small depth we may feel sure where a great thickness of coral limestone occurs that the reefs on which the zoophytes flourished must have been sinking until we are enabled to judge by some means what were the prevailing movements at different epochs it will scarcely ever be possible to speculate with any safety on the circumstances under which the complicated european formations composed of such different materials and in such different states were accumulated nor can i quite pass over the probability of the above views illustrating those admirable laws first brought forward by mr lyellof the geographical distribution of plants and animals as consequent on geological changes m lesson has remarked on the singular uniformity of the indiopolynesian flora throughout the immense area of the pacificthe dispersion of forms having been directed against the course of the tradewind if we believe that lagoon islands those monuments raised by infinite numbers of minute architects record the former existence of an archipelago or continent in the central part of polynesia whence the germs could be disseminated the problem is rendered far more intelligible again if the theory should hereafter be so far established as to allow us to pronounce that certain districts fall within areas either of elevation or subsidence it will directly bear upon that most mysterious questionwhether the series of organized beings peculiar to some isolated points are the last remnants of a former population or the first creatures of a new one springing into existence briefly to recapitulate in the first place reefs are formed around islands or on the coast of the mainland at that limited depth at which the efficient classes of zoophytes can live and where the sea is shallow irregular patches may likewise be produced afterwards from the effects of a series of small subsidences encircling reefs grand barriers or lagoon islands are mere modifications of one necessary result secondly it can be shown on the above views that the intertropical ocean throughout more than a hemisphere may be divided into linear and parallel bands of which the alternate ones have undergone within a recent period the opposite movements of elevation and subsidence thirdly that the points of eruption seem invariably to fall within areas subject to a propulsion from below the traveller who is an eyewitness of some great and overwhelming earthquake at one moment of time loses all former associations of the land being the type of solidity so will the geologist if he believe in these oscillations of level the deeplyseated origin of which is betrayed by their forms and vast dimensions perhaps be more deeply impressed with the neverceasing mutability of the crust of this our world chapter xxiii mauritius beautiful appearance hindoos cape of goo hope st helena geology history of changes in vegetation probable cause of

to collectors retrospect of the most impressive parts of the voyage mauritius to england april thin the morning we passed round the northern extremity of the isle of france from this point of view the aspect of the island equalled the expectations raised by the many wellknown descriptions of its beautiful scenery the sloping plain of the pamplemousses scattered over with houses and coloured bright green from the large fields of sugarcane composed the foreground the brilliancy of the green was the more remarkable because it is a colour which generally is only conspicuous from a very short distance towards the centre of the island groups of wooded mountains rose out of this highlycultivated plain their summits as so commonly happens with ancient volcanic rocks being jagged into the sharpest points masses of white clouds were collected around their pinnacles as if for the sake of pleasing the strangers eye the whole island with its sloping border and central mountains was adorned with an air of perfect elegance the scenery if i may use such an expression appeared to the senses harmonious i spent the greater part of the next day in walking about the town and visiting different people the town is of considerable size and is said to contain inhabitants the streets are very clean and regular although the island has been so many years under the english government the general character of the place is quite french englishmen speak to their servants in french and the shops are all french indeed i should think that calais or boulogne was much more anglefied there is a very pretty little theatre in which operas are excellently performed and are much preferred by the inhabitants to plays we were also surprised at seeing large booksellers shops with wellstored shelvesmusic and reading bespeak our approach to the old world of civilization for in truth both australia and america may be considered as new worlds one of the most interesting spectacles in port louis is to observe the various races of men which may be met in walking the streets convicts from india are banished here for life at present there are about and they are employed in various public works before seeing these people i had no idea that the inhabitants of india were such noblelooking figures their skin is extremely dark and many of the older men had large mustaches and beards of a snowwhite colour this together with the fire of their expressions gave them quite an imposing aspect the greater number have been banished for murder and the worst crimes others for causes which can scarcely be considered as moral faults such as for not obeying from superstitious motives the english laws these men are generally quiet and wellconducted from their outward conduct their cleanliness and faithful observance of their strange religious enactments it was impossible to look at them with the same eyes as on our wretched convicts in new south wales besides these prisoners large numbers of free people are yearly imported from india for the planters were afraid that the negroes when emancipated would not work from these causes the indian population is here very considerable may stsunday i took a quiet walk along the seacoast to the northward of the town the plain in that part is quite uncultivated it consists of a field of black lava smoothed over with coarse grass and bushes the latter being chiefly mimosas captain fitzroy before arriving here said he expected the island would have a character intermediate between that of the galapagos and tahiti this is a very exact comparison but it will convey a definite idea to few excepting to those who were on board the beagle it is a very pleasant country but it has not the charms of tahiti or the grandeur of a brazilian landscape the next day i ascended la pouce a mountain so called from a thumblike projection which rises close behind the town to a height of feet m lesson in the voyage of the coquille has stated that the central plain of the island appeared like the basin of a grand crater and that la pouce and the other mountains once formed parts of a connected wall from our elevated position we enjoyed an excellent view over this great mass of volcanic matter the country on this side of the island appears pretty well cultivated the whole being divided into fields and studded with farmhouses i was however assured that of the whole land not more than half is yet in a productive state if such is the case considering the present great export of sugar this island at some future period when thickly peopled will be of very great value since england has taken possession of it a period of only twentyfive years the export of sugar is said to have increased seventyfive fold one great cause of this prosperity is due to the excellent roads and means of communication throughout the island at the present day in the neighbouring isle of bourbon which remains under the french government the roads are in the same miserable state as they were only a few years past in this place the macadamizing art has perhaps been of even greater advantage to the colonies than to the mother country although the french residents must have largely profited by the increased prosperity of their island yet the english government is far from popular it is unfortunate that there appears to exist scarcely any intercourse among the higher orders of french and english may din the evening captain lloyd the surveyorgeneral so well known from his examination of the isthmus of panama invited mr stokes and myself to his countryhouse which is situated on the edge of wilheim plains and about six miles from the port we staid at this delightful place two days being elevated nearly feet above the sea the air was pleasantly cool and fresh and on every side there were delightful walks close by there is a grand ravine which is worn to a depth of about feet through the slightly inclined streams of lava which have flowed from the central platform thcaptain lloyd took us to the rivi√®re noire which is several miles to the southward in order that i might examine some rocks of elevated coral we passed through pleasant gardens and fine fields of sugarcane growing amidst huge blocks of lava the roads were bordered by hedges of mimosa and near many of the houses there were avenues of the mango some of the views where the peaked hills and the cultivated farms were seen together were exceedingly picturesque and we were constantly tempted to exclaim how pleasant it would be to pass ones life in such a quiet abode captain lloyd possessed an elephant he sent it half way with us on the road that we might enjoy a ride in true indian fashion i should think as is commonly said to be the case that the motion must be fatiguing for a long journey the circumstance which surprised me most was the quite noiseless step a ride on so wonderful an animal was extremely interesting this elephant is the only one at present on the island but it is said others will be sent for may thwe sailed from port louis on our way to the cape of good hope and on the evening of the st anchored in simons bay the little town offers but a cheerless aspect to a strangers eye about a couple of hundred square whitewashed houses with scarcely a single tree in the neighbourhood and very few gardens are scattered along the beach at the foot of a lofty steep bare wall of horizontallystratified sandstone the next day i set out for cape town which is twenty miles distant both towns are situated within the headlands but at the opposite extremities of a range of mountains which extending parallel to the mainland is joined to it by a low sandy flat the road skirted the base of these mountains for the first fourteen miles the country is very desert and with the exception of the pleasure which the sight of an entirely new vegetation never fails to communicate there was very little of interest the view however of the mountains on the opposite side of the flat brightened by the declining sun was fine within seven miles of cape town in the neighbourhood of wynberg a great improvement was visible and here the countryhouses of the more wealthy residents of the capital are situated the numerous woods of young scotch firs and stunted oaktrees form the chief attraction of this locality there is indeed a great charm in shade and retirement after the unconcealed bleakness of so open a country as this the houses and plantations are backed by a grand wall of mountains which gives the scene a degree of uncommon beauty i arrived late in the evening in cape town and had a good deal of difficulty in finding quarters in the morning several ships from india had arrived at this great inn on the great highway of nations and they had disgorged on shore a host of passengers all longing to enjoy the delights of a temperate climate there is only one good hotel so that strangers generally live in boardinghousesa very uncomfortable fashion to which i was obliged to conform although i was fortunate in my quarters in the morning i walked to a neighbouring hill to look at the town it is laid out with the rectangular precision of a spanish city the streets are in good order and macadamized and some of them have rows of trees on each side the houses are all whitewashed and look clean in several trifling particulars the town had a foreign air but it is daily becoming more english there is scarcely a resident excepting amongst the lowest order who does not speak some english in this facility in becoming anglefied there appears to exist a wide difference between this colony and that of the mauritius it does not however arise from the popularity of the english for the dutch as well as the french although they have profited to an immense degree by the english government yet thoroughly dislike our whole nation all the fragments of the civilized world which we have visited in the southern hemisphere appear to be flourishing little embryo englands are springing into life in many quarters although the cape colony possesses only a moderately fertile country it appears in a very prosperous condition in one respect it suffers like new south wales namely in the absence of water communication and in the interior being separated from the coast by a high chain of mountains this country does not possess coal and there is no timber excepting at a considerable distance hides tallow and wine are the chief exports and latterly a considerable quantity of corn the farmers are beginning also to pay attention to sheepgrazinga hint taken from australia it is no small triumph to van diemens land that live sheep have been exported from a colony of thirtythree years standing to this which was founded in in cape town it is said that the present number of inhabitants is about and in the whole colony including coloured people many different nations are here mingled together the europeans consist of dutch french and english and scattered people from other parts the malays descendants of slaves brought from the east indian archipelago form a large body they are a fine set of men and can always be distinguished by a conical hat like the roof of a circular thatched cottage or by a red handkerchief on their heads the number of negroes is not very great and the hottentots the illtreated aborigines of the country are i should think in a still smaller proportion the first object in cape town which strikes the eye of a stranger is the number of bullockwaggons several times i saw eighteen and i heard of twentyfour oxen being all yoked together in one team besides these waggons with four six and eight horses in hand go trotting about the streets i have as yet not mentioned the wellknown table mountain this great mass of horizontally stratified sandstone rises quite close behind the town to a height of feet the upper part forms an absolute wall often reaching into the region of the clouds i should think so high a mountain not forming part of an extensive platform and yet being composed of horizontal strata must be a rare phenomenon it certainly gives the landscape a very peculiar and from some points of view a grand character june thi set out on a short excursion to see the neighbouring country but i saw so very little that i have scarcely any thing to say i hired a couple of horses and a young hottentot groom to accompany me as a guide he spoke english very well and was most tidily dressed he wore a long coat beaver hat and white gloves the hottentots or hodmadods as old dampier calls them to my eye look like partially bleached negroes they are of a small stature and have most singularlyformed heads and faces the temple and cheekbones project so much that the whole face is hidden from a person standing in the same side position in which he would be enabled to see part of the features of a european their hair is very short and curly our first days ride was to the village of the paarl situated between thirty and forty miles to the ne of cape town after leaving the neighbourhood of the town where white houses stand as if picked out of a street and then by chance dropped on the open country we had to cross a wide level sandy flat totally unfit for cultivation in the hopes of finding some hard materials for making a road the sands had been bored along the whole line to the depth of forty feet but without any success leaving the flat we crossed a low undulating country thinly clothed with a slight green vegetation it was not the flowering season but even at this time of the year there were some very pretty oxalises and mesembryanthemums and on the sandy spots fine tufts of heaths there were also several beautiful little birds if a person could not find amusement in observing the animals and plants there was very little else during the whole day to interest him only here and there we passed a solitary farmhouse directly after arriving at the paarl i ascended a singular group of rounded granite hills which rise close behind the village from the summit i enjoyed a fine view of the line of mountains which i had to cross on the following morning their colours were gray or partly rusty red and their outlines irregular but far from picturesque the general tint of the lower country was a pale brownish green and the whole entirely destitute of woodland from the naked state of the mountains seen likewise through a very clear atmosphere i was reminded of northern chile but the rocks there possess at least a brilliant colouring immediately beneath the hill the long village of the paarl extended all the houses were whitewashed and appeared very comfortable and there was not a single hovel each house had its garden and a few trees planted in straight rows and there were many vineyards of considerable size which at this time of year were destitute of leaves the whole village possessed an air of quiet and respectable comfort june thafter riding about three hours we came near to the french hoeck pass this is so called from a number of emigrant protestant frenchmen who formerly settled in a flat valley at the foot of the mountain it is one of the prettiest places i saw in my excursion the pass is a considerable work an inclined road having been cut along the steep side of the mountain it forms one of the principal roads from the low land of the coast to the mountains and great plains of the interior we reached the foot of the mountains on the opposite or s e side of the pass a little after noon here at the tollbar we found comfortable lodgings for the night the surrounding mountains were destitute of trees and even of brushwood but they supported a scattered vegetation of rather a brighter green than usual the quantity however of white siliceous sandstone every where protruding itself uncovered gave to the country a bleak and desolate aspect thmy intention was to return by sir lowry coles pass over the same chain of mountains as before but a little further to the south following unfrequented paths we crossed an irregular hilly country until we joined the other line of road during the whole long day i met scarcely a single person and saw but few inhabited spots or any number of cattle a few roebucks were grazing on the sides of the hills and some large dirty white vultures like the condors of america slowly wheeled over the place where probably some dead animal was lying there was not even a tree to break the monotonous uniformity of the sandstone hills i never saw a much less interesting country at night we slept at the house of an english farmer and at an early hour the next day we descended by sir lowrys pass which like that of the french hoeck has been cut at a great expense along the flank of a steep mountain from the summit there was a noble view of the whole of false bay and of the table mountain and immediately below of the cultivated country of hottentot holland the flat covered with sanddunes did not appear when viewed from this height of the tedious length which we found it before we reached in the evening cape town june thwe put to sea and on the th crossed the tropic of capricorn for the sixth and last time on the th of july we arrived off st helena this island the forbidding aspect of which has been so often described rises like a huge castle from the ocean a great wall built of successive streams of black lava forms around the whole circuit a bold coast near the town as if in aid of the natural defence small forts and guns are every where built up and mingled with the rugged rocks the town extends up a flat and very narrow valley the houses look respectable and they are interspersed with a very few green trees when approaching the anchorage there is one striking view an irregular castle perched on the summit of a lofty hill and surrounded by a few scattered firtrees boldly projects against the sky the next day i obtained lodgings within a stones throw of napoleons tomb i confess however this had little attraction for me but it was a capital central situation whence i could make excursions in every direction during the four days i staid here from morning to night i wandered over the island and examined its geological history the house was situated at an elevation of about feet here the weather was cold and very boisterous with constant showers of rain and every now and then the whole scene was veiled in thick clouds near the coast the rough lava is entirely destitute of vegetation in the central and higher parts a different series of rocks have from extreme decomposition produced a clayey soil which where not covered by vegetation is stained in broad bands of many bright colours at this season the land moistened by constant showers produces a singularly bright green pasture this lower and lower down gradually fades away and at last disappears in latitude and at the trifling elevation of feet it is surprising to behold a vegetation possessing a character decidedly english the hills are crowned with irregular plantations of scotch firs and the sloping banks are thickly scattered over with thickets of gorze covered with its bright yellow flowers weepingwillows are common along the course of the rivulets and the hedges are made of the blackberry producing its wellknown fruit when we consider that the number of plants now found on the island is and that out of these fiftytwo alone are native species the rest being imported and many of them from england we see a good reason for this english character in the vegetation the numerous species which have been so recently introduced can hardly have failed to have destroyed some of the native kinds i believe there is no accurate account of the state of the vegetation at the period when the island was covered with trees such would have formed a most curious comparison with its present sterile condition and limited flora many english plants appear to flourish here better than in their native country some also from the opposite quarter of australia succeed remarkably well it is only on the highest and steepest ridges where the native flora is still predominant the english or rather the welsh character of the scenery is preserved by the numerous cottages and small white houses some buried at the bottom of the deepest valleys and others stuck up on the crests of the lofty hills some of the views are very striking i may instance that from near sir w dovetons house where the bold peak called lott is seen over a dark wood of firs the whole being backed by the red waterworn mountains of the southern shore on viewing the island from an eminence the first circumstance which strikes one is the very great number of roads and forts the labour bestowed on the public works if one forgets its character as a prison seem out of all proportion to its extent or value there is so little level or useful land that it seems surprising how so many people about can subsist here the lower orders or the emancipated slaves are i believe extremely poor they complain of want of work a fact which is likewise shown by the very cheap labour from the reduction in the number of public servants owing to the island having been given up by the east india company and the consequent emigration of many of the richer people the poverty probably will increase the chief food of the working class is rice with a little salt meat as neither of these articles are the products of the island but must be purchased with money the low wages tell heavily on the poor people the fine times as my old guide called them when bony was here can never return again now that the people are blessed with freedom a right which i believe they value fully it seems probable that their numbers will quickly increase if so what is to become of the little state of st helena my guide was an elderly man who had been a goatherd when a boy and knew every step amongst the rocks he was of a race many times mixed and although with a dusky skin he had not the disagreeable expression of a mulatto he was a very civil quiet old man and such appears the character of the greater number among the lower classes it was strange to my ears to hear a man nearly white and respectably dressed talking with indifference of the times when he was a slave with my companion who carried our dinner and a horn of water which latter is quite necessary as all in the lower valleys is saline i every day took long walks beneath the limits of the elevated and central green circle the wild valleys are quite desolate and untenanted here to the geologist there are scenes of high interest which show the successive changes and complicated disturbances which have in past times happened according to my views st helena has existed as an island from a very remote epoch some obscure proofs however of the elevation of the land are still extant i believe that the central and highest peaks form parts of the rim of a great crater the southern half of which has been removed by the waves of the sea there is moreover an external margin of black volcanic rocks which belong to an anterior condition of things these have been dislocated and broken up by forces acting from below so that the confusion in structure from these different causes is extreme on the higher parts of the island considerable numbers of shells occur embedded in the soil which have always been supposed to be of marine origin and the fact has been adduced as a proof of the retreat of the sea the shell turns out to be a bulimus or terrestrial species it is however very remarkable that it is not now found in a living state a circumstance which in all probability may be attributed to the entire destruction of the woods and consequent loss of food and shelter which occurred during the early part of the last century the history of the changes which the elevated plains of longwood and deadwood have undergone as given in general beatsons account of the island is extremely curious it is said the plain in former times was covered with wood and was therefore called the great wood so late as the year there were many trees upon it but in the old trees had mostly fallen and as goats and hogs were at that time suffered to range about all the young trees had been devoured it appears also from the official records that the trees were unexpectedly some years afterwards succeeded by indigenous wire grass which now spreads over its whole extent he then adds these are curious facts since they trace the changes which this remarkable spot of land has undergone for now this formerly naked plain after the trees had fallen is covered with fine sward and is become the finest piece of pasture on the island the extent of surface which was probably covered by wood at a former period is estimated at no less than two thousand acres at the present day scarcely a tree can be found there it is said that in there were quantities of dead wood in sandy bay this place is now so utterly desert that nothing but so wellattested an account could make me believe that trees had ever existed there the fact that the goats and hogs destroyed all the young trees as they sprung up and that in the course of time the old ones which were safe from their attacks perished from age seems clearly made out goats were introduced in the year eightysix years afterwards in the time of cavendish it is known they were exceedingly numerous more than a century afterwards in when the evil was completed and found irretrievable an order was issued that all stray animals should be destroyed when at valparaiso i heard it positively affirmed that the sandalwood tree had been found on the island of juan fernandez in considerable numbers but that all without exception were standing dead at the time i thought it was some mysterious case of the natural death of a species but when it is remembered that goats for very many years have abounded on that island it seems most probable that the young trees were prevented growing and that the old ones perished from age it is a very interesting fact to observe that the arrival of animals at st helena in did not change the whole aspect of the island until a period of two hundred and twenty years had elapsed for they were introduced in and in it is said the old trees had mostly fallen there can be no doubt this change affected not only the bulimus and probably some other land shells of which i obtained specimens from the same bed but likewise a multitude of insects st helena situated so remote from any continent in the midst of a great ocean and possessing a unique florathis little world within itselfexcites our curiosity birds and insects as might have been expected are very few in number indeed i believe all the birds have been introduced within late years partridges and pheasants are tolerably abundant the island is much too english not to be subject to strict gamelaws i was told of a more unjust sacrifice to such ordinances than i ever heard of even in england the poor people formerly used to burn a plant which grows on the coast rocks and export soda but a peremptory order came out prohibiting this practice and giving as a reason that the partridges would have nowhere to build in my walks i passed more than once over the grassy plain bounded by deep valleys on which longwood stands viewed from a short distance it appears like a respectable gentlemans countryseat in front there are a few cultivated fields and beyond them the hill of coloured rocks called the flagstaff and the square black mass of the barn on the whole the view is rather bleak and uninteresting the scrupulous degree to which the coast must formerly have been guarded is quite extraordinary there are alarm houses alarm guns and alarm stations on every peak i was much struck with the number of forts and picket houses on the line leading down to prosperous bay one would have supposed that this at least was an easy descent i found it however a mere goatpath and in one spot the use of ropes which were fixed into rings in the cliff were almost indispensable at the present day two artillerymen are kept there for what use it is not easy to conjecture prosperous bay although with so flourishing a name has nothing more attractive than a wild seabeach and black utterly barren rocks the only inconvenience i suffered in my walks was from the impetuous winds one day i noticed a curious circumstance standing on the edge of a plain terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand feet in depth i saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward some tern struggling against a very strong breeze whilst where i stood the air was quite calm approaching close to the brink i stretched out my arm which immediately felt the full force of the wind an invisible barrier of two yards wide separated a strongly agitated from a perfectly calm air the current meeting the bold face of the cliff must have been reflected upwards at a certain angle within which plane there necessarily would be either an eddy or a calm i so much enjoyed my rambles among the rocks and mountains of st helena that i felt almost sorry on the morning of the th to descend to the town before noon i was on board and the beagle made sail for ascension we reached the anchorage of the latter place on the evening of the th july those who have beheld a volcanic island situated within an arid climate will be able at once to picture to themselves the aspect of ascension they will imagine smooth conical hills of a bright red colour with their summits generally truncated rising distinct out of a level surface of black rugged lava a principal mound in the centre of the island seems the father of the lesser cones it is called green hill its name is taken from the faintest tinge of that colour which at this time of the year was barely perceptible from the anchorage to complete this desolate scene the black rocks on the coast are lashed by a wild and turbulent sea the settlement is near the beach it consists of several houses and barracks placed irregularly but well built of white freestone the only inhabitants are marines and some negroes liberated from slaveships who are paid and victualled by government there is not a private person on the island many of the marines appeared well contented with their situation they think it better to serve their oneandtwenty years on shore let it be what it may than in a ship in which choice if i were a marine i would most heartily agree the next morning i ascended green hill feet high and thence walked across the island to the windward point a good cartroad leads from the coast settlement to the houses gardens and fields placed near the summit of the central mountain on the roadside there are milestones and likewise cisterns where each thirsty passerby can drink some good water similar care is displayed in each part of the establishment and especially in the management of the springs so that a single drop of water shall not be lost indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in firstrate order i could not help when admiring the active industry which had created such effects out of such means at the same time regretting that it was wasted on so poor and trifling an end m lesson has remarked with justice that the english nation alone would have thought of making the island of ascension a productive spot any other people would have held it without any further views as a mere fortress in the ocean near the coast nothing grows a little inland an occasional green castoroil plant and a few grasshoppers true friends of the desert may be met with some grass is scattered over the surface of the central elevated region and the whole much resembles the worse parts of the welsh mountains but scanty as the pasture appears about six hundred sheep many goats a few cows and horses all thrive well on it of native animals rats and landcrabs swarm in numbers of native birds there are none but the guineafowl imported from the cape de verd islands is abundant and the common fowl has likewise run wild some cats which were originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice have increased so as to become a great plague the island is entirely destitute of trees in which and in every other respect it is very far inferior to st helena mr dring tells me that the witty people of the latter place say we know we live on a rock but the poor people of ascension live on a cinder the distinction in truth is very just on the succeeding days i took long walks and examined some rather curious points in the mineralogical composition of some of the volcanic rocks to which i was guided by the kindness of lieut evans on the basaltic masses which are daily washed by the tide most curious calcareous incrustations have been deposited they resemble in form certain cryptogamic plants especially the marchanti√¶ their surface is perfectly smooth and glossy and their colour black which seems owing to animal matter i have shown these incrustations to several geologists and not one guessed their true origin any one would suppose that they had been the product of fire rather than of a deposition of calcareous matter now constantly undergoing a round of decay and renovation from the action of the breakers near the settlement where these incrustations occur there is a large beach of calcareous sand entirely composed of comminuted and rounded fragments of shells and corals the lower part of this from the percolation of water containing calcareous matter in solution soon becomes consolidated and is used as a building stone but some of the layers are too hard for freestone and when struck by the hammer ring like flint the main line of beach is directed ne and sw lieutenant evans informs me that during the six months included between the st of april and the st of october the sand accumulates towards the ne extremity and during the other six it travels back again towards the sw end this periodical movement is due to a change in the direction of the swell which is influenced by the general direction of the tradewind during the two periods of the year lieutenant evans also informs me that during the six years he has resided on this island he has always observed that in the months of october and november when the sand commences travelling towards the sw the rocks which are situated at that end of the long beach become coated by a white thick and very hard calcareous layer i saw portions of this remarkable deposit which had been protected by an accumulation of sand in the year it was much thicker than during any other period it would appear that the water charged with calcareous matter by the disturbance of a vast mass of calcareous particles only partially cemented together deposits this substance on the first rocks against which it impinges but the most singular circumstance is that in the course of a couple of months this layer is either abraded or redissolved so that after that period it entirely disappears it is curious thus to trace the origin of a periodical incrustation on certain isolated rocks to the motion of the earth with relation to
