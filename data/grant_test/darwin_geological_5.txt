therefore belonging to a subsequent age these strata of sandstone often pass into shale and alternate with layers of impure coal they have in many places been violently disturbed near hobart town i observed one dike nearly a hundred yards in width on one side of which the strata were tilted at an angle of and on the other they were in some parts vertical and had been altered by the effects of the heat on the west side of storm bay i found these strata capped by streams of basaltic lava with olivine and close by there was a mass of brecciated scoriæ containing pebbles of lava which probably marks the place of an ancient submarine crater two of these streams of basalt were separated from each other by a layer of argillaceous wacke which could be traced passing into partially altered scoriæ the wacke contained numerous rounded grains of a soft grassgreen mineral with a waxy lustre and translucent on its edges under the blowpipe it instantly blackened and the points fused into a strongly magnetic black enamel in these characters it resembles those masses of decomposed olivine described at st jago in the cape de verde group and i should have thought that it had thus originated had i not found a similar substance in cylindrical threads within the cells of the vesicular basalta state under which olivine never appears this substance i believe would be classed as bole by mineralogists travertin with extinct plantsbehind hobart town there is a small quarry of a hard travertin the lower strata of which abound with distinct impressions of leaves mr robert brown had the kindness to look at my specimens and he informed me that there are four or five kinds none of which he recognises as belonging to existing species the most remarkable leaf is palmate like that of a fanpalm and no plant having leaves of this structure has hitherto been discovered in van diemens land the other leaves do not resemble the most usual form of the eucalyptus of which tribe the existing forests are chiefly composed nor do they resemble that class of exceptions to the common form of the leaves of the eucalyptus which occur in this island the travertin containing this remnant of a lost vegetation is of a pale yellow colour hard and in parts even crystalline but not compact and is everywhere penetrated by minute tortuous cylindrical pores it contains a very few pebbles of quartz and occasionally layers of chalcedonic nodules like those of chert in our greensand from the pureness of this calcareous rock it has been searched for in other places but has never been found from this circumstance and from the character of the deposit it was probably formed by a calcareous spring entering a small pool or narrow creek the strata have subsequently been tilted and fissured and the surface has been covered by a singular mass with which also a large fissure has been filled up formed of balls of trap embedded in a mixture of wacke and a white earthy aluminocalcareous substance hence it would appear as if a volcanic eruption had taken place on the borders of the pool in which the calcareous matter was depositing and had broken it up and drained it elevation of the landboth the eastern and western shores of the bay in the neighbourhood of hobart town are in most parts covered to the height of thirty feet above the level of highwater mark with broken shells mingled with pebbles the colonists attribute these shells to the aborigines having carried them up for food undoubtedly there are many large mounds as was pointed out to me by mr frankland which have been thus formed but i think from the numbers of the shells from their frequent small size from the manner in which they are thinly scattered and from some appearances in the form of the land that we must attribute the presence of the greater number to a small elevation of the land on the shore of ralph bay opening into storm bay i observed a continuous beach about fifteen feet above highwater mark clothed with vegetation and by digging into it pebbles encrusted with serpulæ were found along the banks also of the river derwent i found a bed of broken sea shells above the surface of the river and at a point where the water is now much too fresh for seashells to live but in both these cases it is just possible that before certain spits of sand and banks of mud in storm bay were accumulated the tides might have risen to the height where we now find the shells evidence more or less distinct of a change of level between the land and water has been detected on almost all the land on this side of the globe capt grey and other travellers have found in southern australia upraised shells belonging either to the recent or to a late tertiary period the french naturalists in baudins expedition found shells similarly circumstanced on the sw coast of australia the rev w b clarke finds proofs of the elevation of the land to the amount of feet at the cape of good hope in the neighbourhood of the bay of islands in new zealand i observed that the shores were scattered to some height as at van diemens land with seashells which the colonists attribute to the natives whatever may have been the origin of these shells i cannot doubt after having seen a section of the valley of the thames river s drawn by the rev w williams that the land has been there elevated on the opposite sides of this great valley three steplike terraces composed of an enormous accumulation of rounded pebbles exactly correspond with each other the escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in height no one after having examined the terraces in the valleys on the western shores of south america which are strewed with seashells and have been formed during intervals of rest in the slow elevation of the land could doubt that the new zealand terraces have been similarly formed i may add that dr dieffenbach in his description of the chatham islands s w of new zealand states that it is manifest that the sea has left many places bare which were once covered by its waters king georges sound this settlement is situated at the southwestern angle of the australian continent the whole country is granitic with the constituent minerals sometimes obscurely arranged in straight or curved laminæ in these cases the rock would be called by humboldt gneissgranite and it is remarkable that the form of the bare conical hills appearing to be composed of great folding layers strikingly resembles on a small scale those composed of gneissgranite at rio de janeiro and those described by humboldt at venezuela these plutonic rocks are in many places intersected by trappeandikes in one place i found ten parallel dikes ranging in an e and w line and not far off another set of eight dikes composed of a different variety of trap ranging at right angles to the former ones i have observed in several primary districts the occurrence of systems of dikes parallel and close to each other superficial ferruginous bedsthe lower parts of the country are everywhere covered by a bed following the inequalities of the surface of a honeycombed sandstone abounding with oxides of iron beds of nearly similar composition are common i believe along the whole western coast of australia and on many of the east indian islands at the cape of good hope at the base of the mountains formed of granite and capped with sandstone the ground is everywhere coated either by a finegrained rubbly ochraceous mass like that at king georges sound or by a coarser sandstone with fragments of quartz and rendered hard and heavy by an abundance of the hydrate of iron which presents when freshly broken a metallic lustre both these varieties have a very irregular texture including spaces either rounded or angular full of loose sand from this cause the surface is always honeycombed the oxide of iron is most abundant on the edges of the cavities where alone it affords a metallic fracture in these formations as well as in many true sedimentary deposits it is evident that iron tends to become aggregated either in the form of a shell or of a network the origin of these superficial beds though sufficiently obscure seems to be due to alluvial action on detritus abounding with iron superficial calcareous deposita calcareous deposit on the summit of bald head containing branched bodies supposed by some authors to have been corals has been celebrated by the descriptions of many distinguished voyagers it folds round and conceals irregular hummocks of granite at the height of feet above the level of the sea it varies much in thickness where stratified the beds are often inclined at high angles even as much as at degrees and they dip in all directions these beds are sometimes crossed by oblique and evensided laminæ the deposit consists either of a fine white calcareous powder in which not a trace of structure can be discovered or of exceedingly minute rounded grains of brown yellowish and purplish colours both varieties being generally but not always mixed with small particles of quartz and being cemented into a more or less perfect stone the rounded calcareous grains when heated in a slight degree instantly lose their colours in this and in every other respect closely resembling those minute equalsized particles of shells and corals which at st helena have been drifted up the sides of the mountains and have thus been winnowed of all coarser fragments i cannot doubt that the coloured calcareous particles here have had a similar origin the impalpable powder has probably been derived from the decay of the rounded particles this certainly is possible for on the coast of peru i have traced large unbroken shells gradually falling into a substance as fine as powdered chalk both of the abovementioned varieties of calcareous sandstone frequently alternate with and blend into thin layers of a hard substalagmitic rock which even when the stone on each side contains particles of quartz is entirely free from them hence we must suppose that these layers as well as certain veinlike masses have been formed by rain dissolving the calcareous matter and reprecipitating it as has happened at st helena each layer probably marks a fresh surface when the now firmly cemented particles existed as loose sand these layers are sometimes brecciated and recemented as if they had been broken by the slipping of the sand when soft i did not find a single fragment of a seashell but bleached shells of the helix melo an existing land species abound in all the strata and i likewise found another helix and the case of an oniscus the branches are absolutely undistinguishable in shape from the broken and upright stumps of a thicket their roots are often uncovered and are seen to diverge on all sides here and there a branch lies prostrate the branches generally consist of the sandstone rather firmer than the surrounding matter with the central parts filled either with friable calcareous matter or with a substalagmitic variety this central part is also frequently penetrated by linear crevices sometimes though rarely containing a trace of woody matter these calcareous branching bodies appear to have been formed by fine calcareous matter being washed into the casts or cavities left by the decay of branches and roots of thickets buried under drifted sand the whole surface of the hill is now undergoing disintegration and hence the casts which are compact and hard are left projecting in calcareous sand at the cape of good hope i found the casts described by abel quite similar to these at bald head but their centres are often filled with black carbonaceous matter not yet removed it is not surprising that the woody matter should have been almost entirely removed from the casts on bald head for it is certain that many centuries must have elapsed since the thickets were buried at present owing to the form and height of the narrow promontory no sand is drifted up and the whole surface as i have remarked is wearing away we must therefore look back to a period when the land stood lower of which the french naturalists found evidence in upraised shells of recent species for the drifting on bald head of the calcareous and quartzose sand and the consequent embedment of the vegetable remains there was only one appearance which at first made me doubt concerning the origin of the castnamely that the finer roots from different stems sometimes became united together into upright plates or veins but when the manner is borne in mind in which fine roots often fill up cracks in hard earth and that these roots would decay and leave hollows as well as the stems there is no real difficulty in this case besides the calcareous branches from the cape of good hope i have seen casts of exactly the same forms from madeira and from bermuda at this latter place the surrounding calcareous rocks judging from the specimens collected by lieut nelson are likewise similar as is their subaërial formation reflecting on the stratification of the deposit on bald headon the irregularly alternating layers of substalagmitic rockon the uniformly sized and rounded particles apparently of seashells and coralson the abundance of landshells throughout the massand finally on the absolute resemblance of the calcareous casts to the stumps roots and branches of that kind of vegetation which would grow on sandhillocks i think there can be no reasonable doubt notwithstanding the different opinion of some authors that a true view of their origin has been here given calcareous deposits like these of king georges sound are of vast extent on the australian shores dr fitton remarks that recent calcareous breccia by which term all these deposits are included was found during baudins voyage over a space of no less than degrees of latitude and an equal extent of longitude on the southern western and northwestern coasts it appears also from m péron with whose observations and opinions on the origin of the calcareous matter and branching casts mine entirely accord that the deposit is generally much more continuous than near king georges sound at swan river archdeacon scott states that in one part it extends ten miles inland captain wickham moreover informs me that during his late survey of the western coast the bottom of the sea wherever the vessel anchored was ascertained by crowbars being let down to consist of white calcareous matter hence it seems that along this coast as at bermuda and at keeling atoll submarine and subaërial deposits are contemporaneously in process of formation from the disintegration of marine organic bodies the extent of these deposits considering their origin is very striking and they can be compared in this respect only with the great coralreefs of the indian and pacific oceans in other parts of the world for instance in south america there are superficial calcareous deposits of great extent in which not a trace of organic structure is discoverable these observations would lead to the enquiry whether such deposits may not also have been formed from disintegrated shells and corals cape of good hope after the accounts given by barrow carmichael basil hall and w b clarke of the geology of this district i shall confine myself to a few observations on the junction of the three principal formations the fundamental rock is granite overlaid by clayslate the latter is generally hard and glossy from containing minute scales of mica it alternates with and passes into beds of slightly crystalline feldspathic slaty rock this clayslate is remarkable from being in some places as on the lions rump decomposed even to the depth of twenty feet into a palecoloured sandstonelike rock which has been mistaken i believe by some observers for a separate formation i was guided by dr andrew smith to a fine junction at green point between the granite and clayslate the latter at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the spot where the granite appears on the beach though probably the granite is much nearer underground becomes slightly more compact and crystalline at a less distance some of the beds of clayslate are of a homogeneous texture and obscurely striped with different zones of colour whilst others are obscurely spotted within a hundred yards of the first vein of granite the clayslate consists of several varieties some compact with a tinge of purple others glistening with numerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly crystallised feldspar some obscurely granular others porphyritic with small elongated spots of a soft white mineral which being easily corroded gives to this variety a vesicular appearance close to the granite the clayslate is changed into a darkcoloured laminated rock having a granular fracture which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar coated by minute brilliant scales of mica the actual junction between the granitic and clayslate districts extends over a width of about yards and consists of irregular masses and of numerous dikes of granite entangled and surrounded by the clayslate most of the dikes range in a nw and se line parallel to the cleavage of the slate as we leave the junction thin beds and lastly mere films of the altered clayslate are seen quite isolated as if floating in the coarselycrystallised granite but although completely detached they all retain traces of the uniform nw and se cleavage this fact has been observed in other similar cases and has been advanced by some eminent geologists as a great difficulty on the ordinary theory of granite having been injected whilst liquefied but if we reflect on the probable state of the lower surface of a laminated mass like clayslate after having been violently arched by a body of molten granite we may conclude that it would be full of fissures parallel to the planes of cleavage and that these would be filled with granite so that wherever the fissures were close to each other mere parting layers or wedges of the slate would depend into the granite should therefore the whole body of rock afterwards become worn down and denuded the lower ends of these dependent masses or wedges of slate would be left quite isolated in the granite yet they would retain their proper lines of cleavage from having been united whilst the granite was fluid with a continuous covering of clayslate following in company with dr a smith the line of junction between the granite and the slate as it stretched inland in a se direction we came to a place where the slate was converted into a finegrained perfectly characterised gneiss composed of yellowishbrown granular feldspar of abundant black brilliant mica and of few and thin laminæ of quartz from the abundance of the mica in this gneiss compared with the small quantity and excessively minute scales in which it exists in the glossy clayslate we must conclude that it has been here formed by the metamorphic actiona circumstance doubted under nearly similar circumstances by some authors the laminæ of the clayslate are straight and it was interesting to observe that as they assumed the character of gneiss they became undulatory with some of the smaller flexures angular like the laminæ of many true metamorphic schists sandstone formationthis formation makes the most imposing feature in the geology of southern africa the strata are in many parts horizontal and attain a thickness of about feet the sandstone varies in character it contains little earthy matter but is often stained with iron some of the beds are very finegrained and quite white others are as compact and homogeneous as quartz rock in some places i observed a breccia of quartz with the fragments almost dissolved in a siliceous paste broad veins of quartz often including large and perfect crystals are very numerous and it is evident in nearly all the strata that silica has been deposited from solution in remarkable quantity many of the varieties of quartzite appeared quite like metamorphic rocks but from the upper strata being as siliceous as the lower and from the undisturbed junctions with the granite which in many places can be examined i can hardly believe that these sandstonestrata have been exposed to heat on the lines of junction between these two great formations i found in several places the granite decayed to the depth of a few inches and succeeded either by a thin layer of ferruginous shale or by four or five inches in thickness of the recemented crystals of the granite on which the great pile of sandstone immediately rested mr schomburgk has described a great sandstone formation in northern brazil resting on granite and resembling to a remarkable degree in composition and in the external form of the land this formation of the cape of good hope the sandstones of the great platforms of eastern australia which also rest on granite differ in containing more earthy and less siliceous matter no fossil remains have been discovered in these three vast deposits finally i may add that i did not see any boulders of fartransported rocks at the cape of good hope or on the eastern and western shores of australia or at van diemens land in the northern island of new zealand i noticed some large blocks of greenstone but whether their parent rock was far distant i had no opportunity of determining part ii south america

of the geology of south america and almost exclusively of the parts southward of the tropic of capricorn i have arranged the chapters according to the age of the deposits occasionally departing from this order for the sake of geographical simplicity the elevation of the land within the recent period and the modifications of its surface through the action of the sea to which subjects i paid particular attention will be first discussed i will then pass on to the tertiary deposits and afterwards to the older rocks only those districts and sections will be described in detail which appear to me to deserve some particular attention and i will at the end of each chapter give a summary of the results we will commence with the proofs of the upheaval of the eastern coast of the continent from the rio plata southward and in the next chapter follow up the same subject along the shores of chile and peru on the northern bank of the great estuary of the rio plata near maldonado i found at the head of a lake sometimes brackish but generally containing fresh water a bed of muddy clay six feet in thickness with numerous shells of species still existing in the plata namely the azara labiata dorbig fragments of mytilus eduliformis dorbig paludestrina isabellei dorbig and the solen caribæus lam which last was embedded vertically in the position in which it had lived these shells lie at the height of only two feet above the lake nor would they have been worth mentioning except in connection with analogous facts at monte video i noticed near the town and along the base of the mount beds of a living mytilus raised some feet above the surface of the plata in a similar bed at a height from thirteen to sixteen feet m isabelle collected eight species which according to m dorbigny now live at the mouth of the estuary at colonia del sacramiento further westward i observed at the height of about fifteen feet above the river there of quite fresh water a small bed of the same mytilus which lives in brackish water at monte video near the mouth of uruguay and for at least thirtyfive miles northward there are at intervals large sandy tracts extending several miles from the banks of the river but not raised much above its level abounding with small bivalves which occur in such numbers that at the agraciado they are sifted and burnt for lime those which i examined near the a s juan were much worn they consisted of mactra isabellei dorbig mingled with few of venus sinuosa lam both inhabiting as i am informed by m dorbigny brackish water at the mouth of the plata nearly or quite as salt as the open sea the loose sand in which these shells are packed is heaped into low straight long lines of dunes like those left by the sea at the head of many bays m dorbigny has described an analogous phenomenon on a greater scale near san pedro on the river parana where he found widely extended beds and hillocks of sand with vast numbers of the azara labiata at the height of nearly feet english above the surface of that river the azara inhabits brackish water and is not known to be found nearer to san pedro than buenos ayres distant above miles in a straight line nearer buenos ayres on the road from that place to san isidro there are extensive beds as i am informed by sir woodbine parish of the azara labiata lying at about forty feet above the level of the river and distant between two and three miles from it these shells are always found on the highest banks in the district they are embedded in a stratified earthy mass precisely like that of the great pampean deposit hereafter to be described in one collection of these shells there were some valves of the venus sinuosa lam the same species found with the mactra on the banks of the uruguay south of buenos ayres near ensenada there are other beds of the azara some of which seem to have been embedded in yellowish calcareous semicrystalline matter and sir w parish has given me from the banks of the arroyo del tristan situated in this same neighbourhood at the distance of above a league from the plata a specimen of a palereddish calcareoargillaceous stone precisely like parts of the pampean deposit the importance of which fact will be referred to in a succeeding chapter abounding with shells of an azara much worn but which in general form and appearance closely resemble and are probably identical with the a labiata besides these shells cellular highly crystalline rock formed of the casts of small bivalves is found near ensenada and likewise beds of seashells which from their appearance appear to have lain on the surface sir w parish has given me some of these shells and m dorbigny pronounces them to be southward of buenos ayres which m dorbigny attributes with much probability to the action of the sea before the plains were raised above its level southward of the platathe coast as far as bahia blanca in lat s is formed either of a horizontal range of cliffs or of immense accumulations of sanddunes within bahia blanca a small piece of tableland about twenty feet above highwater mark called punta alta is formed of strata of cemented gravel and of red earthy mud abounding with shells with others lying loose on the surface and the bones of extinct mammifers these shells twenty in number together with a balanus and two corals are all recent species still inhabiting the neighbouring seas they will be enumerated in the eleventh chapter when describing the pampean formation five of them are identical with the upraised ones from near buenos ayres the northern shore of bahia blanca is in main part formed of immense sanddunes resting on gravel with recent shells and ranging in lines parallel to the shore these ranges are separated from each other by flat spaces composed of stiff impure red clay in which at the distance of about two miles from the coast i found by digging a few minute fragments of seashells the sanddunes extend several miles inland and stand on a plain which slopes up to a height of between one and two hundred feet numerous small well rounded pebbles of pumice lie scattered both on the plain and sandhillocks at monte hermoso on the flat summit of a cliff i found many of them at a height of feet angular measurement above the level of the sea these pumice pebbles no doubt were originally brought down from the cordillera by the rivers which cross the continent in the same way as the river negro anciently brought down and still brings down pumice and as the river chupat brings down scoriæ when once delivered at the mouth of a river they would naturally have travelled along the coasts and been cast up during the elevation of the land at different heights the origin of the argillaceous flats which separate the parallel ranges of sanddunes seems due to the tides here having a tendency as i believe they have on most shoal protected coasts to throw up a bar parallel to the shore and at some distance from it this bar gradually becomes larger affording a base for the accumulation of sanddunes and the shallow space within then becomes silted up with mud the repetition of this process without any elevation of the land would form a level plain traversed by parallel lines of sandhillocks during a slow elevation of the land the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined surface like that on the northern shore of bahia blanca i did not observe any shells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than twenty feet and therefore the age of the seadrifted pebbles of pumice now standing at the height of feet must remain uncertain the main plain surrounding bahia blanca i estimated at from to feet it insensibly rises towards the distant sierra ventana there are in this neighbourhood some other and lower plains but they do not abut one at the foot of the other in the manner hereafter to be described so characteristic of patagonia the plain on which the settlement stands is crossed by many low sanddunes abounding with the minute shells of the paludestrina australis dorbig which now lives in the bay this low plain is bounded to the south at the cabeza del buey by the cliffformed margin of a wide plain of the pampean formation which i estimated at sixty feet in height on the summit of this cliff there is a range of high sanddunes extending several miles in an east and west line southward of bahia blanca the river colorado flows between two plains apparently from thirty to forty feet in height of these plains the southern one slopes up to the foot of the great sandstone plateau of the rio negro and the northern one against an escarpment of the pampean deposit so that the colorado flows in a valley fifty miles in width between the upper escarpments i state this because on the low plain at the foot of the northern escarpment i crossed an immense accumulation of high sanddunes estimated by the gauchos at no less than eight miles in breadth these dunes range westward from the coast which is twenty miles distant to far inland in lines parallel to the valley they are separated from each other by argillaceous flats precisely like those on the northern shore of bahia blanca at present there is no source whence this immense accumulation of sand could proceed but if as i believe the upper escarpments once formed the shores of an estuary in that case the sandstone formation of the river negro would have afforded an inexhaustible supply of sand which would naturally have accumulated on the northern shore as on every part of the coast open to the south winds between bahia blanca and buenos ayres at san blas s a little south of the mouth of the colorado m dorbigny found fourteen species of existing shells six of them identical with those from bahia blanca embedded in their natural positions from the zone of depth which these shells are known to inhabit they must have been uplifted thirtytwo feet he also found at from fifteen to twenty feet above this bed the remains of an ancient beach ten miles southward but miles to the west at port s antonio the officers employed on the survey assured me that they saw many old seashells strewed on the surface of the ground similar to those found on other parts of the coast of patagonia at san josef ninety miles south in nearly the same longitude i found above the gravel which caps an old tertiary formation an irregular bed and hillocks of sand several feet in thickness abounding with shells of patella deaurita mytilus magellanicus the latter retaining much of its colour fusus magellanicus and a variety of the same and a large balanus probably b tulipa all now found on this coast i estimated this bed at from eighty to one hundred feet above the level of the sea to the westward of this bay there is a plain estimated at between and feet in height this plain seems from many measurements to be a continuation of the sandstone platform of the river negro the next place southward where i landed was at port desire miles distant but from the intermediate districts i received through the kindness of the officers of the survey especially from lieut stokes and mr king many specimens and sketches quite sufficient to show the general uniformity of the whole line of coast i may here state that the whole of patagonia consists of a tertiary formation resting on and sometimes surrounding hills of porphyry and quartz the surface is worn into many wide valleys and into level stepformed plains rising one above another all capped by irregular beds of gravel chiefly composed of porphyritic rocks this gravel formation will be separately described at the end of the chapter my object in giving the following measurements of the plains as taken by the officers of the survey is as will hereafter be seen to show the remarkable equability of the recent elevatory movements round the southern parts of nuevo gulf as far as the river chupat seventy miles southward of san josef there appear to be several plains of which the best defined are here represented the upper plain is here well defined called table hills its edge forms a cliff or line of escarpment many miles in length projecting over a lower plain the lowest plain corresponds with that at san josef with the recent shells on its surface between this lowest and the uppermost plain there is probably more than one stepformed terrace several measurements show the existence of the intermediate one of the height given in the diagram near the north headland of the great bay of st george miles south of the chupat two well marked plains of and feet were measured these are said to sweep round a great part of the bay at its south headland miles distant from the north headland the feet plain was again measured in the middle of the bay a higher plain was found at two neighbouring places tilli roads and c marques to be feet in height above this plain towards the interior mr stokes informs me that there were several other stepformed plains the highest of which was estimated at feet and was seen ranging at apparently the same height for miles northward all these plains have been worn into great valleys and much denuded the following section is illustrative of the general structure of the great bay of st george at the south headland of the bay of st george near c three points the plain is very extensive at fort desire forty miles southward i made several measurements with the barometer of a plain which extends along the north side of the port and along the open coast and which varies from to feet in height this plain abuts against the foot of a higher plain of feet which extends also far northward along the coast and likewise into the interior in the distance a higher inland platform was seen of which i do not know the height in three separate places i observed the cliff of the feet plain fringed by a terrace or narrow plain estimated at about feet in height these plains are represented in the following section in many places even at the distance of three and four miles from the coast i found on the gravelcapped surface of the feet and of the feet plain shells of mytilus magellanicus m edulis patella deaurita and another patella too much worn to be identified but apparently similar to one found abundantly adhering to the leaves of the kelp these species are the commonest now living on this coast the shells all appeared very old the blue of the mussels was much faded and only traces of colour could be perceived in the patellas of which the outer surfaces were scaling off they lay scattered on the smooth surface of the gravel but abounded most in certain patches especially at the heads of the smaller valleys they generally contained sand in their insides and i presume that they have been washed by alluvial action out of thin sandy layers traces of which may sometimes be seen covering the gravel the several plains have very level surfaces but all are scooped out by numerous broad winding flatbottomed valleys in which judging from the bushes streams never flow these remarks on the state of the shells and on the nature of the plains apply to the following cases so need not be repeated southward of port desire the plains have been greatly denuded with only small pieces of tableland marking their former extension but opposite bird island two considerable stepformed plains were measured and found respectively to be and feet in height this latter plain extends along the coast close to port st julian miles south of port desire where we have the following section the lowest plain was estimated at ninety feet it is remarkable from the usual gravelbed being deeply worn into hollows which are filled up with as well as the general surface covered by sandy and reddish earthy matter in one of the hollows thus filled up the skeleton of the macrauchenia patachonica as will hereafter be described was embedded on the surface and in the upper parts of this earthy mass there were numerous shells of mytilus magellanicus and m edulis patella deaurita and fragments of other species this plain is tolerably level but not extensive it forms a promontory seven or eight miles long and three or four wide the upper plains in the above diagram were measured by the officers of the survey they were all capped by thick beds of gravel and were all more or less denuded the plain consists merely of separate truncated gravelcapped hills two of which by measurement were found to differ only three feet the feet plain extends apparently with hardly a break to near the northern entrance of the rio santa cruz fifty miles to the south but it was there found to be only feet in height on the southern side of the mouth of the santa cruz we have the following section which i am able to give with more detail than in the foregoing cases the plain marked feet as ascertained by the barometer and by angular measurement is a continuation of the abovementioned feet plain it extends in a nw direction along the southern shores of the estuary it is capped by gravel which in most parts is covered by a thin bed of sandy earth and is scooped out by many flatbottomed valleys it appears to the eye quite level but in proceeding in a ssw course towards an escarpment distant about six miles and likewise ranging across the country in a nw line it was found to rise at first insensibly and then for the last half mile sensibly close up to the base of the escarpment at this point it was feet in height showing a rise of feet in the six miles on this to feet plain i found several shells of mytilus magellanicus and of a mytilus which mr sowerby informs me is yet unnamed though well known as recent on this coast patella deaurita fusus i believe magellanicus but the specimen has been lost and at the distance of four miles from the coast at the height of about feet there were fragments of the same patella and of a voluta apparently v ancilla partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth all these shells had the same ancient appearance with those from the foregoing localities as the tides along this part of the coast rise at the syzygal period forty feet and therefore form a wellmarked beachline i particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this plain which as we have seen rises feet in about six miles but i could not see any traces of such the next highest plain is feet above the sea it is very narrow but level and is capped with gravel it abuts to the foot of the feet plain this summitplain extends as far as the eye can range both inland along the southern side of the valley of the santa cruz and southward along the atlantic the valley of the r santa cruzthis valley runs in an east and west direction to the cordillera a distance of about miles it cuts through the great patagonian tertiary formation including in the upper half of the valley immense streams of basaltic lava which as well as the softer beds are capped by gravel and this gravel high up the river is associated with a vast boulder formation in ascending the valley the plain which at the mouth on the southern side is feet high is seen to trend towards the corresponding plain on the northern side so that their escarpments appear like the shores of a former estuary larger than the existing one the escarpments also of the feet summitplain with a corresponding northern one which is met with some way up the valley appear like the shores of a still larger estuary farther up the valley the sides are bounded throughout its entire length by level gravelcapped terraces rising above each other in steps the width between the upper escarpments is on an average between seven and ten miles in one spot however where cutting through the basaltic lava it was only one mile and a half between the escarpments of the second highest terrace the average width is about four or five miles the bottom of the valley at the distance of miles from its mouth begins sensibly to expand and soon forms a considerable plain feet above the level of the sea through which the river flows in a gut from twenty to forty feet in depth i here found at a point of miles from the atlantic and seventy miles from the nearest creek of the pacific at the height of feet a very old and worn shell of patella deaurita lower down the valley miles from the atlantic long w and at an elevation of about feet i also found in the bed of the river two much worn and broken shells of the voluta ancilla still retaining traces of their colours and one of the patella deaurita it appeared that these shells had been washed from the banks into the river considering the distance from the sea the desert and absolutely unfrequented character of the country and the very ancient appearance of the shells exactly like those found on the plains nearer the coast there is i think no cause to suspect that they could have been brought here by indians the plain at the head of the valley is tolerably level but waterworn and with many sanddunes on it like those on a seacoast at the highest point to which we ascended it was sixteen miles wide in a north and south line and fortyfive miles in length in an east and west line it is bordered by the escarpments one above the other of two plains which diverge as they approach the cordillera and consequently resemble at two levels the shores of great bays facing the mountains and these mountains are breached in front of the lower plain by a remarkable gap the valley therefore of the santa cruz consists of a straight broad cut about ninety miles in length bordered by gravelcapped terraces and plains the escarpments of which at both ends diverge or expand one over the other after the manner of the shores of great bays bearing in mind this peculiar form of the landthe sanddunes on the plain at the head of the valleythe gap in the cordillera in front of itthe presence in two places of very ancient shells of existing speciesand lastly the circumstance of the to feet plain with the numerous marine remains on its surface sweeping from the atlantic coast far up the valley i think we must admit that within the recent period the course of the santa cruz formed a seastrait intersecting the continent at this period the southern part of south america consisted of an archipelago of islands miles in a n and s line we shall presently see that two other straits also since closed then cut through tierra del fuego i may add that one of them must at that time have expanded at the foot of the cordillera into a great bay now otway water like that which formerly covered the feet plain at the head of the santa cruz i have said that the valley in its whole course is bordered by gravelcapped plains the following section supposed to be drawn in a n and s line across the valley can scarcely be considered as more than illustrative for during our hurried ascent it was impossible to measure all the plains at any one place at a point nearly midway between the cordillera and the atlantic i found the plain a north feet above the river all the lower plains on this side were here united into one great broken cliff at a point sixteen miles lower down the stream i found by measurement and estimation that b n was above the river very near to where a n was measured c n was above the same level the terrace d n was nowhere measured the lowest e n was in many places about twenty feet above the river these plains or terraces were best developed where the valley was widest the whole five like gigantic steps occurred together only at a few points the lower terraces are less continuous than the higher ones and appear to be entirely lost in the upper third of the valley terrace c s however was traced continuously for a great distance the terrace b n at a point of fiftyfive miles from the mouth of the river was four miles in width higher up the valley this terrace or at least the second highest one for i could not always trace it continuously was about eight miles wide this second plain was generally wider than the lower onesas indeed follows from the valley from a n to a s being generally nearly double the width of from b n to b s low down the valley the summitplain a s is continuous with the feet plain on the coast but it is soon lost or unites with the escarpment of b s the corresponding plain a n on the north side of the valley appears to range continuously from the cordillera to the head of the present estuary of the s cruz where it trends northward towards port st julian near the cordillera the summitplain on both sides of the valley is between and feet in height at miles from the atlantic it is feet and on the coast feet all above the seabeach so that in a distance of miles the plain rises feet and much more rapidly near to the cordillera the lower terraces b and c also appear to rise as they run up the valley thus d n measured at two points twentyfour miles apart was found to have risen feet from several reasons i suspect that this gradual inclination of the plains up the valley has been chiefly caused by the elevation of the continent in mass having been the greater the nearer to the cordillera all the terraces are capped with wellrounded gravel which rests either on the denuded and sometimes furrowed surface of the soft tertiary deposits or on the basaltic lava the difference in height between some of the lower steps or terraces seems to be entirely owing to a difference in the thickness of the capping gravel furrows and inequalities in the gravel where such occur are filled up and smoothed over with sandy earth the pebbles especially on the higher plains are often whitewashed and even cemented together by a white aluminous substance and i occasionally found this to be the case with the gravel on the terrace d i could not perceive any trace of a similar deposition on the pebbles now thrown up by the river and therefore i do not think that terrace d was riverformed as the terrace e generally stands about twenty feet above the bed of the river my first impression was to doubt whether even this lowest one could have been so formed but it should always be borne in mind that the horizontal upheaval of a district by increasing the total descent of the streams will always tend to increase first near the seacoast and then farther and farther up the valley their corroding and deepening powers so that an alluvial plain formed almost on a level with a stream will after an elevation of this kind in time be cut through and left standing at a height never again to be reached by the water with respect to the three upper terraces of the s cruz i think there can be no doubt that they were modelled by the sea when the valley was occupied by a strait in the same manner hereafter to be discussed as the greater stepformed shellstrewed plains along the coast of patagonia to return to the shores of the atlantic the feet plain at the mouth of the santa cruz is seen extending horizontally far to the south and i am informed by the officers of the survey that bending round the head of coy inlet sixtyfive miles southward it trends inland outliers of apparently the same height are seen forty miles farther south inland of the river gallegos and a plain comes down to cape gregory thirtyfive miles southward in the strait of magellan which was estimated at between and feet in height and which rising towards the interior is capped by the boulder formation south of the strait of magellan there are large outlying masses of apparently the same great tableland extending at intervals along the eastern coast of tierra del fuego at two places here miles apart this plain was found to be and feet in height from coy inlet where the high summitplain trends inland a plain estimated at feet in height extends for forty miles to the river gallegos from this point to the strait of magellan and on each side of that strait the country has been much denuded and is less level it consists chiefly of the boulder formation which rises to a height of between and feet and is often capped by beds of gravel at ns gracia on the north side of the inner narrows of the strait of magellan i found on the summit of a cliff feet in height shells of existing patellæ and mytili scattered on the surface and partially embedded in earth on the eastern coast also of tierra del fuego in latitude s i found many mytili on some level land estimated at feet in height anterior to the elevation attested by these shells it is evident by the present form of the land and by the distribution of the great erratic boulders on the surface that two seachannels connected the strait of magellan both with sebastian bay and with otway water concluding remarks on the recent elevation of the southeastern coasts of america and on the action of the sea on the landupraised shells of species still existing as the commonest kinds in the adjoining sea occur as we have seen at heights of between a few feet and feet at intervals from latitude to south this is a distance of geographical milesabout equal from london to the north cape of sweden as the boulder formation extends with nearly the same height miles south of the most southern point where i landed and found upraised shells and as the level pampas ranges many hundred miles northward of the point where m dorbigny found at the height of feet beds of the azara the space in a north and south line which has been uplifted within the recent period must have been much above the miles by the term recent i refer only to that period within which the now living mollusca were called into existence for it will be seen in the eleventh chapter that both at bahia blanca and p s julian the mammiferous quadrupeds which coexisted with these shells belong to extinct species i have said that the upraised shells were found only at intervals on this line of coast but this in all probability may be attributed to my not having landed at the intermediate points for wherever i did land with the exception of the river negro shells were found moreover the shells are strewed on plains or terraces which as we shall immediately see extend for great distances with a uniform height i ascended the higher plains only in a few places owing to the distance at which their escarpments generally range from the coast so that i am far from knowing that feet is the maximum of elevation of these upraised remains the shells are those now most abundant in a living state in the adjoining sea all of them have an ancient appearance but some especially the mussels although lying fully exposed to the weather retain to a considerable extent their colours this circumstance appears at first surprising but it is now known that the colouring principle of the mytilus is so enduring that it is preserved when the shell itself is completely disintegrated most of the shells are broken i nowhere found two valves united the fragments are not rounded at least in none of the specimens which i brought home with respect to the breadth of the upraised area in an east and west line we know from the shells found at the inner narrows of the strait of magellan that the entire width of the plain although there very narrow has been elevated it is probable that in this southernmost part of the continent the movement has extended under the sea far eastward for at the falkland islands though i could not find any shells the bones of whales have been noticed by several competent observers lying on the land at a considerable distance from the sea and at the height of some hundred feet above it moreover we know that in tierra del fuego the boulder formation has been uplifted within the recent period and a similar formation occurs on the northwestern shores byron sound of these islands the distance from this point to the cordillera of tierra del fuego is miles which we may take as the probable width of the recently upraised area in the latitude of the r santa cruz we know from the shells found at the mouth and head and in the middle of the valley that the entire width about miles of the surface eastward of the cordillera has been upraised from the slope of the plains as shown by the course of the rivers for several degrees northward of the s cruz it is probable that the elevation attested by the shells on the coast has likewise extended to the cordillera when however we look as far northward as the provinces of la plata this conclusion would be very hazardous not only is the distance from maldonado where i found upraised shells to the cordillera great namely miles but at the head of the estuary of the plata a nne and ssw range of tertiary volcanic rocks has been observed which may well indicate an axis of elevation quite distinct from that of the andes moreover in the centre of the pampas in the chain of cordova severe earthquakes have been felt whereas at mendoza at the eastern foot of the cordillera only gentle oscillations transmitted from the shores of the pacific have ever been experienced hence the elevation of the pampas may be due to several distinct axes of movement and we cannot judge from the upraised shells round the estuary of the plata of the breadth of the area uplifted within the recent period not only has the above specified long range of coast been elevated within the recent period but i think it may be safely inferred from the similarity in height of the gravelcapped plains at distant points that there has been a remarkable degree of equability in the elevatory process i may premise that when i measured the plains it was simply to ascertain the heights at which shells occurred afterwards comparing these measurements with some of those made during the survey i was struck with their uniformity and accordingly tabulated all those which represented the summitedges of plains the extension of the to feet plain is very striking being found over a space of geographical miles in a north and south line a table of the measurements is here given the angular measurements and all the estimations are by the officers of the survey the barometrical ones by myself the extension moreover of the to and of the to feet plains is remarkable though somewhat less obvious than in the former cases bearing in mind that i have not picked these measurements out of a series but have used all those which represented the edges of plains i think it scarcely possible that these coincidences in height should be accidental we must therefore conclude that the action whatever it may have been by which these plains have been modelled into their present forms has been singularly uniform these plains or great terraces of which three and four often rise like steps one behind the other are formed by the denudation of the old patagonian tertiary beds and by the deposition on their surfaces of a mass of wellrounded gravel varying near the coast from ten to thirtyfive feet in thickness but increasing in thickness towards the interior the gravel is often capped by a thin irregular bed of sandy earth the plains slope up though seldom sensibly
