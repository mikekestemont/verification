the optic nerve and the dura mater and sometimes as in the xiphias the consoli dated portion of the sclerotic envelopes the ball of the eye like an osseous band with a thickened anterior round margin to receive the circumference of the cornea and to support the periphery of the iris the fatty substance commonly depo sited between the layers of the choroid at the back of the eye in fishes is traversed by numerous branches from the ocular artery and by the ciliary veins returning to the choroid gland the inner of the two layers of the choroid is often distinctly separable into two an exterior formed by the straight parallel ciliary veins and an interior formed by the ramifications of the ciliary arteries on which the pigment rests the optic nerve a g generally presents a con tracted appearance at the place where it penetrates the vas cular layer of the choroid a k and expands into a soft and pulpy retina which terminates by an even margin near the base of the uvea the organs of vision are smallest in anguilliform fishes and such as burrow in the mud or sand they are larger in predaceous fishes which frequent the dark depths of the wide ocean than in those which reside on the shallow coasts or in fresh waters their mobility is encreased in the active muscular plagiostome fishes by being supported on cartilaginous peduncles they are moved in fishes by four recti and two ooliqui muscles as in higher vertebrata they are very rarely directed to one side of the head as in the pleuronectes sometimes the eyelids are so perfect as to be provided with distinct orbicular or sphincter muscles and in several fishes the upper edge of the iris extends down in form of a vine leaf over the middle of the pupil the pearly lustre of the exterior choroid seems due to crystalline spicula and from the deficiency of internal pigment the eyes of many cartilaginous fishes have an internal shining lustre like the tapetum of the eye of quadrupeds the eyes of amphibious animals are generally interme diate in their form and structure between those of fishes which receive the rays of light constantly through the dense medium of water and those of the higher airbreathing classes which receive them through the rare medium of the atmosphere these organs are still therefore of great size and flat in front from the small quantity of aqueous humour especially in the perennibranchiate species which more constantly reside in the water from the imperfect ossification of the orbit the eyes have great lateral extent of motion they are provided with an upper and lower eyelid and a very complete membrana nictitans and as in other oviparous vertebrata the lower eyelid is more developed and more moveable than the upper the eye is large and provided with a thick and firm sclerotic as in fishes in the frog and the toad but is very small in the pipa where it is destitute of eyelids and the crystalline lens is spherical as in most other amphibia and in fishes the outer layer of the choroid has the pearly lustre of that of fishes and passes shining over the forepart of the iris around a pupil still almost motionless the ciliary processes are not developed and the retina forms a thick and pulpy external layer like that of fishes the eyes appear to be still destitute of lachrymal apparatus as in the former class and in the proteus the organs of vision are covered over by the opaque integuments of the head the eyes of reptiles are more adapted to receive the rays of light from the rare medium of the atmosphere than those of fishes or amphibia their cornea is therefore gene rally more convex their aqueous and vitreous humours more abundant and their lens less spherical in form they are generally provided with the ordinary straight and oblique muscles a distinct lachrymal apparatus two moveable eye lids and a membrana nictitans in serpents the skin forming the eyelids passes transparent and continuous over the eyes and their lachrymal organs and the epidermis is thus shed from the closed eye lids as from the rest of the skin the tears here bathe the concealed conjunctiva and pass by the lachrymal duct into the nose as in higher animals but in the slowworm the eyelids and the membrana nictitans are formed as in saurian reptiles the sclerotic is sometimes firm and cartilaginous sometimes it contains adipose sub stance behind the retina as in fishes and in many as the crocodilian reptiles the iguana the lizard and the monitor and the tortoises and turtles the fore part of the sclerotic supports a circle of osseous plates which surround the transparent cornea as in birds these plates around the cornea existed also in the ichthyosaurus the ciliary pro cesses are now considerably developed around the margin of the flattened lens especially in the crocodilian reptiles and the greater freedom and mobility of the iris from the abundance of aqueous humour allows of more extensive and quick changes in the diameter of the pupil than in the inferior vertebrata the pupil is often extended vertically in saurian and ophidian reptiles as in many carnivorous mammalia and a dark pecten in many lacertine and cro codilian reptiles is prolonged from the choroid coat into the vitreous humour as in birds the pulpy and fibrous layers are obvious in the retina and its central foramen is seen in many of the species the eyes of the chamseleon do not move simultaneously the two eyelids are united over the eye excepting a small vertical slit opposite to the middle of the pupil and the concealed membrana nictitans is nearly as large as in birds in the eye of emys europaea fig b the cornea is pretty convex from the abundance of aqueous humour b in the anterior chamber and the margin of the cornea is supported by ten osseous plates c d imbricated like those of birds and placed in the anterior part of the sclerotic b d d near to the ciliary processes b and to the fixed margin of the iris b e the crystalline lens b g has a compressed eliptical form and a smaller axis than the vitreous humour b h the retina terminates with a thickened edge at the beginning of the ciliary pro cesses and a similar structure is presented in most of the chelonian reptiles the eyes of birds are adapted in all their parts for the rare medium through which they receive the rays of light and for sudden changes in the density of that medium and in the intensity of light and for the varying distances and directions of their objects of vision and by their high development and their magnitude they compensate for the imperfect condition of most of the other organs of sense from the lateral position of the eyes and the great projection of the cornea they command an extensive field of vision and from this circumstance and the great mobility of their head and their long neck the large organs of vision of birds are less moveable in their orbits than those of qua drupeds they are the most remote in structure and form from those of fishes which accords with the difference of density in the media of vision and the fluids now most abundant in their interior are the least refractive the aqueous and the vitreous while the crystalline lens is flattened in its form and reduced in the density of its texture and in the space which it occupies in the axis of the eye to prevent the sphericity of the eye from the equal pressure of the contained fluids and to preserve a great convexity of the transparent cornea especially in rapaceous birds the anterior margin of the sclerotic is strengthened by a circular series of quadrangular moveable imbricated osseous plates disposed between its coats around the edge of the cornea as in many reptiles and which often give a conical or even a tubular form to the forepart of the eye as seen in the large nocturnal eyes of the long eared owls the tough posterior mem branous part of the sclerotic forms a great hemisphere occupied almost entirely by the vitreous humour and filling the very large orbits of the cranium and from the quantity of space occupied by the thin and yielding aqueous and vitreous humours in the eyes of birds they are probably more easily and quickly adjusted to the different distances of surrounding objects and to the varying density of the medium through which they see the thin convex dense cornea is here removed to a distance from the iris by the abundant aqueous humour occupying the anterior chamber and from the rapid evaporation of this fluid it quickly sinks to flatness or to a concavity externally after death the cornea is least convex and the eyes are smallest in the aquatic birds where the food is often distinguished more by the sen sibility of the lips than by the organs of vision and they are largest in the nocturnal birds of prey where they are directed forwards with their axes nearly parallel and the pupils are of great size to receive the strongest impression from a feeble light the choroid coat consisting as usual of two layers of a dark colour is lined internally with a thick deposit of black pigment which appears to be com posed of globular particles with a transparent centre and a prolongation of this dark membrane covered with its pigment is extended forwards through the vitreous humour from the lineal entrance of the optic nerve to the capsule of the crystalline lens to which its anterior margin is attached this folded marsupium or pecten continued from the vascular layer of the choroid through the axis of the eye to the lens may convey the central nutritious vessels of these humours or moderate the intensity of the light admitted into the eye or may assist in adapting the eye to different distances by affecting the position or the form of the lens to which it is attached from the ciliary liga ment which unites firmly the choroid to the sclerotic the large ciliary processes extend freely inwards to form a corona around the margin of the lens the ciliary nerves unite to form plexuses at this ciliary ligament and the retinal expansion of the optic nerve appears to terminate internally at the same place plexuses are formed on the ciliary arteries as in similar delicate organs before penetrating the delicate textures of the eye to spread on the ciliary processes the marsupium and the iris which is here remark able for the diversities of lively colours which it presents in the different species from the great mobility of the iris the round pupil of birds is susceptible of great and rapid changes of dimension which are very extensive and almost voluntary in the parrots the optic nerve penetrates the choroid by a lengthened fissure as in many of the lower animals and from this lineal perforation the falciform qua drangular pecten extends forwards through the thin and liquid vitreous humour the bright coloured and highly moveable iris with its black uvea appears sometimes de tached from the free anterior margin of the choroid and its coloured surface presents aggregations of minute globules like those of the choroidal pigment the number of folds in the pecten varies from three or four observed in the goatsucker to nearly thirty observed in several singing birds the eyes of birds are moved by the ordinary four straight and two oblique muscles they are provided with lachrymal glands above and glandulae harderi beneath as in many reptiles their conjunctiva forms always a large pellucid and highly elastic membrana nectitans at the inner angle of the eye moved by two distinct muscles and their lower and upper eye lids are very perfect being already provided with tarsal cartilages meibomian glands and even eyelashes besides the ordinary muscles for their elevation and de pression as some of the mammalia are organized to fly through the air some to walk on the earth or burrow in the interior and others to swim through the dark abyss of the ocean their organs of vision are very differently constructed to adapt them for receiving visual impressions in these different situations they are generally more spherical in their form and consquently more thin and membranous in their tunics and better provided with external means of motion and of protection than in the oviparous classes of vertebrata they have generally a lateral aspect to give greater extent to the field of vision but in nocturnal quadrupeds and in quadrumana and man they are directed forwards with more parallel axes to give greater precision and strength to the visual impressions the eyes are large in most of the lower herbivorous mammalia as the ruminatia the rodentia and most of the pachyderma and also in most of the nocturnal species as we generally find in other classes and they are very small in the adult state of many of the burrowing quadrupeds as moles and shrews in the larger pachyderma and cetacea in the highest mammalia where their axes are nearly parallel and in the cheiroptera where as in aquatic birds their deficiency is compensated for by other organs of sense the same circumstances which modify the form of the eye and the proportions of its refractive parts in other classes of animals affect the organ in this thus in the visual organ of swimming mammalia we observe many affinities with the eyes of fishes those of bats approach to those of birds and intermediate forms are allied to the eyes of reptiles in cetaceous animals which constantly reside in the water and receive the rays of light through that dense refractive medium the eyes have little aqueous humour the cornea is flat the crystalline lens is large dense and spherical and the vitreous humour is less abundant than in terrestial quadrupeds and in order to preserve this flatness of the forepart of the eye the sclerotic coat like that of fishes is here thick firm and elastic especially over the back and the anterior parts of the eye the sclerotic is an inch thick at the back part of the eye in the whale the superior oblique muscle of the eye appears still destitute of a pully for its tendon in the cetacea these lowest aquatic mammalia and they are almost in the condition of fishes in the imperfect development of their eyelids and even of their lachrymal apparatus but the smallness of their visual organs compared with those of fishes accords with the higher development of their in ternal organs of perception and their whole nervous system many intermediate forms of the organs of vision between those of cetacea and those of land quadrupeds are seen in species which have only semiaquatic habits as in walruses otariae seals otters and beavers where the eye gradually becomes more spherical in form its coasts around the middle of the eye more thin and membranous the cornea more convex the crystalline lens more compressed from before backwards and of a softer texture and the glandular and pro tecting apparatus of the eye more complicated and more perfect in structure the large eye of the ruminatia and most other herbivorous quadrupeds accord with the imper fect development of their intellectual organs and they often present a greater lateral than vertical extension of the transparent cornea the pupil and even of the whole eyeball by which the lateral range of vision is extended in these timid and watchful animals during the inclined position of the head the prominent cornea of carnivorous quadrupeds covers a pupil most frequently ex tended in a vertical direction which is that most suited to their leaping and predaceous habits and in the back part of the eye their thick and tough choroid destitute of the pigment which lines the other parts shines with a blue or green coloured metallic lustre a tapetum lucidum which is not seen in the lowest nor in the highest terrestrial animals of this class and which often presents a red colour as in albinos from the exposed vascular layer of the choroid the ciliary ligament is less and the processes are more de veloped than in the inferior classes the iris presents less varied and deep hues than in birds its free edge in the em bryo supports the membrana pupillaris which closes the pupil as the interpulpibral membrane closes the eyelids at the same period of life and where the pupil is elongated transversely as in the horse the upper free margin of the iris presents pendent processes as in the cartilagenous fishes which hang down more or less over the pupil and sometimes they rise up also from the lower edge between the sclerotic and the choroid is a thin brown coloured layer connecting these coats and considered as continuous with the delicate arachnoid covering of the brain and optic nerve at the ciliary ligament the minute canal of fontana is still often per ceptible though less than in birds and the canal of petit surrounds the lens between the vitreous and the aqueous humour the optic nerve penetrates the choroid by a round aperture on the nasal side of the axis of vision but in some of the rodentia as the marmot it enters by a lineal slit in the choroid as in birds and sometimes a rudimentary trans parent pecten is observed in the embryos of mammalia extending forwards through the vitreous humour as in the lower oviparous vertebrata as we ascend through the quadru manous animals to man the eye becomes smaller and more spherical its membranes thinner the vitreous humour more abundant the crystalline lens smaller and more compressed the pupil more circular the ophthalmic ganglion larger the retinal surface more extensive the eyes more approximated and parallel their orbits more completely surrounded with bone and the circular suspensory muscle extending forwards from around the optic foramen to the sclerotic in the inclined heads of inferior mammalia is no longer developed or required for the small eyes and elevated orbits of the quadrumana and man it is however in the visual apparatus of man fig organized for seeing in the erect position of the trunk that we find the most complete protection of the orbits by solid osseous parietes and the most parallel direction of their axes shaded externally by the eyebrows which are moved by corrugator muscles and protected by two highly moveable eyelids formed by the common integuments which continue thin and transparent as a conjunctiva over the fore part of the organ the human eye presents in form of a plica semi lunaris only a small rudiment of the third eyelid or membrana nictitans so highly developed in most of the inferior vertebrata the upper eyelid is now the largest and the most moveable both eyelids are supported by tarsal cartilages they are provided with long cilia symmetrically formed and disposed arid with numerous glandular follicles or meibomian glands which pour out their secretion by minute pores along the inner margins of the eyelids and the eyelid is perforated within by the several ducts pro ceeding from the lobules of a large lachrymal gland situate in the upper and outer part of the orbit there are three or four irregular rows of cilia in each eyelid which are more numerous and larger in the upper than in the lower and in crease in size from the two angles to the middle of the eyelids the large upper eyelid has its proper levator muscle which is not required in the lower and both are closed by the orbicularis palpebrarum the glandula harderi so large in the inferior quadrupeds and birds where the third eye lid is fully developed is here as in the quadrumana reduced to the small follicles of the caruncula lachrymalis as the great membrana nictitans is now merely a small plica semilunaris at the inner angle of the eye the lympid fluid from the bilobate lachrymal gland conveyed by the upper eyelid over the conjunctiva passes through the two puncta lachry malia near the inner angle of the eye and through the two small lachrymal ducts to their dilated sac and tapering canal from which it is poured by a valvular orifice into the anterior part of the inferior meatus of the nose the eyeballs nearly spherical in form with their axes parallel and perforated behind by the optic nerves on the nasal side of their axes are supported on the back part by a large deposit of adipose substance and are moved by four recti and two oblique muscles the tendon of the superior oblique is not perforated by the rectus su perior o as it is in many feline animals the muscles are inserted into the white anterior part of the sclerotic called tunica albuginea and the optic nerve per forates a circular cribriform portion of this membrane behind the central minute aperture of which is occupied by the central artery of the retina which passes through the middle of the optic nerve a the transparent cornea com posed of homogeneous concentric laminae thicker and more convex than the sclerotic has still its transverse diameter a little more extended than its vertical the choroid is firmly united to the sclerotic at the white ciliary ligament a line in breadth and is perforated by a circular aperture behind for the transmission of the optic nerve and from the anterior margin of this ligament proceed the numerous minute folds of the corpus ciliare which give attachment to about seventy ciliary processes extending with their convex margins internally to be united to the capsule of the crystalline lens the villous internal surface of the vascular layer of the choroid secretes a layer of variable thickness of a muscous and viscid pigmentum nigrum this appears to be immediately lined with the delicate transparent membrane of jacob within which are the me dullary and fibrous layers of the retina d and the several concentric layers of the hyaloid membrane of the vi treous humour the iris composed chiefly of radiating vessels and nerves disposed in two concentric rings is attached to the anterior part of the choroid around the ciliary liga ment arid divides the cavity for the aqueous humour into two unequal chambers which communicate by the pupil it is variously coloured on its anterior surface and supports on its backpart the uvea which is covered with the black pigment of the choroid a little exterior to the entrance of the optic nerve a small fold of the retina is observed and a yellow spot with a minute round transparent portion of the retina the uses of which are unknown the vitreous humour of a gelatinous consistence and contained within the concentric folds of the hyaloid membrane occu pies about twothirds of the axis of the eye and its delicate membrane embraces also the crystalline lens with its firm capsule and forms around its edge the circular canal of petit the crystalline lens here comparatively small and soft has its posterior surface as usual more convex than the anterior and both are most convex at the earliest periods of life the aqueous humour enveloped in a delicate capsule which forms the membrana pupillaris by extending over the pupil in the embryo occupies a large anterior and a smaller posterior chamber giving the necessary convexity to the cornea and facilitating the free motions of the iris thus we observe these complicated optical instruments the most universal and the noblest organs of sense gradually advancing to perfection from the monad to man where all their internal essential parts and all their external accessary appa ratus are the most exquisitely finished and adjusted and it is chiefly through their means that he is enabled to provide for his wants to acquire the materials of thought and to enjoy the sublime spectacle of nature third section organs of hearing the organs of hearing are next to those of vision in their importance and in the universality of their occurrence in the animal kingdom where they are distinctly perceived both in the molluscous and articulated tribes and they relate to movements of the surrounding element which give notice of objects at a distance the percussions given by outward bodies to the air or water in which animals reside are communicated like undulations of light to the general surface of their body and may produce some feeble sensation where there are yet no distinct acoustic instru ments developed as light appears to affect many organized beings without eyes but most of the higher invertebrated animals and all the vertebrata present at the distal expanded soft extremities of distinct auditory nerves more or less complicated acoustic instruments adapted to receive and transmit sonorous undulations and to render more distinct the perception of their force their direction and their ra pidity of succession these like most of the other organs of sense are disposed symmetrically on the two sides of the head and the impression of sound may be communicated to the auditory nerves without passing through the external acoustic apparatus as by means of the solid parietes of the head or by direct impression on the nerves from within from the structure of the organ of hearing it is more adapted for communicating aereal vibrations than those of water and it is most general and most developed in the airbreathing classes the sudden percussions communicated by various means to the dense watery element in which most of the lower invertebrata reside may affect rapidly and powerfully the whole surface of their body whether naked or covered with hard vibratile parts and through that means the most sensitive internal parts without these animals having special acoustic organs to concentrate the undulations and direct them to particular nerves and we ascend as high as the activeairbreathing insects before we perceive distinct organs appropriated to this sense many insects have hard organs for producing audible sounds by their rapid attrition against each other and these sounds are often heard and repeated by their mates being a means of communication between the sexes especially in the darkness of the night the organ of hearing in insects already presents not only a distinct auditory nerve and vestibule the first and most essential elements of all this acoustic apparatus but also the rudi ments of two semicircular canals according to the obser vations of camparetti on that of the scarabseus and several other genera of insects at the lower and lateral part of the head there is a minute round passage closed externally by a membrane and leading on each side of the head to an internal vestibular sac with two small curved canals ex tending from it these vestibular cavities are furnished with distinct nervous filaments which appear to be branches of the antenneal nerves and they constitute an acoustic organ which has been observed in many different forms of this class they are placed more anteriorly on the head of the locusts where the minute canals are thin membranous and transparent and this organ presents different degrees of development in different species of locusts similar audi tory organs have been detected in the cicada vespa libelluke and at the sides of the base of the long spiral proboscis of the papiliones they are perceived also in ants flies and other insects belonging almost to every order of this great class this delicate organ contained entirely within the cranial cavity of insects is provided with a vestibular opening or fenestra ovalis covered with a thin and tense membrane to receive the sonorous undulations of the air and to convey them to the entolymph of these membranous cavities and so to the expanded surface of the surrounding delicate auditory nerves these organs have been also dissected and described in many insects by ramdohr who observed them in the common bee placed near the base of the maxillae treviramus found those of the blatta orientalis placed behind the basis of the antennae and closed by an oval white concave vestibular membrane and blainville found them in the cicadae which distinctly hear on each side of the back part of the head in form of two minute open stigmata leading to vestibular sacs but many entomologists as straus and burmeister are inclined to place the auditory organs of insects in the antennae themselves in the class of arachnida which also breathe and reside in air organs of hearing very similar to those of insects were detected by camparetti in the spiders placed near to the mouth at the bases of the palpi and consisting of a vestibular sac covered by a transparent membrane through which the auditory nerves could be per ceived the density of texture and the deep hues of the exterior covering of the head in these airbreathing entomoid classes and the softness and transparency of the vestibular membrane which receives the sonorous vibrations render more obvious the position and nature of the organs of hearing in them than if the whole exterior of the body were covered with a more soft and uniform skin and it is pro bably in part from this circumstance that a more simple rudiment of these important organs has not hitherto been observed in the higher forms of helminthoid animals which already present the rudiments of almost all the complex organs of insects from the thick and solid calcareous covering of the body in the higher crustacea their organs of hearing with their exposed vestibular membrane are most obvious especially in the active macrurous decapods as the lobster and crayfish where they present a prominent circular aperture covered with a thin membrane and situate at the bases of the outer pair of antennee this exterior covering is calcined in some of the brachyurous species as the maja and appears to form a loose operculum provided with distinct muscles for its movements within this simple vestibular cavity is a white soft lengthened sac or membranous labyrinth filled with a transparent ento lymph and supporting the small fibrils of an acoustic nerve derived from the great supra oesophageal ganglia it passes obliquely upwards for a short distance into the first segment of the antennae and appears to be still destitute of those solid internal lapilli or cretaceous substances which are commonly found in the labyrinths of higher animals by opening on the lower and not the upper surface of the antennee the position of its aperture corresponds with the inverted position of nearly all the other organs of these animals the exterior margins of this vestibular opening or fenestra ovalis are often prominent and almost tubular as in the pagurus where the covering membrane appears fibrous like the membrana tympani of mammalia the concealed condition of this organ under a solid calcified covering in the brachyurous species accords with their more limited powers of swimming and is analogous to the con cealed position of the organs of hearing within the cranium of cephalopods and osseous fishes these organs have a large vestibular membrane in the palinurus they appear as small tubercles in the palaemon and in most of the inferior orders of crustacea no trace of them can be perceived the slowmoving molluscous animals are less provided with organs for perceiving the properties of outward bodies than the active articulated classes but many of the higher pulmonated gasteropods seem both to hear and to smell although the precise seats of these feelings have not been determined and the tritonia arborescens emits audible sounds under water which are without doubt intended to be heard by others of the same species as we see in insects and probably to serve as a means of communication between these hermaphrodite and almost blind animals although the organs have not been detected which are appropriated to their perception the cephalopods which of all the in vertebrata approach the nearest to fishes in their general form structure and movements come next to them in the complexriess of their organs of hearing as well as in those of sight these organs in the cephalopods as in osseous fishes are symmetrical and double placed within the pa rietes of the cranium and destitute of external meatus or vestibular membrane on the sides of the great cephalic cartilage through which the oesophagus passes and which envelopes the brain we observe two depressions within the cranial cavity at its lower part which are separated by a tough dura mater form the cerebral ganglia these cavities are separated from each other and from the exterior mus cular parts by the cartilaginous substance of the skull and they contain each a membraneous sac or soft labyrinth which is surrounded by the exterior lymph of cotunnius or perilymph the membranous labyrinth on which the acoustic nerves are distributed is filled with a thin ento lymph and encloses a solid chalky lapillus of various forms in different species composed of carbonate of lime pre senting sometimes the appearance of a crystallized rhomboid and suspended by nervous filaments numerous minute blood vessels are seen accompanying the filaments of the acoustic nerves on the parietes of these vestibular sacs this calcareous substance like that of the sacculi in the labyrinths of higher animals serves to communicate more uniformly and distinctly to the accoustic nerves the vibra tions transmitted to this part of the head the organs of hearing being here enclosed in the thickest and densest part of the great cephalic curved plate into which the strong muscles of the arms are inserted in the octopus ven tricosus this cretaceous body is conical like a limpet of a rosered colour on its round exterior tapering surface white and hollow on the base which rests on the vestibular membrane and it is connected as in higher animals to the side of the vestibule by numerous nervous filaments the ento and periacoustic lymph seen here in the vestibule corresponds with that found in the entomoid articulata and in the ears of vertebrated animals and notwithstanding the magnitude and constancy of the auditory organs in the naked cephalopods and their presenting the most complex form met with in the invertebrated classes they are yet reduced almost to the first rudiment or most essential element of the auditory apparatus the vestibular sac with its acoustic nerve in tracing this organ upwards through the vertebrated classes we find it gradually perfecting the semicirculajr canals developing a cochlea from the vestibule and enveloping the whole of this complex labyrinth within the solid texture of the cranium it acquires in the airbreathing animals a tympanic cavity communicating with the fauces by the eustachian tube and containing ossicula auditus which transmit the vibrations of the membrana tympani to the vestibule and the whole internal labyrinth and in the highest conditions of the organ a still more exterior meatus auditorius and complicated moveable concha are added to complete this acoustic instrument fishes like the cepha lopods receive their auditory sensations through the dense watery element they inhabit the undulations of which strike forcibly the whole surface of their head and trunk so that they less require any external means of concentrating sono rous vibrations or a complicated internal auditory apparatus than animals which hear through a thin and rare aerial medium in the lowest cyclostome cartilaginous fishes as the lamprey the whole internal ear is nearly in the same condition as in the cephalopods consisting of a simple shut vestibule without fenestra ovalis enclosed in the cartilagi nous substance of the cranium without internal calcareous concretions and even without distinct semicircular canals these canals being only represented by three perceptible folds of the vestibular membrane these two vestibular cavities lodged in the lower and lateral parts of the skull are still separated from the cranial cavity only by the dura mater and are pierced only by the acoustic nerves and blood vessels which spread on the vestibular membranes between the peri and entolymph but in the higher osseous fishes we find in addition to a highly developed vestibule containing solid calcareous bodies and even sometimes perforated externally by a fenestra ovalis distinct large free semicircular canals with considerable ampullae at their terminations as in other ver tebrated classes these parts however of the acoustic apparatus are not yet imbedded in or surrounded by the solid bones of the head but are simply lodged in a de pression on each side within the general cavity of the skull there is generally no external fenestra or vestibular opening in osseous fishes and the sonorous impulses communicated to the body of the animal through the dense medium of the water are commonly conveyed to the airsac of the trunk which is often bifurcated or even ramified and from that forwards to the base of the skull or into its interior near the ear and sometimes distinct small costal bones detached from the transverse processes of the anterior vertebrae assist in communicating these vibrations from the airsac to the organ of hearing these bones however are ordinary ele ments of the vertebrae and the airsac is the rudiment of the lungs and not analogous to the tympanic cavity of air breathing animals the great size and length of the semi circular canals within the cranial cavity of osseous fishes where they are not yet enclosed within the substance of the temporal bone corresponds with the great development exter nally of the tympanic ossicula composing the opercular bones which are likewise unrestrained by any tympanic membrane or osseous walls in their extension outwards although in the osseous fishes the whole labyrinth lies in an open groove on each side entirely within the general cavity of the skull separated from the brain only by the dura mater and con nected only by ligaments with the temporal bone we find in the sturgeon an operculated cartilaginous fish that the labyrinth is already partly buried in the substance of the temporal bone which envelopes the three semicircular canals and leaves the vestibule still free within the cavity of the cranium in the higher forms of cartilaginous fishes how ever in the rays and sharks the whole labyrinth is at length found to be completely surrounded by the firm elastic car tilaginous substance of the skull excepting at the internal entrances of the vessels and nerves and at the fenestra ovalis which now communicates with an external meatus the external meatus is already seen in some of the osseous fishes as in the large ears of the lepidoleprus in the sharks it is more distinct though closed externally by the skin and in the rays it is even double on each side as if to form a rudiment of the eustachian tube the spiracula of these animals having no relation to the organs of hearing this imbedded condition of the organ in the cartilaginous fishes better enables them to perceive all the sonorous vibrations com municated to the soft substance of their skull and we find the whole internal ear preserve this position so favourable for receiving vibration even in the densest forms of the skull from the cartilaginous fishes up to man the cre taceous substances generally three in number found within the vestibular succulum and its communicating smaller sacculi are soft and pulpy in the cartilaginous fishes and of a stony density in those which have an osseous skeleton they vary in shape according to the species they are normal parts of the auditory organ in most animals from the cephalopods to man they are composed of minute rhomboidal crystals of carbonate of lime and are desti tute of internal organization like the excreted shells of molluscous animals the succuli of the vestibule in these lowest forms of the ear appear to form the first rudiment of a cochlea and a rudiment of the tympanum is seen in the subcutaneous passage destitute of air leading from the fenestra ovalis to the surface of the head in the highest cartilaginous fishes the acoustic nerve comes off sepa rately in fishes from the inferior part of their lobed medulla oblongata beneath the cerebellum and sends branches to be distributed on the ampullae of the semicircular canals on the vestibule and on the sacculus or the yet undivided and unconvoluted rudiment of the cochlea so that its branches are most affected by vibrations in these two last cavities by the solid cretaceous bodies they contain and the vestibule and semicircular canals are the first parts which become imbedded in the substance of the temporal bone in some fishes as the lophius where the skeleton is of a semiosseous consistence the canals are already partially imbedded in the substance of the cranial parietes by their passing round a process of the temporal bone the perennibranchiate amphibia being like the fishes permanent inhabitants of the water and receiving their so norous vibrations through that dense medium are still destitute of a tympanic cavity and consequently of a eus tachian tube which are parts of the organ first required and first developed in those species which lose their gills and change their aquatic for an aerial element in these aquatic species the labyrinth is still imperfectly enclosed in a spacious general cavity of the temporal bone the vestibule communicates externally by the fenestra ovalis to which the stapes is applied as in all the higher classes of animals but is here in form of an operculum as in fishes there is no tympanic cavity or membrane the semicircular canals and the vestibule with its sacculus and lapilli are formed like those of osseous fishes but with the sacculus propor tionably small and the muscles and integuments still cover the exterior of the organ without leaving a trace of external meatus so that the auditory vibrations from without are here obscurely conveyed as in fishes through the solid walls of the cranium the same simple condition of these acoustic organs is seen in the caecilia and appears to be possessed by the larvae of all the higher caducibranchiate amphibia but in the adult state of the frogs and sala manders we find the semicircular canals already imbedded in the substance of the temporal bone and the rest of the labyrinth still free in the original general cavity of that bone as we observe in the sturgeon among the cartilaginous fishes the lapilli here form a soft white pulpy calcareous substance and a small tympanic cavity filled with air communicating with the fauces and confining the small united ossicula is now found between the labyrinth and the skin of the head the eustachiaii tubes leading from the tympanum to the fauces are generally separated throughout wide and short sometimes they unite to open by a single aperture on the median plain as in several frogs and in the pipa and in some a canal is found prolonged outwards from the fenestra rotunda the thin and naked skin forms in these air breathing amphibia a large membrana tympani on a level with the general surface of the head to the centre of which membrane the bent cartilaginous malleus is attached and from the soft condition of the tympanic ossicula the sonorous vibrations communicated from without to the large expanded membrana tympani are obscurely conveyed to the fenestra ovalis to which the broad base of the stapes is applied in the airbreathing reptiles the organs of hearing present a higher condition of development than in the semiaquatic tribes of amphibious animals especially in the parts which more immediately relate to the rare medium through which their sonorous impressions are received the tympanic por tion of the ear is still however so imperfectly developed in the serpents that we find it covered externally not only by the skin and muscles as in fishes and branchiated amphibia but also by the hard scales of the head the three tympanic ossicula are united together into a single piece as in the frogs which is still cartilaginous at its distal or malleal extremity where it is attached to the inner surface of the membrana tympani the semicircular canals with their ento and perilymph as in fishes and amphibia are imbedded in the dense petrous portions of their solid temporal bones the vestibule is still lodged in a capacious cavity of the tem poral bone and its sacculus contains a large and solid creta ceous body so that the solid lapilli of serpents more resemble those of osseous fishes while the soft and pulpy cretaceous substances of the labyrinth of amphibia are allied to those of cartilaginous fishes and they are softer in the chelonian than in the saurian reptiles the cavity of the tympanum is ge nerally much larger in the saurian than in the ophidian reptiles and is covered externally by a thin projected trans parent naked membranous continuation of the skin placed on a level with the general surface of the head so as yet to present no external auditory meatus this cavity communi cates freely with the fauces by a separate eustachian tube and by means of the fenestra ovalis with the labyrinth which still presents only a rudimentary undivided cochlea closed externally by the membrane of the fenestra rotunda and a solid calcareous lapillus as in the serpents the stapes with its base applied to the fenestra ovalis continues to be the principal ossiculum ossified in the tympanum and the tympanic cavity begins to assume a more lengthened tubular form towards its exterior membrane preparatory to the formation of an external auditory meatus and expanded concha to collect and direct the vibra tions of the air in some of the saurian reptiles the mem brana tympani is still covered as in many serpents by the ordinary scales of the head in most it is quite naked and exposed as it is in the frogs and the salamanders and in the most elevated forms of the sauria it begins to be protected by external overhanging elastic folds of the skin forming thus a distinct rudimentary concha as seen in the crocodiles the gavials and the alligators the internal parts of the ear are nearly in the same condition in the chelonian reptiles which present a more narrow and lengthened tympanic cavity covered externally by the loose integuments of the head and communicating with the fauces by a wide semi cartilaginous and distinct eustachian tube the three anchilosed tympanic ossicula still constitute a long stiliform bone with its opercular or stapeal piece applied to the fenes tra ovalis and attached by its outer rounded malleal ex tremity to the middle of the membrana tympani as in the other orders of reptiles the vestibule enveloped with its sacculus and the semicircular canals in the substance of the temporal bone is provided with solid lapilli supported by the filaments of the acoustic nerves and with a compara tively large cochlea though still undivided by an internal lamina and unconvoluted in its form so that the cochlea appears to be the last part of the internal ear which acquires its normal and perfect form but in the crocodilian reptiles it already presents a slightly curved form and an internal membrane which supports branches of the acoustic nerves and divides it into a scala tympani communicating with the fe nestra rotunda and a scala vestibuli continuous with the general cavity of the vestibule and membranous labyrinth notwithstanding the gelatinous consistence of the ento lymph which fills the membranous labyrinth of the cold blooded as well as the higher vertebrata resembling the vitreous humour of the eye no cellular tissue or folds of a hyaloid membrane have been observed to pervade its sub stance nor in the more abundant and fluid perilymph which envelopes these delicate parts and separates them from the solid parietes of the osseous labyrinth the soft lapilli of the labyrinth of vertebrated animals appear to consist of minute rhomboidal crystals of carbonate of lime like those often found lining the intervertebral foramina in other parts of the vertebral column the dense bones of the skull of birds closely envelope every portion of their internal ear with a vibratile covering of great hardness and corresponding with the rare elastic medium they inhabit the semicircular canals so large and free in the cranium of osseous fishes are here even more reduced in their dimensions than in reptiles especially in the water birds but with enlarged ampuke at their ends for the auditory nerves the vestibule is narrow but more lengthened and the cochlea has assumed a more curved and spiral form than even in the crocodiles its spiral partition formed by two triangular cartilaginous folds extending nearly to its apex partially divides it into a vestibular and a tympanic portion communicating with the two foramina of the vestibule and communicating with each other at the apex in the dilated infundibulum or lagena the cretaceous lapilli so large in the membranous labyrinth of fishes and amphibia are now greatly reduced and appear only in the form of strata of minute calcar eous crystals the semicircular canals are long and narrow in the rapaceous birds large and wide in the singing birds and comparatively small short and wide in the grallatores the palmipeds and the gallinaceous birds the tympanic cavity lengthened like the vestibule has here a short external meatus beyond the projecting convex membrana tympani to which the cartilaginous malleal end of the anchylosed tympanic ossicula is attached not only the tympanic cavity is here surrounded by solid bone but also the short wide eustachian tubes which sometimes unite together be fore they open into the posterior nares and the drum of the ear has its internal dimensions greatly encreased by the nu merous aircells of the diploe over the greater part of the cranium which now communicate freely with the interior of both tympana the short external auditory meatus removes the membrana tympani from the level of the general surface of the head and the exterior concha the last part of the auditory organ to be developed presents itself as a simple crescentic fold of the skin extending upwards from the su perior margin of the external meatus this rudimentary concha is perceptible in most birds which can erect or de press the feathers which bound its upper margin but it is most developed in the nocturnal predaceous birds which most require this sense to direct them to their prey in the night the extent of this crescentic membranous concha is encreased in some of the owls by the long feathers which radiate from around its free margin and it is raised or depressed at will like a valve or an eyelid the solid pa rietes of the tympanum are pierced by several foramina which lead to the large cells between the two tables of the skull as those in the tympanum of man and quadrupeds lead to the mastoid cells and the tympanic cavity is here traversed by the vidian nerve as in mammalia the cartilaginous malleal portion of the single long tympanic ossiculum divides into three parts where it is attached to the inner surface of the membrana tympani but in place of the three muscles of the malleus observed in man and quadrupeds there is here but one long muscle which extends forwards from near the occipital condyle to the exterior end of the malleus we thus arrive at the most perfect condition of this com plex acoustic instrument presented by the inammifervus animals where all its internal essential parts and all its external accessory apparatus have attained their full deve lopment the petrous portion of the temporal bone of great density embraces closely all the most important in ternal parts and the exterior concha for collecting the sonorous vibrations and directing them to the membrana tympani is generally of great size the thin membranous labyrinth highly vascular and of exquisite delicacy is filled with a fluid entolymph enveloping two cretaceous bodies composed of minute calcareous crystals and analogous to those found in the labyrinth of fishes and even of many in vertebrated animals these two cretaceous bodies nearly of equal size are contained one in the large sacculus of the vestibule and the other in the long elliptical sacculus formed by the meeting of the semicircular canals near their ampullae and they are supported by the delicate expanded extremities of distinct branches of the acoustic nerves as in the inferior classes the membranous labyrinth is surrounded externally with a copious transparent thin and colourless perilymph which separates it from the periosteum lining the interior parietes of the osseous labyrinth the membranous semicircular canals and their ampullae are comparatively slender their median portion forms the larger part of the broad short and irregular vestibule and its lapillus corres ponds with the utricular of fishes the sacculus vestibuli and its lapillus are proportionally small and the cochlea forms a large turbinated cavity divided longitudinally throughout by an internal solid spiral lamina forming from two to four spiral turns but in the ornithorhyncus it is as simple as in birds as in the inferior vertebrata the exterior semicircular canal extends outwards horizontally and at right angles to the other two and the anterior and posterior unite together to form a common canal before entering the vestibule their direction being nearly vertical with relation to the floor of the cranium the nerves of the membranous labyrinth are chiefly confined to the ampullae of the semi circular canals and to the two sacs containing lapilli and the two lapilli are proportionally larger in the foetus than in the adult the osseous spiral lamina dividing longi tudinally the interior of the convoluted cochlea is still membranous at its peripheral margin and the scala vestibuli communicates freely with the scala tympani at its dilated apex where it receives a branch of the acoustic nerve but no nervous brandies are perceived on the membranous semicir cular canals the two vestibular openings vary much in their form and size in different mammalia and the aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea appear connected the one inter nally with the dura mater and the other externally with the periosteum the cochlea is of a narrow lengthened spiral form in many of the rodentia more short and orbi cular in the cetacea and in most of the higher orders of quadrupeds it forms a turbinated cavity with about two turns and a half as in the human ear the tympanic cavity im bedded in the temporal bone communicating by several aper tures with the mastoid cells and by a lengthened ossified eustachian tube with the fauces is bounded by a thin fibrous membrana tympani concave externally and contains four ossicula articulated moveably with each other and provided with distinct muscles for their movements the external meatus is now increased in length bounded by ossious walls defended internally by short hairs and by an acrid secretion from its parietes and generally terminated ex ternally by an expanded cartilaginous concha variously formed and developed which is adapted by its mobility and its conical shape to collect the sonorous vibrations from different directions and to convey them to the internal ear the concha is generally very small or wanting in the aquatic mammalia in the cetacea where the cochlea is often very large and the semicircular canals comparatively small we observe only a narrow winding perforation leading out wards from the membrana tympani to the surface of the head there is no external concha and the minute entrance to the meatus is scarcely perceptible on the surface of the skin the concha is still wanting in the seals and walruses and is very small in otarise beavers otters and other diving mammalia it is deficient in the ornithorhyncus and in several digging animals as the mole and the manis the monotrema are also distinguished by several other marks of inferiority in their organs of hearing by which they are allied to birds and reptiles as the shortness of the external meatus the anchylosis of the ossicula auditus the rudi mentary state of the cochlea and the free projection of the osseous semicircular canals into the cavity of the cranium as we ascend through the tribes of mammalia that live more exclusively upon the land we find the exterior cartilaginous concha acquiring greater magnitude and symmetry and by the articulation of the cartilage and the great development of its muscular apparatus it acquires the means of more varied and extensive motion it is largest most moveable and commonly directed backwards in the timid and feeble rodentia ruminantia pachyderma and other herbivorous quadrupeds where the cerebral hemispheres are proportionally small and it is least and directed forwards in the carni verous tribes where the brain is large it is large however in the bats and most nocturnal quadrupeds and we observe it in the quadrumana especially in gibbons and orangs gradually acquiring the short flat round form and motion less character of the human concha the internal ear of man like that of inferior mammalia has its membranous labyrinth filled with an ento lymph and separated by a thin perilymph from its osseous parieties the auditory nerves as in other vertebrated animals spread on the ampullae of the semicircular tubes and supporting the cretaceous lapilli of the median sinus and the succulus can receive their im pressions only from the undulations of this fluid medium the minute component crystals of the two cretaceous lapilli of the vestibule are loosely aggregated together as in the cartilaginous fishes and in all the higher vertebrata and the membranous labyrinth is separated from the fenestra ovalis by the perilymph and by the membrane of that orifice so that this thin enveloping perilymph receives the sonorous vibrations from the tympanum and transmits them to the sensitive parts of the membranous labyrinth the aqueducts appear to be but vascular foramina the anterior auditory nerve accompanied by the facial passes to the two anterior ampullae and to the cretaceous lapillus of the median sinus and the posterior auditory branch passes to the posterior ampulla to the saccular lapillus and to the cochlea as in the inferior vertebrated classes so that there is great uniformity of plan in the structure of this delicate acoustic organ from the simple vestibule of the articulata to its most complex form in the highest mammalia where the different densities and forms of the pulpy granular lapilli the gelatinous entolymph and the thin fluid of cotunnius regulate and limit each others vi brations and approximate the phenomena of hearing to the undulations of light through the various humours of the visual organs fourth section organs of smell the organs of smell which are destined to receive and transmit the impressions of odorous particles diffused through the medium in which animals live are much simpler in their structure and more difficult to determine in the in ferior tribes of animals than those of sight or hearing and they appear also to be less important for the preservation of life and less general in their occurrence throughout the animal kingdom it does not appear that the radiated animals have distinct organs to enable them to be sensibly affected by odorous effluvia but the airbreathing annelides among the articulata have been supposed to perceive them by the parietes of their mouth or by the lateral pores of their air sacs the sense of smell so distinctly manifested and so delicate in insects has also been referred to the same parts of their body or to their palpi or to their cesophageal sacs or to the delicate subdivided laminated extremities of their long flexible antennae and the inner pair of these organs in the crustacea have been considered as the seat
