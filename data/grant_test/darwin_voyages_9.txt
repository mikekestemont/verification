to collect sea eggs or sit patiently in their canoes and with a baited hairline jerk out small fish if a seal is killed or the floating carcass of a putrid whale discovered it is a feast such miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi nor are they exempt from famine and as a consequence cannibalism accompanied by parricide the tribes have no government or head yet each is surrounded by other hostile ones speaking different dialects and the cause of their warfare would appear to be the means of subsistence their country is a broken mass of wild rock lofty hills and useless forests and these are viewed through mists and endless storms the habitable land is reduced to the stones which form the beach in search of food they are compelled to wander from spot to spot and so steep is the coast that they can only move about in their wretched canoes they cannot know the feeling of having a home and still less that of domestic affection unless indeed the treatment of a master to a laborious slave can be considered as such how little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into play what is there for imagination to picture for reason to compare for judgment to decide upon to knock a limpet from the rock does not even require cunning that lowest power of the mind their skill in some respects may be compared to the instinct of animals for it is not improved by experience the canoe their most ingenious work poor as it is has remained the same for the last two hundred and fifty years whilst beholding these savages one asks whence have they come what could have tempted or what change compelled a tribe of men to leave the fine regions of the north to travel down the cordillera or backbone of america to invent and build canoes and then to enter on one of the most inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe although such reflections must at first occupy ones mind yet we may feel sure that many of them are quite erroneous there is no reason to believe that the fuegians decrease in number therefore we must suppose that they enjoy a sufficient share of happiness of whatever kind it may be to render life worth having nature by making habit omnipotent and its effects hereditary has fitted the fuegian to the climate and the productions of his country january th the beagle anchored in goeree roads captain fitzroy having determined to settle the fuegians according to their wishes in ponsonby sound four boats were equipped to carry them there through the beagle channel this channel which was discovered by captain fitzroy during the last voyage is a most remarkable feature in the geography of this or indeed of any other country its length is about miles with an average breadth not subject to any very great variations of about two miles it is throughout the greater part so extremely straight that the view bounded on each side by a line of mountains gradually becomes indistinct in the perspective this arm of the sea may be compared to the valley of lochness in scotland with its chain of lakes and entering friths at some future epoch the resemblance perhaps will become complete already in one part we have proofs of a rising of the land in a line of cliff or terrace composed of coarse sandstone mud and shingle which forms both shores the beagle channel crosses the southern part of tierra del fuego in an east and west line in its middle it is joined on the south side by an irregular channel at right angles to it which has been called ponsonby sound this is the residence of jemmy buttons tribe and family january ththree whale boats and the yawl with a party of twentyeight started under the command of captain fitzroy in the afternoon we entered the eastern mouth of the channel and shortly afterwards found a snug little cove concealed by some surrounding islets here we pitched our tents and lighted our fires nothing could look more comfortable than this scene the glassy water of the little harbour with the trees sending their branches over the rocky beach the boats at anchor the tents supported by the crossed oars and the smoke curling up the wooded valley formed a picture of quiet retirement the next day th we smoothly glided onwards in our little fleet and came to a more inhabited district few if any of these natives could ever have seen a white man certainly nothing could exceed their astonishment at the apparition of the four boats fires were lighted on every point hence the name of the land both to attract our attention and to spread far and wide the news some of the men ran for miles along the shore as we passed under one cliff four or five men suddenly appeared above us forming the most wild and savage group that can be imagined they were absolutely naked with long streaming hair and with rugged staffs in their hands springing from the ground they waved their arms around their heads and sent forth the most hideous yells at dinnertime we landed among a party of fuegians at first they were not inclined to be friendly for until the captain pulled in ahead of the other boats they kept their slings in their hands we soon however delighted them by trifling presents such as tying red tape round their heads it was as easy to please as it was difficult to satisfy these savages young and old men and children never ceased repeating the word yammerschooner which means give me after pointing to almost every object one after the other even to the buttons on our coats and saying their favourite word in as many intonations as possible they would then use it in a neuter sense and vacantly repeat yammerschooner after yammerschoonering for any article very eagerly they would by a simple artifice point to their young women or little children as much as to say if you will not give it me surely you will to such as these at night we endeavoured in vain to find an uninhabited cove and at last were obliged to bivouac not far from a party of natives they were very inoffensive as long as they were few in numbers but in the morning st being joined by others they showed symptoms of hostility an european labours under great disadvantages when treating with savages like these who have not the least idea of the power of firearms in the very act of levelling his musket he appears to the savage far inferior to a man armed with a bow and arrow a spear or even a sling nor is it easy to teach them our superiority except by striking a fatal blow like wild beasts they do not appear in all cases to compare numbers for each individual if attacked instead of retiring will endeavour to dash your brains out with a stone as certainly as a tiger under similar circumstances would tear you captain fitzroy on one occasion being very anxious from good reasons to frighten away a small party twice fired his pistol close by the side of a native the man both times looked astounded and carefully but quickly rubbed his head he then stared awhile and gabbled to his companions but he never seemed to think of running away we can hardly put ourselves in the position of these savages to understand their actions in the case of the fuegian the possibility of such a sound as the report of a gun close to his ear could never have entered his mind he perhaps literally did not for a second know whether it was a sound or a blow and therefore very naturally rubbed his head in a similar manner when a savage sees a mark struck by a bullet it may be some time before he is able at all to understand how it is effected for the fact of a body being invisible from its velocity would perhaps be to him an idea totally inconceivable moreover the extreme force of a bullet that penetrates a hard substance without tearing it may convince the savage that it has no force at all certainly i believe that many savages of the lowest grade such as these of tierra del fuego have seen objects struck and even small animals killed by the musket without being in the least aware how deadly an instrument it was dafter having passed an unmolested night in what would appear to be neutral territory between jemmys tribe and the people we saw yesterday we sailed pleasantly along the scenery in this part had a peculiar and very magnificent character although the effect was lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat and from looking down the valley and hence losing all the beauty of a succession of ridges the mountains attained an elevation of about feet and were terminated by sharp and jagged points they rose in one unbroken sweep from the waters edge and were covered to the height of fourteen or fifteen hundred feet by the duskycoloured forest it was most curious to observe how level and truly horizontal the line on the mountain side was as far as the eye could range at which trees ceased to grow it precisely resembled the highwater mark of drift weed on a seabeach at night we slept close to the junction of ponsonby sound with the beagle channel a small family of fuegians who were living in the cove were very quiet and inoffensive and soon joined our party round the blazing fire we were well clothed and though sitting close to the fire were far from too warm yet these naked savages though further off were observed to our great surprise to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting they seemed however very well pleased and all joined in the chorus of the seamens songs but the manner in which they were invariably a little behindhand was quite ludicrous during the night the news had spread and early in the morning d a fresh party arrived several of them had run so fast that their noses were bleeding and their mouths frothed from the rapidity with which they talked and with their naked bodies all bedaubed with black white and red they looked like so many demoniacs who had been fighting we then proceeded down ponsonby sound to the spot where poor jemmy expected to find his mother and relations we staid there five days captain fitzroy has given an account of all the interesting events which there happened during the succeeding year we paid another visit to the fuegians and the beagle herself followed the same course which i have just described as having been taken in the boats i was amused by finding what a difference the circumstance of being quite superior in force made in the interest of beholding these savages while in the boats i got to hate the very sound of their voices so much trouble did they give us the first and last word was yammerschooner when entering some quiet little cove we have looked round and thought to pass a quiet night the odious word yammerschooner has shrilly sounded from some gloomy nook and then the little signal smoke has curled upwards to spread the news on leaving some place we have said to each other thank heaven we have at last fairly left these wretches when one more faint halloo from an allpowerful voice heard at a prodigious distance would reach our ears and clearly could we distinguishyammerschooner but on the latter occasion the more fuegians the merrier and very merry work it was both parties laughing wondering gaping at each other we pitying them for giving us good fish and crabs for rags c they grasping at the chance of finding people so foolish as to exchange such splendid ornaments for a good supper it was most amusing to see the undisguised smile of satisfaction with which one young woman with her face painted black tied with rushes several bits of scarlet cloth round her head her husband who enjoyed the very universal privilege in this country of possessing two wives evidently became jealous of all the attention paid to his young wife and after a consultation with his naked beauties was paddled away by them some of the fuegians plainly showed that they had a fair idea of barter i gave one man a large nail a most valuable present without making any signs for a return but he immediately picked out two fish and handed them up on the point of his spear if any present was designed for one canoe and it fell near another it was invariably given to the right owner we were always much surprised at the little notice or rather none whatever which was evinced respecting many things even such as boats the use of which must have been evident simple circumstancessuch as the whiteness of our skins the beauty of scarlet cloth or blue beads the absence of women our care in washing ourselvesexcited their admiration far more than any grand or complicated object such as the ship bougainville has remarked concerning these very people that they treat the chef dœuvres de lindustrie humaine comme ils traitent les loix de la nature et ses phénomènes the perfect equality among the individuals composing these tribes must for a long time retard their civilization as we see those animals whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a chief are most capable of improvement so is it with the races of mankind whether we look at it as a cause or a consequence the more civilized always have the most artificial governments for instance the inhabitants of otaheite who when first discovered were governed by hereditary kings had arrived at a far higher grade than another branch of the same people the new zealanderswho although benefited by being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture were republicans in the most absolute sense in tierra del fuego until some chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired advantages such as the domesticated animals or other valuable presents it seems scarcely possible that the political state of the country can be improved at present even a piece of cloth is torn into shreds and distributed and no one individual becomes richer than another on the other hand it is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is property of some sort by which he might manifest and still increase his authority january thin the evening captain fitzroy sent two boats back to the ship from ponsonby sound and with the two others proceeded to survey the western end of the beagle channel the view in this central part was very remarkable looking towards either hand no object intercepted the vanishing points of this long canal of the mountains the circumstance of its being an arm of the sea was rendered very evident by several huge whales spouting in different directions on one occasion i saw two of these monsters probably male and female slowly swimming one after the other within less than a stones throw of the shore over which the beech extended its branches we sailed on till it was dark and then pitched our tents in a quiet creek the greatest luxury here is to find a beach of pebbles for they are both dry and yield to the body the peaty soil is damp rock is uneven and hard sand gets into ones meat when cooked and eaten boatfashion but when lying in our blanket bags on a good bed of smooth pebbles we passed most comfortable nights it was my watch till one oclock there is something very solemn in these scenes at no time does the consciousness in what a remote corner of the world you are then buried come so strongly before your mind every thing tends to this effect the stillness of the night is interrupted only by the heavy breathing of the seamen beneath the tents and sometimes by the cry of a night bird the occasional barking also of a dog heard in the distance reminds one that it is the land of the savage thearly in the morning we arrived at the point where the beagle channel divides itself into two arms and we entered the northern one the scenery here becomes even grander than before the lofty mountains on the north side compose the granitic axis or backbone of the whole country they were covered by a wide mantle of perpetual snow and numerous cascades poured their waters through the woods into the narrow channel below in many parts magnificent glaciers extended from the mountain side to the waters edge it is scarcely possible to imagine any thing more beautiful than the beryllike blue of the glacier and especially when contrasted with the dead white of an expanse of snow as fragments fell from the glacier into the water they floated away and the channel with its icebergs represented in miniature the polar sea when we reached the western mouth of this branch of the channel we sailed amongst many unknown islands and then proceeded by the outer coast to the entrance of the other arm thence we returned to ponsonby sound saw the fuegians and arrived at the ship after our twentydays excursion chapter xii falkland islands excursion round island aspect cattle horses rabbit wolflike fox fire made of bones art in making fire manner of hunting wild cattle geology fossil shells valleys filled with great fragments scenes of violence penguin geese eggs of doris zoophytes coralline phosphorescent compound animals falkland islands march th the beagle anchored in berkeley sound in east falkland island this archipelago is situated in nearly the same latitude as the mouth of the strait of magellan it covers a space of about by geographical miles and is a little more than half the size of ireland after the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by france spain and england they were left uninhabited the government of buenos ayres then sold them to a private individual but likewise used them as old spain had done before for a penal settlement england claimed her right and seized them the englishman who was left in charge of the flag was consequently murdered a british officer was next sent unsupported by any power and when we arrived we found him in charge of a population of which rather more than half were runaway rebels and murderers the theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it an undulating land with a desolate and wretched aspect is every where covered by a peaty soil and wiry grass of one monotonous brown colour here and there a peak or ridge of gray quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface every one has heard of the climate of these regions it may be compared to that which is experienced at the height of between one and two thousand feet on the mountains of north wales having however less sunshine and less frost but more wind and rain march thi will now describe a short excursion which i made round a part of this island in the morning i started with six horses and two gauchos the latter were capital men for the purpose and well accustomed to living on their own resources the weather was very boisterous and cold with heavy hailstorms we got on however pretty well but excepting in the geology nothing could be less interesting than our days ride the country is uniformly the same undulating moorland the surface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very small shrubs all springing out of an elastic peaty soil in the valleys here and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese and every where the ground was so soft that the snipe was able to feed besides these two kinds of birds there were few others there is one main range of hills nearly two thousand feet in height and composed of quartz rock the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to cross on the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle we met however no great number for they had lately been much harassed in the evening we came across a small herd one of my companions st jago by name soon separated a fat cow he threw the bolas and it struck her legs but failed in becoming entangled then dropping his hat to mark the spot where the balls were left while at full gallop he uncoiled his lazo and after a most severe chase again came up to the cow and caught her round the horns the other gaucho had gone on ahead with the horses so that st jago had some difficulty in killing the furious beast he managed to get her on a level piece of ground by taking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him and when she would not move my horse from having been trained would canter up and with his chest give her a violent push but when on level ground it does not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast mad with terror nor would it be so if the horse when left to itself without its rider did not soon learn for its own safety to keep the lazo tight so that if the animal moves forward the horse moves just as quickly so much away otherwise it stands motionless leaning on one side this horse however was a young one and would not stand still but gave in to the cow as she struggled it was admirable to see with what dexterity st jago dodged behind the beast till at last he contrived to give the fatal touch to the main tendon of the hind leg after which driving his knife into the head of the spinal marrow the cow dropped as if struck by lightning he cut off pieces of flesh with the skin to it but without any bones sufficient for our expedition we then rode on to our sleepingplace and had for supper carne con cuero or meat roasted with the skin on it this is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton a large circular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with the hide downwards and in the form of a saucer so that none of the gravy is lost if any worthy alderman had supped with us that evening carne con cuero without doubt would soon have been celebrated in london during the night it rained and the next day th was very stormy with much hail and snow we rode across the island to the neck of land which joins the rincon del toro the great peninsula at the sw extremity to the rest of the island from the greater number of cows which have been killed there is a large proportion of bulls these wander about by twos and threes or by themselves and are very savage i never saw such magnificent beasts they truly resembled the ancient sculptures in which the size of the neck and head is but seldom equalled among tame animals the young bulls ran away for a short distance but the old ones did not stir a step except to rush at man and horse and many of the latter have thus been killed one old bull crossed a boggy stream and took up his stand on the opposite side to us we in vain tried to drive him away and failing were obliged to make a large circuit the gauchos in revenge determined to render him for the future innocuous it was very interesting to see how art completely mastered force one lazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse and another round his hind legs in a minute the monster was stretched harmless on the ground after the lazo has once been tightly drawn round the horns of a furious animal it does not at first appear an easy thing to disengage it again nor i apprehend would it be so if the man was by himself and he did not wish to kill the beast by the aid however of a second person throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs it is quickly managed for the animal as long as its hind legs are kept outstretched is quite powerless and the first man can with his hands loosen his lazo and then quietly mount his horse but the moment the second man by backing ever so little relaxes the strain the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast which thus rises free shakes himself and vainly rushes after his antagonist during our whole ride we only saw one troop of wild horses these animals as well as the cattle were introduced by the french in since which time they have greatly increased it is a curious fact that the horses have never left the eastern end of the island although there is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming and that part of the island is not more tempting than the rest the gauchos though asserting this to be the case are unable to account for the circumstance the horses appear to thrive well yet they are small sized and have lost so much strength that they are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle with the lazo in consequence it is necessary to go to the great expense of importing fresh horses from the plata at some future period the southern hemisphere probably will have its breed of falkland ponies as the northern has that of shetland the rabbit is another animal which has been introduced and has succeeded very well so that they abound over large parts of the island yet like the horses they are confined within certain limits for they have not crossed the central chain of hills nor would they have extended even so far as the base if as the gauchos informed me small colonies had not been carried there i should not have supposed that these animals natives of northern africa could have existed in a climate so extremely humid as this and which enjoys so little sunshine that even wheat ripens only occasionally it is asserted that in sweden which any one would have thought a more favourable climate the rabbit cannot live out of doors the first few pair moreover had here to contend against preexisting enemies in the fox and some large hawks the french naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct species and called it lepus magellanicus they imagined that magellan when talking of an animal under the name of conejos in the strait of magellan referred to this species but he was alluding to a small cavy which to this day is thus called the gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the gray and they said that at all events it had not extended its range any further than the other that the two were never found separate and that they readily bred together and produced piebald offspring of the latter i now possess a specimen and it is marked about the head differently from the french specific description this circumstance shows how cautious naturalists should be in making species for even cuvier on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits thought it was probably distinct the only quadruped native to the island is a large wolflike fox which is common to both east and west falkland i have no doubt it is a peculiar species and confined to this archipelago because many sealers gauchos and indians who have visited these islands all maintain that no such animal is found in any part of south america molina from a similarity in habits thought this was the same with his culpeu but i have seen both and they are quite distinct these wolves are well known from byrons account of their tameness and curiosity which the sailors who ran into the water to avoid them mistook for fierceness to this day their manners remain the same they have been observed to enter a tent and actually pull some meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman the gauchos also have frequently killed them in the evening by holding out a piece of meat in one hand and in the other a knife ready to stick them as far as i am aware there is no other instance in any part of the world of so small a mass of broken land distant from a continent possessing so large a quadruped peculiar to itself their numbers have rapidly decreased they are already banished from that half of the island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between st salvador bay and berkeley sound within a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly settled in all probability this fox will be classed with the dodo as an animal which has perished from the face of the earth mr lowe an intelligent person who has long been acquainted with these islands assured me that all the foxes from the western island were smaller and of a redder colour than those from the eastern in the four specimens which were brought to england in the beagle there was some variation but the difference with respect to the islands could not be perceived at the same time the fact is far from improbable at night th we slept on the neck of land which forms the southwest peninsula the valley was pretty well sheltered from the cold wind but there was very little brushwood for fuel the gauchos however soon found what to my great surprise made nearly as hot a fire as coals this was the skeleton of a bullock lately killed from which the flesh had been picked by the caracaras they told me that in winter they had often killed a beast cleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives and then with these same bones roasted the meat for their suppers thit rained during nearly the whole day at night we managed however with our saddlecloths to keep ourselves pretty well dry and warm but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in the state of a bog and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after our days ride i have in another part stated how singular it is that trees should be entirely absent from these islands while they cover the whole surface of tierra del fuego the largest bush in the island belonging to the family of compositæ is scarcely so tall as our gorze the best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the size of common heath which has the useful property of burning while fresh and green it was very surprising to see the gauchos in the midst of rain and every thing soaking wet with nothing more than a tinderbox and piece of rag immediately make a fire they sought beneath the tufts of grass and bushes for a few dry twigs and these they rubbed into fibres then surrounding them with coarser twigs something like a birds nest they put the rag with its spark of fire in the middle and covered it up the nest being then held up to the wind by degrees it smoked more and more and at last burst out in flames i do not think any other method would have had a chance of succeeding with such damp materials theach morning from not having ridden for some time previously i was very stiff i was surprised to hear the gauchos who have from infancy almost lived on horseback say that under similar circumstances they always suffer st jago told me that having been confined for three months by illness he went out hunting wild cattle and in consequence for the next two days his thighs were so stiff that he was obliged to lie in bed this shows that the gauchos although they do not appear to do so yet really must exert much muscular effort in riding the hunting wild cattle in a country so difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground must be very hard work the gauchos say they often pass at full speed over ground which would be impassable at a slower pace in the same manner as a man is able to skate across thin ice when hunting the party endeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being discovered each man carries four or five pair of the bolas these he throws one after the other at as many cattle which when once entangled are left for some days till they become a little exhausted by hunger and struggling they are then let free and driven towards a small herd of tame animals which have been brought to the spot on purpose from their previous treatment being too much terrified to leave the herd they are easily driven if their strength lasts out to the settlement the weather continued so very bad that we determined to make a push and try to reach the vessel before night from the quantity of rain which had fallen the surface of the whole country was swampy i suppose my horse fell at least a dozen times and sometimes the whole six were floundering in the mud together all the little streams are bordered by soft peat which makes it very difficult for the horses to leap them without falling to complete our discomforts we were obliged to cross the head of a creek in which the water was as high as the backs of the horses and the little waves owing to the violence of the wind broke over us and made us very wet and cold even the ironframed gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the settlement after our little excursion the geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple the lower country consists of clayslate and sandstone associated together and the hills of white granular quartz rock the strata of the latter are frequently arched with perfect symmetry and the appearance of some of the masses is in consequence most singular pernety has devoted several pages to the description of a hill of ruins the successive strata of which he has justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre the quartz rock must have been quite pasty when it underwent such remarkable flexure without being shattered into fragments as a passage between the quartz and the sandstone can be traced it seems probable that the former owes its origin to the sandstone having been heated to such an excess that it became viscid and upon cooling crystallized while in the soft state it must have been pushed up through the overlying beds the sandstone and clayslate contain numerous casts of organic remains these chiefly consist of shells allied to terebratula of encrinites of a branching coral divided into alternate compartments and lastly of an obscure impression of the lobes of a trilobite these fossils possess great interest because none hitherto have been brought to europe from a latitude nearly so far south mr murchison who had the kindness to look at my specimens says that they have a close general resemblance to those belonging to the lower division of his silurian system and mr james sowerby is of opinion that some of the species are identical this would be a most remarkable circumstance in the ancient natural history of the world for shells now living in latitude on opposite sides of the equator are totally distinct from the similarity of the falkland fossils with those in england which are associated with remains that indicate a climate of a tropical character we may i presume infer that during this same epoch nearly the whole world was thus circumstanced in many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in an extraordinary manner by myriads of great angular fragments of the quartz rock these have been mentioned with surprise by every voyager since the time of pernety the whole may be called a stream of stones the blocks vary in size from that of a mans chest to ten or twenty times as large and occasionally they altogether exceed such measures their edges show no signs of being waterworn but are only a little blunted they do not occur thrown together in irregular piles but are spread out into level sheets or great streams it is not possible to ascertain their thickness but the water of small streamlets could be heard trickling through the stones many feet below the surface the actual depth is probably much greater because the crevices between the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with sand and the bed of the rivulet thus raised the width of these beds varies from a few hundred feet to a mile but the peaty soil daily encroaches on the borders and even forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close together in a valley south of berkeley sound which some of our party called the great valley of fragments it was necessary to cross an uninterrupted band half a mile wide by jumping from one pointed stone to another so large were the fragments that being overtaken by a shower of rain i readily found good shelter beneath one of them their little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these streams of stones on the hillsides i have seen them sloping at an angle of ten degrees with the horizon but in some of the level broadbottomed valleys the inclination is only just sufficient to be clearly perceived on so rugged a surface there was no means of measuring the angle but to give a common illustration i may say that the slope alone would not have checked the speed of an english mailcoach in some places a continuous stream of these fragments followed up the course of a valley and even extended to the very crest of the hill on these crests huge masses exceeding in dimensions any small building seemed to stand arrested in their headlong course there also the curved strata of the archways lay piled over each other like the ruins of some vast and ancient cathedral in endeavouring to describe these scenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one simile to another we may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed from many parts of the mountains into the lower country and that when consolidated they had been rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads of fragments the expression streams of stones which immediately occurred to every one conveyed the same idea these scenes are on the spot rendered more striking by the contrast of the low rounded forms of the neighbouring hills i was much interested by finding on the highest peak of one range about feet above the sea a great arched fragment lying on its convex or upper surface must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in the air and thus turned or with more probability that there existed formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point on which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies as the fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices filled up with sand we must infer that the period of violence was subsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea in a transverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly level or rises but very little towards either side hence the fragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley but in reality it seems most probable either that they have been hurled down from the nearest slopes or that masses of rock were broken up in the position they formerly occupied and that since by a vibratory movement of overwhelming force the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet if during the earthquake which in overthrew concepcion in chile it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been pitched a few inches from the ground what must we say to a movement which has caused fragments many tons in weight like so much sand on a vibrating board to move onwards and find their level i have seen in the cordillera of the andes the evident marks where stupendous mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust and the strata thrown on their vertical edges but never did any scene like the streams of stones so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a convulsion of which in historical records we might in vain seek for any counterpart i have little to remark on the zoology of these islands i have before described the polyborus or caracara there are some other hawks owls and a few small landbirds the waterfowl are particularly numerous and they must formerly from the accounts of old navigators have been much more so one day having placed myself between a penguin aptenodytes demersa and the water i was much amused by watching its habits it was a brave bird and till reaching the sea it regularly fought and drove me backwards nothing less than heavy blows would have stopped him every inch gained he firmly kept standing close before me erect and determined when thus opposed he continually rolled his head from side to side in a very odd manner as if the power of distinct vision only lay in the anterior and basal part of each eye this bird is commonly called the jackass penguin from its habit while on shore of throwing its head backwards and making a loud strange noise very like the braying of that animal but while at sea and undisturbed its note is very deep and solemn and is often heard in the nighttime in diving its little plumeless wings are used as fins but on the land as front legs when crawling it may be said on four legs through the tussocks or on the side of a grassy cliff it moved so very quickly that it might readily have been mistaken for a quadruped when at sea and fishing it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with such a spring and dives again so instantaneously that i defy any one at first sight to be sure that it is not a fish leaping for sport two kinds of geese frequent the falklands the upland species anas leucoptera is common in pairs and in small flocks throughout the island they do not migrate but build on the small outlying islets this is supposed to be from fear of the foxes and it is perhaps from the same cause that these birds though very tame by day are shy and wild in the dusk of the evening they live entirely on vegetable matter the rockgoose so called from living exclusively on the seabeach anas antarctica is common both here and on the west coast of america as far north as chile in the deep and retired channels of tierra del fuego the snowwhite gander invariably accompanied by his darker consort and standing close by each other on some distant rocky point is a common feature in the landscape in these islands a great loggerheaded duck or goose anas brachyptera which sometimes weighs twentytwo pounds is very abundant these birds were in former days called from their extraordinary manner of paddling and splashing upon the water racehorses but now they are named much more appropriately steamers their wings are too small and weak to allow of flight but by their aid partly swimming and partly flapping the surface of the water they move very quickly the manner is something like that by which the common houseduck escapes when pursued by a dog but i am nearly sure that the steamer moves its wings alternately instead of both together as in other birds these clumsy loggerheaded ducks make such a noise and splashing that the effect is exceedingly curious thus we find in south america three birds which use their wings for other purposes besides flight the penguin as fins the steamer as paddles and the ostrich as sails to a vessel the steamer is able to dive only a very short distance it feeds entirely on shellfish from the kelp and tidal rocks hence the beak and head for the purpose of breaking them are surprisingly heavy and strong so strong is the head that i have scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological hammer and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds were of life when pluming themselves in the evening in a flock they make the same odd mixture of sounds which bullfrogs do within the tropics in tierra del fuego as well as at the falkland islands i made many observations on the lower marine animals but they are of little general interest i will only mention one class of facts relating to certain zoophytes in the more highly organized division of that class several genera flustra eschara cellaria crisia and others agree in having singular moveable organs like those of flustra avicularia found in the european seas attached to their cells the organ in the greater number of cases very closely resembles the head of a vulture but the lower mandible can be opened much wider so as to form even a straight line with the upper the head itself possesses considerable powers of movement by means of a short neck in one zoophyte the head itself was fixed but the lower jaw free in another it was replaced by a triangular hood with a beautifullyfitted trapdoor which evidently answered to the lower mandible a species of stony eschara had a structure somewhat similar in the greater number of species each shell was provided with one head but in others each had two the young cells at the end of the branches necessarily contained quite immature polypi yet the vultureheads attached to them though small were in every respect perfect when the polypus was removed by a needle from any of the cells these organs did not appear in the least affected when one of the latter was cut off from a cell the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing perhaps the most singular part of their structure is that when there were more rows of cells than two both in a flustra and an eschara the central cells were furnished with these appendages of only onefourth the size of the lateral ones their movements varied according to the species in some i never saw the least motion while others with the lower mandible generally wide open oscillated backwards and forwards at the rate of about five seconds each turn others moved rapidly and by starts when touched with a needle the beak generally seized the point so firmly that the whole branch might be shaken these bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the gemmules i could not trace any connexion between them and the polypus from their formation being completed before that of the latter from the independence of their movements from the difference of their size in different parts of the branch i have little doubt that in their functions they are related rather to the axis than to any of the polypi in a similar manner the fleshy appendage at the extremity of the seapen forms part of the zoophyte as a whole as much as the roots of a tree do of the whole and not of the individual buds without doubt this is a very curious variation in the structure of a zoophyte for the growing part in most other cases does not manifest the least irritability or power of movement i will mention one other kind of structure quite as anomalous a small and elegant crisia is furnished at the corner of each cell with a long and slightlycurved bristle which is fixed at the lower end by a joint it terminates in the finest point and has its outer or convex side serrated with delicate teeth or notches having placed a small piece of a branch under the microscope i was exceedingly surprised to see it suddenly start from the field of vision by the movement of these bristles which acted as oars irritation generally produced this motion but not always when the coralline was laid flat on that side from which the toothed bristles projected they were necessarily all pressed together and entangled this scarcely ever failed to excite a considerable movement among them and evidently with the object of freeing themselves in a small piece which was taken out of water and placed on blottingpaper the movement of these organs was clearly visible for a few seconds by the naked eye in the case of the vultureheads as well as in that of the bristles all that were on one side of a branch moved sometimes coinstantaneously sometimes in regular order one after the other at other times the organs on both sides the branch moved together but generally all were independent of each other and entirely so of the polypi in the crisia if the bristles were excited to move by irritation in any one branch generally the whole zoophyte was affected in the instance where the branch started from the simultaneous movement of these appendages we see as perfect a transmission of will as in a single animal the case indeed is not different from that of the seapen which when touched drew itself into the sand i will state one other instance of uniform action though of a very different nature in a zoophyte closely allied to clytia and therefore very simply organized having kept a large tuft of it in a basin of salt water when it was dark i found that as often as i rubbed any part of a branch the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a green light i do not think i ever saw any object more beautifully so but the remarkable circumstance was that the flashes of light always proceeded up the branches from the base towards the extremities the examination of these compound animals was always very interesting to me what can be more remarkable than to see a plantlike body producing an egg furnished with setæ and having independent movements which soon becomes fixed branches into numberless arms and these though crowded with polypi yet in some cases possessing independent organs of movement and obeying uniform impulses of will the polypi are frequently animals of no simple organization and in most respects certainly are to be considered as true individuals it is therefore more curious to observe in the young and terminal cells their gradual formation from the growth of the simple horny substance of which so many zoophytes are composed the known organization of a tree should remove all surprise at the union of many individuals together and their relation to a common body indeed we might expect according to the apparent law that any structure which prevails in one class will be produced in a lesser degree in some othersthat since so many plants are compound so would some animals be thus constructed it requires however a greater effort of reason to view a bud as an individual than a polypus furnished with a mouth and intestines and therefore the union does not appear so strange our conception of a compound animal where in some respects the individuality of each is not completed may be aided by reflecting on the production of two distinct creatures by bisecting one with a knife or where nature herself performs the task we may consider the polypi in a zoophyte or the buds in a tree as cases where the division of the individual has not been completely effected in this kind of generation the individuals seem produced only with relation to the present time their numbers are multiplied but their life is not extended beyond a fixed period by the other and more artificial kind through intermediate steps or ovules the relation is kept up through successive ages by the latter method many peculiarities which are transmitted by the former are obliterated and the character of the species is limited while on the other hand certain peculiarities doubtless adaptations become hereditary and form races we may fancy that in these two circumstances we see a step towards the final cause of the shortness of life with regard to associated life animals of other classes besides the mollusca and radiata present obscure instances of it the bee could not live by itself and in the neuter we see an individual produced which is not fitted for the reproduction of its kindthat highest point at which the organization of all animals especially the lower ones tendstherefore such neuters are born as much for the good of

end of may we entered for the second time the eastern mouth of the strait of magellan having beat our way against wind and wave we anchored at gregory bay and had an interview with the socalled gigantic patagonians of whom captain fitzroy has given so good an account the country on both sides of the strait in this part consists of level plains like those of the rest of patagonia cape negro a little past the second narrow may be considered as the point where the land begins to assume the marked features of tierra del fuego on the east coast south of the strait broken parklike scenery in a like manner connects these two countries which are opposed to each other in almost every point it is truly surprising to find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape if we take rather a greater distance as between port famine and gregory bay that is about sixty miles the difference is still more wonderful at the former place we have rounded mountains concealed by impervious forests which are drenched with the rain brought by an endless succession of gales while at cape gregory there is a clear and bright blue sky over the dry and sterile plains the atmospheric currents although rapid turbulent and unconfined by any apparent limits yet seem to follow like a river in its bed a regularly determined course june stwe anchored in the fine bay of port famine it was now the beginning of winter and i never saw a more cheerless prospect the dusky woods piebald with snow could be only indistinctly seen through a drizzling hazy atmosphere we were however lucky in getting two fine days on one of these mount sarmiento a distant mountain feet high presented a very noble spectacle i was frequently surprised in the scenery of tierra del fuego at the little apparent elevation of mountains really lofty i suspect it is owing to a cause which would not at first be imagined namely that the whole mass from the summit to the waters edge is generally in full view i remember having seen a mountain first from the beagle channel where the whole sweep from the summit to the base was full in view and then from ponsonby sound across several successive ridges and it was curious to observe in the latter case as each fresh step afforded means of judging of the distance how the mountain appeared to rise in height the fuegians twice came and plagued us as there were many instruments clothes and men on shore it was thought necessary to frighten them away the first time a few great guns were fired when they were far distant it was most ludicrous to watch through a glass the indians as often as the shot struck the water take up stones and as a bold defiance throw them towards the ship though about a mile and a half distant a boat was then sent with orders to fire a few musketshot wide of them the fuegians hid themselves behind the trees and for every discharge of the musket they fired their arrows all however fell short of the boat and the officer as he pointed at them laughed this made the fuegians frantic with passion and they shook their mantles in vain rage at last seeing the balls cut and strike the trees they ran away and we were left in peace and quietness on a former occasion when the beagle was here in the month of february i started one morning at four oclock to ascend mount tarn which is feet high and is the most elevated point in this immediate neighbourhood we went in a boat to the foot of the mountain but not to the best part and then began our ascent the forest commences at the line of highwater mark and during the two first hours i gave over all hopes of reaching the summit so thick was the wood that it was necessary to have constant recourse to the compass for every landmark though in a mountainous country was completely shut out in the deep ravines the deathlike scene of desolation exceeded all description outside it was blowing a gale but in these hollows not even a breath of wind stirred the leaves of the tallest trees so gloomy cold and wet was every part that not even the fungi mosses or ferns could flourish in the valleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along they were so completely barricaded by the great mouldering trunks which had fallen down in every direction when passing over these natural bridges ones course was often arrested by sinking knee deep into the rotten wood at other times when attempting to lean against a firm tree one was startled by finding a mass of decayed matter ready to fall at the slightest touch we at last found ourselves among the stunted trees and then soon reached the bare ridge which conducted us to the summit here was a view characteristic of tierra del fuegoirregular chains of hills mottled with patches of snow deep yellowishgreen valleys and arms of the sea intersecting the land in many directions the strong wind was piercingly cold and the atmosphere rather hazy so that we did not stay long on the top of the mountain our descent was not quite so laborious as our ascent
