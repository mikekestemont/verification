posterior and well does the shameless little bird deserve its name for it carries its tail more than erect that is inclined backwards towards its head it is very common and frequents the bottoms of hedgerows and the bushes scattered over the barren hills where scarcely another bird can exist hence the tapacolo is conspicuous in the ornithology of chile in its general manner of feeding of quickly hopping out of the thickets and back again in its desire of concealment unwillingness to take flight and nidification it bears a close resemblance to the turco but its appearance is not quite so ridiculous the tapacolo is very crafty when frightened by any person it will remain motionless at the bottom of a bush and will then after a little while try with much address to crawl away on the opposite side it is also an active bird and continually making a noise these noises are various and strangely odd some are like the cooing of doves others like the bubbling of water and many defy all similes the country people say it changes its cry five times in the yearaccording to some change of season i suppose i believe these two species of pteroptochos are only found in central chile to the southward within the damp forest region two other species supply the place of these lovers of a more sterile land and a fifth species is common to both districts on the patagonian coast a bird allied to them both in structure and habits represents this chilian genus two species of hummingbirds are common and i have seen a third kind within the cordillera at an elevation of about feet mellisuga kingii is found over a space of miles on the west coast from the hot dry country of lima to the forests of tierra del fuegowhere it has been described as flitting about in a snowstorm in the wooded island of chiloe which has an extremely humid climate this little bird skipping from side to side amidst the dripping foliage is perhaps more abundant than almost any other kind it there very commonly frequents open marshy ground where a kind of bromelia grows hovering near the edge of the thick beds it every now and then dashed in close to the ground but i could not see whether it ever actually alighted at the time of year i refer to there were very few flowers and none whatever near the beds of bromelia hence i was quite sure they did not live on honey and on opening the stomach and upper intestine by the aid of a lens i could plainly distinguish in a yellow fluid morsels of the wings of dipteraprobably tipulidæ it is evident that these birds search for minute insects in their winterquarters under the thick foliage i opened the stomachs of several specimens which were shot in different parts of the continent and in all remains of insects were so numerous as often to present a black comminuted mass as in the stomach of a creeper in central chile these birds are migratory they make their appearance there in autumn and in the latter end of the month corresponding to our october they were very common in the spring they began to disappear and on the th of what would correspond to our march in the course of a long walk i saw only one individual as this species migrates to the southward it is replaced by the arrival of a larger kind which will be presently described i do not believe the small kind breeds in chile for during the summer their nests were common to the south of that country the migration of the hummingbirds on both the east and west coast of north america exactly corresponds to what takes place in this southern continent in both cases they move towards the tropic during the colder parts of the year and retreat northward before the returning heat some however remain during the whole year in tierra del fuego and in northern californiawhich in the northern hemisphere has the same relative position which tierra del fuego has in the southernsome according to beechey likewise remain the second species trochilus gigas is a very large bird for the delicate family to which it belongs in the neighbourhood of valparaiso during this year it had arrived in numbers a little before the vernal equinox it comes from the parched deserts of the north probably for the purpose of breeding in chile when on the wing the appearance of this bird is singular like others of the genus it moves from place to place with a rapidity which may be compared to that of syrphus amongst diptera and sphinx among moths but whilst hovering over a flower it flaps its wings with a very slow and powerful movement totally different from that vibratory one common to most of the species which produces the humming noise i never saw any other bird where the force of its wings appeared as in a butterfly so powerful in proportion to the weight of its body when hovering by a flower its tail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan the body being kept in a nearly vertical position this action appears to steady and support the bird between the slow movements of its wings although flying from flower to flower in search of food its stomach generally contained abundant remains of insects which i suspect are much more the object of its search than honey is the note of this species like that of nearly the whole family is extremely shrill chapter xv chiloe general aspect boat excursion native indians castro large leaves of gunnera scabra tame fox ascend

of ornithology petrels chiloe and chonos islands november ththe beagle sailed from valparaiso to the southward for the purpose of surveying the southern part of chile the island of chiloe and the broken land called the chonos archipelago as far south as the peninsula of tres montes on the st we anchored in the bay of s carlos the capital of chiloe this island is about ninety miles long with a breadth of rather less than thirty the land is hilly but not mountainous and is every where covered by one great forest excepting a few scattered green patches which have been cleared round the thatched cottages from a distance the view somewhat resembles tierra del fuego but the woods when seen nearer are incomparably more beautiful many kinds of fine evergreen trees and plants with a tropical character here take the place of the gloomy beech of the southern shores in winter the climate is detestable and in summer it is only a little better i should think there are few parts of the world within the temperate regions where so much rain falls the winds are very boisterous and the sky almost always clouded to have a week of fine weather is something wonderful it is even difficult to get a single glimpse of the cordillera during our first visit only one opportunity occurred and that was before sunrise when the volcano of osorno stood out in bold relief and it was curious to watch as the sun rose the outline gradually fading away in the glare of the eastern sky the inhabitants from their complexion and low stature appear to have threefourths of indian blood in their veins they are an humble quiet industrious set of men although the fertile soil resulting from the decomposition of volcanic rocks supports a rank vegetation yet the climate is not favourable to any production which requires much sunshine to ripen it there is very little pasture for the larger quadrupeds and in consequence the staple articles of food are pigs potatoes and fish the people all dress in strong woollen garments which each family makes for itself and dyes with indigo of a dark blue colour the arts however are in the rudest stateas may be seen in their strange fashion of ploughing their method of spinning grinding corn and in the construction of their boats the forests are so impenetrable that the land is nowhere cultivated except near the coast and on the adjoining islets even where roads exist they are scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil the inhabitants like those of tierra del fuego chiefly move about on the beach or in boats in some cases the latter afford the only means of getting from one house to another although with plenty to eat the people are very poor there is no demand for labour and consequently the lower orders cannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the smallest luxuries there is also a great deficiency of a circulating medium i have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal with which to buy some trifle and another a plank to exchange for a bottle of wine hence every tradesman must also be a merchant and again sell the goods which he takes in exchange november ththe yawl and whaleboat were sent under the command of mr sulivan to survey the eastern or inland coast of chiloe and with orders to meet the beagle at the southern extremity of the island to which point she would proceed by the outside so as thus to circumnavigate the island i accompanied this expedition but instead of going in the boats the first day i hired horses to take me to chacao at the northern extremity of the island the road followed the coast every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine forests in these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the whole road should be made of logs of wood which are squared and placed by the side of each other from the rays of the sun never penetrating the evergreen foliage the ground is so damp and soft that except by such means neither man nor horse would be able to pass along i arrived at the village of chacao shortly after the tents belonging to the boats had been pitched for the night the land in this neighbourhood had been extensively cleared and there were many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest chacao was formerly the principal port but many vessels having been lost owing to the dangerous currents and rocks in the straits the spanish government burnt the church and thus arbitrarily compelled the greater number of inhabitants to migrate to s carlos in a short time the barefooted son of the governor came down to reconnoitre us seeing the english flag hoisted at the yawls masthead he asked with the utmost indifference whether it was always to fly at chacao in several places the inhabitants were much astonished at the appearance of menofwars boats and hoped and believed it was the forerunner of a spanish fleet coming to recover the island from the patriot government of chile all the men in power had however been informed of our intended visit and were exceedingly civil while we were eating our supper the governor paid us a visit he had been a lieutenantcolonel in the spanish service but now was miserably poor he gave us two sheep and accepted in return two cotton handkerchiefs some brass trinkets and a little tobacco thtorrents of rain we managed however to run down the coast as far as huapilenou the whole of this eastern side of chiloe has one aspect it is a plain broken by valleys and divided into little islands and the whole thickly covered with one impervious blackishgreen forest on the margins there are some cleared spaces surrounding the highroofed cottages ththe day rose splendidly clear the volcano of osorno was spouting out volumes of smoke this most beautiful mountain formed like a perfect cone and white with snow stands out in front of the cordillera another great volcano with a saddleshaped summit also emitted from its immense crater little jets of steam subsequently we saw the loftypeaked corcovadowell deserving the name of el famoso corcovado thus we beheld from one point of view three great active volcanoes each of which had an elevation of about seven thousand feet in addition to this far to the south there were other very lofty cones covered with snow which although not known to be active must have been in their origin volcanic the line of the andes is not in this neighbourhood nearly so elevated as in chile neither does it appear to form so perfect a barrier between the regions of the earth this great range although running in a direct north and south line owing to an optical deception always appeared more or less semicircular for the extreme peaks being seen standing above the same horizon together with the nearer ones their much greater distance was not so easily recognised when landing on a point to take observations we saw a family of pure indian extraction the father was singularly like york minster and some of the younger boys with their ruddy complexions might have been mistaken for pampas indians every thing i have seen convinces me of the close connexion of the different tribes who nevertheless speak quite distinct languages this party could muster but little spanish and talked to each other in their own tongue it is a pleasant thing to see the aborigines advanced to the same degree of civilization however low that may be which their white conquerors have attained more to the south we saw many pure indians indeed some of the islands such as chauques c have no other inhabitants than such as retain the indian surname in the census of there were in chiloe and its dependencies fortytwo thousand souls the greater number of these appear to be little coppercoloured men of mixed blood eleven thousand actually retain their indian surname but it is probable that not nearly all of them are of pure blood their manner of life is the same with that of the other poor inhabitants and they are all christians but it is said that they yet retain some strange superstitious ceremonies and that they pretend to hold communication with the devil in certain caves formerly every one convicted of this offence was sent to the inquisition at lima many of those people who are not included in the eleven thousand cannot be distinguished by their appearance from indians gomez the governor of lemuy is descended from noblemen of spain on both sides but by constant intermarriages with natives the present man is an indian on the other hand the governor of quinchao boasts much of his pure spanish blood we reached at night a beautiful little cove north of the island of caucahue the people here complained of want of land this is partly owing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods and partly to restrictions of the government which makes it necessary before buying ever so small a piece to pay two shillings to the surveyor for measuring each quadra yards square together with whatever price he fixes for the value of the land after his valuation the land must be put up three times to auction and if no one bids more the purchaser can have it at that rate all these exactions must be a serious check to clearing the ground where the inhabitants are so extremely poor in most countries forests are removed without much difficulty by the aid of fire but in chiloe from the damp nature of the climate and the sort of trees it is necessary first to cut them down this is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of chiloe in the time of the spaniards the indians could not hold land and a family after having cleared a piece of ground might be driven away and the property seized by the government the chilian authorities are now performing an act of justice by making retribution to these poor indians giving to each man according to his grade of life a certain portion of land the value of uncleared ground is very little the government gave mr douglas the present surveyor who informed me of these circumstances eight and a half square miles of forest near s carlos in lieu of a debt and this he sold for dollars or about seventy pounds sterling the two succeeding days were fine and at night we reached the island of quinchao this neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the archipelago for a broad strip of land on the coast of the main island as well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones is almost completely cleared some of the farmhouses seemed very comfortable i was curious to ascertain how rich any of these people might be but mr douglas says that no one can be considered as possessing a regular income one of the richest landowners might possibly accumulate in a long industrious life as much as a thousand pounds sterling but should this happen it would all be stowed away in some secret corner for it is the custom of almost every family to have a jar or treasurechest buried in the ground november thearly on sunday morning we reached castrothe ancient capital of chiloe but now a most forlorn and deserted place the usual quadrangular arrangement of spanish towns could be traced but the streets and plaza were coated with fine green turf on which sheep were browsing the church which stands in the middle is entirely built of plank and has a picturesque and venerable appearance the poverty of the place may be conceived from the fact that although containing some hundreds of inhabitants one of our party was unable any where to purchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife no individual possessed either a watch or a clock and an old man who was supposed to have a good idea of time was employed to strike the church bell by guess the arrival of our boats was a rare event in this quiet retired corner of the world and nearly all the inhabitants came down to the beach to see us pitch our tents they were very civil and offered us a house and one man even sent us a cask of cider as a present in the afternoon we paid our respects to the governora quiet old man who in his appearance and manner of life was scarcely superior to an english cottager at night heavy rain set in which was hardly sufficient to drive away from the tents the large circle of lookers on an indian family who had come to trade in a canoe from caylen bivouacked near us they had no shelter during the rain in the morning i asked a young indian who was wet to the skin how he had passed the night he seemed perfectly content and answered muy bien senor december stwe steered for the island of lemuy i was anxious to examine a reported coalmine which turned out to be lignite of little value in the sandstone probably of an ancient tertiary epoch of which these islands are composed when we reached lemuy we had much difficulty in finding any place to pitch our tents for it was spring tide and the land was wooded down to the waters edge in a short time we were surrounded by a large group of the nearly pure indian inhabitants they were much surprised at our arrival and said one to the other this is the reason we have seen so many parrots lately the cheucau an odd redbreasted little bird which inhabits the thick forest and utters very peculiar noises has not cried beware for nothing they were soon anxious for barter money was scarcely worth any thing but their eagerness for tobacco was something quite extraordinary after tobacco indigo came next in value then capsicum old clothes and gunpowder the latter article was required for a very innocent purpose each parish has a public musket and the gunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their saint or feast days the people here live chiefly on shellfish and potatoes at certain seasons they catch also in corrales or hedges under water many fish which are left on the mudbanks as the tide falls they occasionally possess fowls sheep goats pigs horses and cattle the order in which they are here mentioned expressing their respective frequency i never saw any thing more obliging and humble than the manners of these people they generally began with stating that they were poor natives of the place and not spaniards and that they were in sad want of tobacco and other comforts at caylen the most southern island we bought with a stick of tobacco of the value of threehalfpence two fowlsone of which the indian stated had skin between its toes and turned out to be a fine duck and with some cotton handkerchiefs worth three shillings we procured three sheep and a large bunch of onions the yawl at this place was anchored some way from the shore and we had fears for her safety during the night our pilot mr douglas accordingly told the constable of the district that we always placed sentinels with loaded arms and not understanding spanish if we saw any person in the dark we should assuredly shoot him the constable with much humility agreed to the perfect propriety of this arrangement and promised us that no one should stir out of his house during that night during the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward the general features of the country remained the same but it was much less thickly inhabited on the large island of tanqui there was scarcely one cleared spot the trees on every side extending their branches over the seabeach i one day noticed some very fine plants of the panke gunnera scabra which somewhat resembles the rhubarb on a gigantic scale growing on the sandstone cliffs the inhabitants eat the stalks which are subacid and tan leather with the roots and prepare a black die from them the leaf is nearly circular but deeply indented on its margin i measured one which had a diameter of nearly eight feet and therefore a circumference of no less than twentyfour the stalk is rather more than a yard high and each plant sends out four or five of these enormous leavespresenting together a very noble appearance december thwe reached caylen called el fin del cristiandad in the morning we stopped for a few minutes at a house on the northern end of laylec which was the extreme point of south american christendom and a miserable hovel it was the latitude is which is two degrees further south than the rio negro on the atlantic coast these extreme christians were very poor and under the plea of their situation begged some tobacco as a proof of the poverty of these indians i may mention that shortly before this we had met a man who had travelled three days and a half on foot and had as many to return for the sake of recovering the value of a small axe and a few fish how very difficult it must be to buy the smallest article when such trouble is taken to recover so small a debt in the evening we reached the island of s pedro where we found the beagle at anchor in doubling the point two of the officers landed to take a round of angles with the theodolite a fox of a kind said to be peculiar to the island and very rare in it and which is an undescribed species was sitting on the rocks he was so intently absorbed in watching their manœuvres that i was able by quietly walking up behind to knock him on the head with my geological hammer this fox more curious or more scientific but less wise than the generality of his brethren is now mounted in the museum of the zoological society we staid three days in this harbour on one of which captain fitzroy with a party attempted to ascend to the summit of san pedro the woods here had rather a different aspect from those on the northern parts of the island the rock also being micaceous slate there was no beach but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water the general aspect in consequence was more like that of tierra del fuego than of chiloe in vain we tried to gain the summit he forest was so impenetrable that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so entangled a mass of dying and dead trunks i am sure that often for more than ten minutes together our feet never touched the ground and we were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it so that the seamen as a joke called out the soundings at other times we crept one after another on our hands and knees under the rotten trunks in the lower part of the mountain noble trees of the winters bark and a laurel like the sassafras with fragrant leaves and others the names of which i do not know were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane here we were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal on the higher parts brushwood takes the place of larger trees with here and there a red cedar or an alerce pine i was also pleased to see at an elevation of a little less than feet our old friend the southern beech they were however poor stunted trees and i should think this must be nearly their northern limit we ultimately gave up the attempt in despair december ththe yawl and whaleboat with mr sulivan proceeded on their survey but i remained on board the beagle which the next day left s pedro for the southward on the th we ran into an opening in the southern part of guayatecas or the chonos archipelago and it was fortunate we did so for on the following day a storm worthy of tierra del fuego raged with its wonted fury white massive clouds were piled up against a dark blue sky and across them black ragged sheets of vapour were rapidly driven the successive mountainranges appeared like dim shadows and the setting sun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam much like that produced by the flame of spirits of wine on a mans countenance the water was white with the flying spray and the wind lulled and roared again through the rigging it was a most ominous sublime scene during a few minutes there was a bright rainbow and it was curious to observe the effect of the spray which being carried along the surface of the water changed the ordinary semicircle into a ring a band of prismatic colours was continued from both feet of the common arch across the bay close to the vessels side thus forming a distorted but very nearly entire circle we staid here three days the weather continued bad but this did not much signify for the surface of the land in all these islands is all but impassable the coast is so very rugged that to attempt to walk in that direction requires continued scrambling up and down over the sharp rocks of mica slate and as for the woodsour faces hands and shinbones all bore witness to the maltreatment we received in merely attempting to penetrate their forbidden recesses december thwe stood out to sea on the th we bade farewell to the south and with a fair wind turned the ships head northward from cape tres montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weatherbeaten coast which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills and the thick covering of foresteven on the almost precipitous flanks the next day a harbour was discovered which on this dangerous coast might be of great utility to a distressed vessel it can easily be recognised by a hill feet high which is even more perfectly conical than the famous sugarloaf at rio de janeiro the next day after anchoring i succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill it was a laborious undertaking for the sides were so steep that in some parts it was necessary to use the trees as ladders there were also several extensive brakes of the fuchsia covered with its beautiful drooping flowers but very difficult to crawl through in these wild countries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain there is an indefinite expectation of meeting something very strange which however often it may be balked never failed with me to recur on each successive attempt every one must know the feeling of triumph and pride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind in these little frequented countries there is also joined to it some vanity that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this pinnacle or admired this view a strong desire is always felt to ascertain whether any body has previously visited the place a bit of wood with a nail in it is picked up and studied as if it were covered with hieroglyphics possessed with this feeling i was much interested by finding on a wild part of the coast a bed made of grass beneath a ledge of rock close by it there had been a fire and the man had used an axe the fire bed and situation showed the dexterity of an indian but he could scarcely have been an indian for the race is in this part extinct owing to the catholic desire of making at one blow christians and slaves i had at the time some misgivings though they afterwards were proved to have been groundless that the solitary man who had made his bed on this wild spot must have been some poor shipwrecked sailor who in trying to travel up the coast had here lain himself down for his dreary night december ththe weather continued very bad but it at last permitted us to proceed with the survey the time hung heavy on our hands as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by successive gales of wind in the evening another harbour was discovered where we anchored directly afterwards a man was seen waving his shirt and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen a party of six had run away from an american whaling vessel and had landed a little to the southward in a boat which was shortly afterwards knocked to pieces by the surf they had now been wandering up and down the coast for fifteen months without knowing which way to go or where they were what a singular piece of good fortune it was that this harbour was now discovered had it not been for this one chance they might have wandered till they had grown old men and at last have perished on this wild coast their sufferings had been very great and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the cliffs they were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food and this explained the bed of the solitary man considering what they had undergone i think they had kept a very good reckoning of time though they had lost four days by making this the th instead of the th december thwe anchored in a snug little cove at the foot of some high hills near the northern extremity of tres montes after breakfast the next morning a party ascended one of these mountains which had an altitude of feet the scenery was remarkable the chief part of the range was composed of grand solid abrupt masses of granite which appeared as if they had been coeval with the beginning of the world the granite is capped with slaty gneiss and this in the lapse of ages has been worn into strange fingershaped points these two formations thus differing in their outlines agree in being almost destitute of vegetation this barrenness had to our eyes a still stranger appearance from our having been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal forest of dark green trees i took much delight in examining the structure of these mountains the complicated and lofty ranges bore a noble aspect of durabilityequally profitless however to man and to all other animals granite to the geologist is classic ground from its widespread limits and its beautiful and compact texture few rocks have been more early recognised granite has given rise perhaps to more discussion concerning its origin than any other formation we generally see it constituting the fundamental rock and however formed we know it is the deepest layer in the crust of this globe to which man has been able to penetrate the limit of mans knowledge in any subject possesses a high interest which is perhaps increased by its close neighbourhood to the realms of imagination january st the new year is ushered in with the ceremonies proper to it in these regions she lays out no false hopes a heavy n w gale with steady rain bespeaks the rising year thank god we are not destined here to see the end of it but hope then to be in the pacific where a blue sky tells one there is a heavena something beyond the clouds above our heads the n w winds prevailing for the next four days we only managed to cross a great bay and then anchored in another secure harbour i accompanied the captain in a boat to the head of a deep creek on the way the number of seals which we saw was quite astonishing every bit of flat rock and parts of the beach were covered with them they appeared to be of a loving disposition and lay huddled together fast asleep like so many pigs but even pigs would be ashamed of their dirt and of the foul smell which came from them each herd was watched by the patient but inauspicious eyes of the turkeybuzzard this disgusting bird with its bald scarlet head formed to wallow in putridity is very common on the west coast and their attendance on the seals shows that they are dependant on their mortality we found the water probably only that of the surface nearly fresh this was caused by the number of torrents which in the form of cascades came tumbling over the bold granite mountains into the sea the fresh water attracts the fish and these bring many terns gulls and two kinds of cormorant we saw also a pair of the beautiful blacknecked swans and several small seaotters the fur of which is held in such high estimation in returning we were again amused by the impetuous manner in which the heap of seals old and young tumbled into the water as the boat passed they did not remain long under but rising followed us with outstretched necks expressing great wonder and curiosity thhaving run up the coast we anchored near the northern end of the chonos archipelago in lowes harbour where we remained a week the islands were here as in chiloe composed of a stratified littoral deposit of soft sandstone with shingle and the vegetation in consequence was beautifully luxuriant the woods came down to the seabeach just in the same manner as an evergreen shrubbery over a gravel walk we also enjoyed from the anchorage a splendid view of four great snowy cones of the cordillera beginning with the saddletopped volcano next el famoso corcovado and then two others to the southward the range itself had in this latitude so little elevation that few parts of it appeared above the line of the neighbouring islets we found here a party of five men from caylen el fin del cristiandad who had most adventurously crossed the open space of sea which separates chonos from chiloe in their miserable boatcanoe for the purpose of fishing these islands will in all probability in a short time become peopled like those adjoining the coast of chiloe humboldt in his essay on the kingdom of new spain has given a most interesting discussion on the history of the common potato he believes that the plant described by molina under the name of maglia is the original stock of this useful vegetable and that it grows in chile in its native soil he supposes that thence it was transported by the indian population to peru quito new granada and the whole cordillera from south to north he observes that it is a remarkable circumstance and in accordance with all records respecting the course of the stream of american population that previously to the spanish conquest it was unknown in mexico among the chonos islands a wild potato grows in abundance which in general habit is even more closely similar to the cultivated kind than is the maglia of molina these potatoes grow near the seabeach in thick beds on a sandy shelly soil wherever the trees are not too close together in the middle of january they were in flower but the tubers were small and few in number especially in those plants which grew in the shade and had the most luxuriant foliage nevertheless i found one which was of an oval form with one diameter two inches in length the raw bulbs had precisely the smell of the common potato of england but when cooked they shrunk and became watery and insipid they had not a bitter taste as according to molina is the case with the chilian kind and they could be eaten with safety some plants measured from the ground to the tip of the upper leaf not less than four feet so very close is the general resemblance with the cultivated species that it is necessary to show that they have not been imported the simple fact of their growth on the islands and even small rocks throughout the chonos archipelago which has never been inhabited and very seldom visited is an argument of some weight but the circumstance of the wildest indian tribes being well acquainted with the plant is stronger mr lowe a very intelligent and active sealer informs me that on showing some potatoes to the naked savages in the gulf of trinidad lat they immediately recognised them and calling them aquina wanted to take them away the savages also pointed to a place where they grew which fact was subsequently verified the indians of chiloe belonging to another tribe also give them a name in their own language the simple fact of their being known and named by distinct races over a space of four or five hundred miles on a most unfrequented and scarcely known coast almost proves their native existence professor henslow who has examined the dried specimens which i brought home says that they are the same with those described by mr sabine from valparaiso but that they form a variety which by some botanists has been considered as specifically distinct it is remarkable that the same plant should be found on the sterile mountains of central chile where a drop of rain does not fall for more than six months and within the damp forests of the southern islands from what we know of the habits of the potato this latter situation would appear more congenial than the former as its birthplace in the central parts of the chonos archipelago in lat the forest has assumed very much the same character which is found along the whole west coast for miles to cape horn the arborescent grass of chiloe has here ceased to exist while the beech of tierra del fuego both grows to a good size and forms a considerable proportion of the wood not however in the same exclusive manner as it does further to the southward cryptogamic plants here find a most congenial climate in the neighbourhood of the strait of magellan i have before remarked that the country appears too cold and wet to allow of their arriving at perfection but in these islands within the forest the number of species and great abundance of mosses lichens and small ferns is quite extraordinary in tierra del fuego trees grow only on the hillsides every level piece of land being invariably covered by a thick bed of peat but in chiloe the same kind of situation supports the most luxuriant forest here within the chonos archipelago the nature of the climate more closely approaches that of the southern than that of the northern of these two countries nearly every patch of level ground is covered by two species of plants astelia pumila of brown and donatia magellanica which by their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic peat in tierra del fuego above the region of woodland the former of these eminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat fresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central tap root the lower ones soon decay and in tracing a root downward in the peat the leaves yet holding their position can be observed passing through every stage of decomposition till the whole becomes blended in one confused mass the astelia is assisted by few other plants here and there a small creeping one myrtus nummularia with a woody stem like our cranberry but with a sweet berry another empetrum rubrum like our heath and a third juncus grandiflorus a rush are nearly the only ones that grow on the swampy surface these plants though possessing a very close general resemblance to the english kinds are botanically different in the more level parts of the country the surface of the peat is broken up into little pools of water which stand at different heights and appear as if artificially excavated small streams of water flowing under ground complete the disorganization of the vegetable matter and consolidate the whole the climate of the southern part of america appears particularly favourable to the production of peat in the falkland islands almost every kind of plant even the coarse grass which covers the whole surface of the island becomes converted into this substance i was at first at a loss to imagine how so much peat had been formed but the conversion of the grass at once explains it i observed that even some bones of cattle strewed on the surface were nearly covered up by the decaying matter at the foot of the blades of withered grass scarcely any situation checks its growth it overhangs the banks of running streams and encroaches on the piles of loose angular fragments of quartz rock some of the beds are of considerable thickness even as much as twelve feet the peat in the lower part is earthy and completely altered and when dry becomes so solid that it ignites with difficulty no doubt although every plant lends its aid in the process yet the astelia is the most efficient it is rather a singular circumstance as being so very different from what occurs in europe that no kind of moss forms by its decay any portion of the peat in south america with respect to the northern limit at which the climate allows of that peculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for the production of peat i believe that in chiloe lat to although there is much swampy ground no wellcharacterized substance of this nature occurs but in the chonos islands three degrees further southward we have seen that it is abundant on the eastern coast in la plata lat i was told by a spanish resident who had visited ireland that he had often sought for this substance but had never been able to find any he showed me as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered a black peaty soil so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely slow and imperfect combustion the zoology of these broken islets of the chonos archipelago is as might have been expected very poor of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds are common the myopotamus coipus like a beaver but with a round tail is well known from its fine fur which is an object of trade throughout the tributaries of la plata it here however exclusively frequents salt water which same circumstance has been mentioned as sometimes occurring with the great rodent the capybara a small seaotter is very numerous this animal does not feed exclusively on fish but like the seals draws a large supply from a small red crab which swims in shoals near the surface of the water mr bynoe saw one in tierra del fuego eating a cuttlefish and at lowes harbour another was killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large volute and this was the only specimen of that shell which was procured at one place i caught in a trap a singular little mouse it appeared common on several of the islets but the chilotans at lowes harbour said that it was not found in all what a succession of chances or what changes of level must have been brought into play thus to spread these small animals throughout this broken archipelago in all parts of chiloe and chonos two very strange birds occur which have many points of affinity with the turco and tapacolo one is called by the inhabitants cheucau pteroptochos rubecula it frequents the most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests sometimes although its cry may be heard close at hand let a person watch ever so attentively he will not see the cheucau at other times let him stand motionless and the redbreasted little bird will approach within a few feet in the most familiar manner it then busily hops about the entangled mass of rotting canes and branches with its little tail cocked upwards i opened the gizzard of some specimens it was very muscular and contained hard seeds buds of plants and vegetable fibres mixed with small stones the cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the chilotans on account of its strange and varied cries there are three very distinct kindsone is called chiduco and is an omen of good another huitreu which is extremely unfavourable and a third which i have forgotten these words are given in imitation of its cries and the natives are in some things absolutely governed by them the chilotans assuredly have chosen a most comical little creature for their prophet an allied species but rather larger is called by the natives guidguid hylactes tarnii of king and pteroptochos of kittlitz and by the english the barkingbird this latter name is well given for i defy any one at first to feel certain that a small dog is not yelping somewhere in the forest just as with the cheucau a person will sometimes hear the bark close by but in vain may endeavour by watching and with still less chance by beating the bushes to see its author yet at other times the guidguid fearlessly comes near its manner of feeding and its general habits are very similar to those of the cheucau both species are said to build their nests close to the ground amongst the rotten branches the ground being so extremely wet is a good reason why they do not burrow holes like the northern species besides the cheucau and guidguid there is another species but it is not very common moreover the bird which has been mentioned in tierra del fuego under the title of a black wren scytalopus fuscus of gould appears in its skulking habits odd cries and place of resort and likewise in some points of structure to be closely related to this singular genus on the coast a small duskycoloured bird a furnarius allied to fuliginosus is very common it is remarkable from its quiet and very tame habits it lives entirely on the seabeach and there as well as sometimes on the floating kelp picks up small seashells and crabs thus supplying the place of a sandpiper besides these birds only a few others inhabit this broken land in my rough notes i describe the strange noises which although frequently heard within these gloomy forests yet scarcely disturb the general silence the yelping of the guidguid and the sudden whewwhew of the cheucau sometimes come from afar and sometimes from close at handthe little wren occasionally adds its crythe creeper follows the intruder screaming and twitteringthe hummingbird may be seen every now and then darting from side to side and emitting like an insect its shrill chirplastly from the top of some lofty tree the indistinct but plaintive note of the whitetufted tyrantflycatcher may be noticed from the great preponderance in most countries of certain kinds of birds such as the finches one feels at first surprised at meeting with such peculiar forms above enumerated as the commonest birds in any district in central chile two of them namely the synallaxis and scytalopus occur although most rarely when finding as in this case any animal which seems to play so insignificant a part in the great scheme of nature one is apt to wonder why a distinct species should have been created but it should always be recollected that in some other country perhaps it is an essential member of society or at some former period may have been so if america south of should be sunk beneath the waters of the ocean the synallaxis and scytalopus might continue to exist in central chile for a long period but it is very improbable that their numbers would increase we should then see a case which must inevitably have happened with very many animals these southern seas are frequented by several species of petrels the largest kind procellaria gigantea or nelly quebrantahuesos or breakbones of the spaniards is a common bird both in the inland channels and on the open sea in its habits and manner of flight there is a very close resemblance with the albatross and as with the latter bird a person may watch it for hours together without seeing on what it feeds so is it with this petrel the breakbones is however a rapacious bird for it was observed by some of the officers at port st antonio chasing a diver the bird tried to escape both by diving and flying but was continually struck down and at last killed by a blow on its head at port st julian also these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls a second species puffinus cinereus which is common to europe cape horn and the coast of peru is of a much smaller size than the gigantea but like it of a dirty black colour it generally frequents the inland sounds in very large flocks i do not think i ever saw so many birds of any other sort together as i once saw of these behind the island of chiloe hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular line for several hours in one direction when part of the flock settled on the water the surface was blackened and a noise proceeded from them as of human beings talking in the distance at this time the water was in parts coloured by clouds of small crustacea at port famine every morning and evening a long band of these birds continued to fly with extreme rapidity up and down the central parts of the channel i opened the stomach of one which i shot with some difficulty for they were rather wary and it contained a small fish and seven goodsized prawnlike crabs there are several other species of petrels but i will only mention one other kind the puffinuria berardii which offers one more example of those extraordinary cases of a bird evidently belonging to one wellmarked family yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct tribe this bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds when disturbed it dives to a distance and on coming to the surface with the same movement takes wing after flying for a space in a direct course by the rapid movement of its short wings it drops as if struck dead and dives again the form of the beak and nostrils length of foot and even colouring of the plumage show that this bird is a petrel at the same time its short wings and consequent little power of flight its form of body and shape of tail its habits of diving and the absence of a hind toe to its foot and its choice of situation make it doubtful whether its relationship is not equally close with the auks as with the petrels it would undoubtedly be mistaken for one of the former when seen either on the wing or when diving and quietly swimming about the retired channels of tierra del fuego chapter xvi san

second time in the bay of s carlos in chiloe on the night of the th the volcano of osorno was in activity at midnight the sentry observed something like a large star from which state the bright spot gradually increased in size till about three oclock when a very magnificent spectacle was presented by the aid of a glass dark objects in constant succession were seen in the midst of a great red glare of light to be thrown upwards and to fall down again the light was sufficient to cast on the water a long bright reflection by the morning the volcano had resumed its tranquillity large masses of molten matter seem very commonly to be cast out of the igneous vents in this part of the cordillera i was assured that when the corcovado is in eruption great masses projected upwards are seen to burst in the air and to assume fantastical forms such as trees and other bodies one may form an idea of the immense size of these bodies when it is stated that they have been seen from the high land behind s carlos which is distant no less than ninetythree miles from the corcovado captain fitzroy being anxious that some bearings should be taken on the outer coast of chiloe it was planned that mr king and myself should ride to castro and thence across the island to the capella de cucao situated on the west coast having hired horses and a guide we set out on the morning of the d we had not proceeded far before we were joined by a woman and two boys who were bent on the same journey every one on this road acts on a hail fellow well met fashion and one may here enjoy the privilege so rare in south america of travelling without firearms at first the country consists of a succession of hills and valleys nearer to castro it becomes very level but is still some height above the sea the road itself is a curious affair it consists in its whole length with the exception of very few parts of great logs of wood which are either broad and placed longitudinally or narrow and transversely in summer the road is not very bad but in winter when the wood is rendered slippery from rain travelling is exceedingly difficult at that time of the year the ground on each side becomes a morass and is often overflowed hence it is necessary that the longitudinal logs should be fastened down by transverse poles which are pegged on each side into the earth these pegs render a fall from a horse dangerous as the chance of alighting on one of them is not small it is remarkable however how active custom has made the chilotan horses in crossing bad parts where the logs have been displaced they skipped from one to the other almost with the quickness and certainty of a dog on either hand the road is bordered by the lofty foresttrees with their bases matted together by the canes when occasionally a long reach of this avenue could be observed it presented a curious scene of uniformity the white line of logs narrowing in perspective became hidden by the gloomy forest or it terminated in a zigzag which ascended some steep hill although the distance from s carlos to castro is only twelve leagues in a straight line the formation of the road must have been a great labour i was told that several people had formerly lost their lives in attempting to cross the forest the first who succeeded was an indian who cut his way through the canes in eight days and reached s carlos he was rewarded by the spanish government with a grant of land during the summer many of the indians wander about the forests but chiefly in the higher parts where the woods are not quite so thick in search of the half wild cattle which live on the leaves of the cane and certain trees it was one of these huntsmen who by chance discovered a few years since an english vessel which had been wrecked on the outer coast the crew were beginning to fail in provisions and it is not probable that without the aid of this man they would have been able to have extricated themselves from these scarcely penetrable woods as it was one seaman died on the march from fatigue the indians in these excursions steer by the sun so that if there is a continuance of cloudy weather they cannot travel the day was beautiful and the number of trees which were in full flower perfumed the air yet even this could scarcely dissipate the effect arising from the gloomy dampness of the forest moreover the many dead trunks that stand like skeletons never fail to give to these primeval woods a character of solemnity which is wanting in those of countries long civilized shortly after sunset we bivouacked for the night our female companion who was rather goodlooking belonged to one of the most respectable families in castro she rode however astride and without shoes or stockings i was surprised at the total want of pride shown by her and her brother they brought food with them but at all our meals sat watching mr king and myself whilst eating till we were fairly shamed into feeding the whole party the night was cloudless and while lying in our beds we enjoyed the sight and it is a high enjoyment of the multitude of stars which illumined the darkness of the forest january d we rose early in the morning and reached the pretty quiet town of castro by two oclock the old governor had died since our last visit and in his place a chileno was acting
