whilst the first puts on the horsecloths and saddle and girths the whole together during this operation the horse from dread and astonishment at thus being bound round the waist throws himself over and over again on the ground and till beaten is unwilling to rise at last when the saddling is finished the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear and is white with foam and sweat the man now prepares to mount by pressing heavily on the stirrup so that the horse may not lose its balance and at the moment he throws his leg over the animals back he pulls the slipknot and the beast is free some domidors pull the knot while the animal is lying on the ground and standing over the saddle allow it to rise beneath them the horse wild with dread gives a few most violent bounds and then starts off at full gallop when quite exhausted the man by patience brings him back to the corral where reeking hot and scarcely alive the poor beast is let free those animals which will not gallop away but obstinately throw themselves on the ground are by far the most troublesome this process is tremendously severe but in two or three trials the horse is tamed it is not however for some weeks that the animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring for it must learn to associate the will of its rider with the feel of the rein before the most powerful bridle can be of any service the gauchos are well known to be perfect riders the idea of being thrown let the horse do what it likes never enters their head their criterion of a good rider is a man who can manage an untamed colt or who if his horse falls alights on his own feet or can perform other such exploits i have heard of a man betting that he would throw his horse down twenty times and that nineteen out of these he would not fall himself i recollect seeing a gaucho riding a very stubborn horse which three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with great violence the man judged with uncommon coolness the proper moment for slipping off not an instant before or after the right time directly the horse rose the man jumped on his back and at last they started at a gallop the gaucho never appears to exert any muscular force i was one day watching a good rider as we were galloping along at a rapid pace and thought to myself surely if the horse starts you appear so careless on your seat you must fall at this moment a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the horses nose the young colt bounded on one side like a stag but as for the man all that could be said was that he started and took fright as part of his horse in chile and peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than in la plata and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate nature of the country in chile a horse is not considered perfectly broken till he can be brought up standing in the midst of his full speed on any particular spotfor instance on a cloak thrown on the ground or again will charge a wall and rearing scrape the surface with his hoofs i have seen an animal bounding with spirit yet merely reined by a forefinger and thumb taken at full gallop across a courtyard and then made to wheel round the post of a verandah with great speed but at so equal a distance that the rider with outstretched arm all the while kept one finger rubbing the post then making a demivolte in the air with the other arm outstretched in a like manner he wheeled round with astonishing force in an opposite direction such a horse is well broken and although this at first may appear useless it is far otherwise it is only carrying that which is daily necessary into perfection when a bullock is checked and caught by the lazo it will sometimes gallop round and round in a circle and the horse being alarmed at the great strain if not well broken will not readily turn like the pivot of a wheel in consequence many men have been killed for if the lazo once takes a twist round a mans body it will instantly from the power of the two opposed animals almost cut him in twain on the same principle the races are managed the course is only two or three hundred yards long the desideratum being to have horses that can make a rapid dash the racehorses are trained not only to stand with their hoofs touching a line but to draw all four feet together so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action of the hind quarters in chile i was told an anecdote which i believe was true and it offers a good illustration of the use of a wellbroken animal a respectable man riding one day met two others one of whom was mounted on a horse which he knew to have been stolen from himself he challenged them they answered him by drawing their sabres and giving chase the man on his good and fleet beast kept just ahead as he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it and brought up his horse to a dead check the pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and ahead then instantly dashing on right behind them he buried his knife in the back of one wounded the other recovered his horse from the dying robber and rode home for these feats of horsemanship two things are necessary a most severe bit like the mameluke the power of which though seldom used the horse knows full well and large blunt spurs that can be applied either as a mere touch or as an instrument of extreme pain i conceive that with english spurs the slightest touch of which pricks the skin it would be impossible to break in a horse after the southamerican fashion at an estancia near las vacas large numbers of mares are weekly slaughtered for the sake of their hides although worth only five paper dollars or about halfacrown apiece it seems at first strange that it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle but as it is thought ridiculous in this country ever to break in or to ride a mare they are of no value except for breeding the only thing for which i ever saw mares used was to tread out wheat from the ear for which purpose they were driven round a circular enclosure where the wheatsheaves were strewed the man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo standing at the distance of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral he has laid a wager that he would catch by the legs every animal without missing one as it rushed past him there was another man who said he would enter the corral on foot catch a mare fasten her front legs together drive her out throw her down kill skin and stake the hide for drying which latter is a tedious job and he engaged that he would perform this whole operation on twentytwo animals in one day or he would kill and take the skin off fifty in the same time this would have been a prodigious task for it is considered a good days work to skin and stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals november thi set out on my return in a direct line for monte video having heard of some giants bones at a neighbouring farmhouse on the sarandis a small stream entering the rio negro i rode there accompanied by my host and purchased for the value of eighteen pence the head of an animal equalling in size that of the hippopotamus mr owen in a paper read before the geological society has called this very extraordinary animal toxodon from the curvature of its teeth the following notice is taken from the proceedings of that society mr owen says judging from the portion of the skeleton preserved the toxodon as far as dental characters have weight must be referred to the rodent order but from that order it deviates in the relative position of its supernumerary incisors in the number and direction of the curvature of its molars and in some other respects it again deviates in several parts of its structure which mr owen enumerated both from the rodentia and the existing pachydermata and it manifests an affinity to the dinotherium and the cetaceous order mr owen however observed that the development of the nasal cavity and the presence of frontal sinuses renders it extremely improbable that the habits of the toxodon were so exclusively aquatic as would result from the total absence of hinder extremities and concludes therefore that it was a quadruped and not a cetacean and that it manifested an additional step in the gradation of mammiferous forms leading from the rodentia through the pachydermata to the cetacea a gradation of which the waterhog of south america hydroch√¶rus capybara already indicates the commencement amongst existing rodentia of which order it is interesting to observe this species is the largest while at the same time it is peculiar to the continent in which the remains of the gigantic toxodon were discovered the people at the farmhouse told me that the remains were exposed by a flood having washed down part of a bank of earth when found the head was quite perfect but the boys knocked the teeth out with stones and then set up the head as a mark to throw at by a most fortunate chance i found a perfect tooth which exactly fits one of the sockets in this skull embedded by itself on the banks of the rio tercero at the distance of about miles from this place near the toxodon i found the fragments of the head of an animal rather larger than the horse which has some points of resemblance with the toxodon and others perhaps with the edentata the head of this animal as well as that of the toxodon and especially the former appear so fresh that it is difficult to believe they have lain buried for ages under ground the bone contains so much animal matter that when heated in the flame of a spiritlamp it not only exhales a very strong animal odour but likewise burns with a slight flame at the distance of a few leagues i visited a place where the remains of another great animal associated with large pieces of armadillolike covering had been found similar pieces were likewise lying in the bed of the stream close to the spot where the skeleton of the toxodon had been exposed these portions are dissimilar from those mentioned at bahia blanca it is a most interesting fact thus to discover that more than one gigantic animal in former ages was protected by a coat of mail very similar to the kind now found on the numerous species of armadillo and exclusively confined to that southamerican genus by the middle of the day on the th we arrived at monte video having been two days and a half on the road the country for the whole way was of a very uniform character some parts being rather more rocky and hilly than near the plata not far from monte video we passed through the village of las pietras so named from some large rounded masses of syenite its appearance was rather pretty in this country a few figtrees around the houses and a site elevated a hundred feet above the general level ought always to be called picturesque during the last six months i have had an opportunity of seeing a little of the character of the inhabitants of these provinces the gauchos or countrymen are very superior to those who reside in the towns the gaucho is invariably most obliging polite and hospitable i did not meet even with one instance of rudeness or inhospitality he is modest both respecting himself and country at the same time being a spirited bold fellow on the other hand there is much blood shed and many robberies committed the constant presence of the knife is the chief cause of the former it is lamentable to hear how many lives are lost in trifling quarrels in fighting each party tries to mark the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes as is often attested by deep and horridlooking scars robberies are a natural consequence of universal gambling much drinking and extreme indolence at mercedes i asked two men why they did not work one gravely said the days were too long the other that he was too poor the number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of all industry moreover there are so many feastdays and then nothing can succeed without it is begun when the moon is on the increase so that half the month is lost from these two causes police and justice are quite inefficient if a man who is poor commits murder and is taken he will be imprisoned and perhaps even shot but if he is rich and has friends he may rely on it no very severe consequence will ensue it is curious that the most respectable people in the country invariably assist a murderer to escape they seem to think the individual sins against the governing powers and not against the state a traveller has no protection besides his firearms and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to a more frequent occurrence of robbery the character of the higher and more educated classes who reside in the towns partakes but perhaps in a lesser degree of the good parts of the gaucho but is i fear stained by many vices of which he is free sensuality mockery of all religion and the grossest corruption are far from uncommon nearly every public officer can be bribed the head man in the postoffice sold forged government franks the governor and prime minister openly combined to plunder the state justice where gold came into play was hardly expected by any one i knew an englishman who went to the chief justice he told me that not understanding the ways of the place he trembled as he entered the room and said sir i have come to offer you dollars value about five pounds sterling if you will arrest before a certain time a man who has cheated me i know it is against the law but my lawyer naming him recommended me to take this step the chief justice smiled acquiescence thanked him and the man before night was safe in prison with this entire want of principle in many of the leading men with the country full of illpaid turbulent officers the people yet hope that a democratic form of government can succeed on first entering society in these countries two or three features strike one as particularly remarkable the polite and dignified manners pervading every grade of life the excellent taste displayed by the women in their dresses and the equality amongst all ranks at the rio colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with general rosas a son of a major at bahia blanca gained his livelihood by making paper cigars and he wished to accompany me as guide or servant to buenos ayres but his father objected on the score of the danger alone many officers in the army can neither read nor write yet all meet in society as equals in entre rios the sala consisted of only six representatives one of them kept a common shop and evidently was not degraded by the office all this is what would be expected in a new country nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by profession appears to an englishman something strange when speaking of these countries the manner in which they have been brought up by their unnatural parent spain should always be borne in mind on the whole perhaps more credit is due for what has been done than blame for that which may be deficient it is impossible to doubt but that the extreme liberalism of these countries must ultimately lead to good results the very general toleration of foreign religions the regard paid to the means of education the freedom of the press the facilities offered to all foreigners and especially as i am bound to add to every one professing the humblest pretensions to science should be recollected with gratitude by those who have visited spanish south america chapter ix rio plata flocks of butterflies beetles alive in the sea aeronaut

transport of pebbles fossil gigantic llama types of organization constant change in zoology of america causes of extinction patagonia december th the beagle sailed from the rio plata never again to enter its muddy stream our course was directed to port desire on the coast of patagonia before proceeding any further i will here put together a few observations made at sea several times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the plata and at other times when off the shores of northern patagonia we have been surrounded by insects one evening when we were about ten miles from the bay of san blas vast numbers of butterflies in bands or flocks of countless myriads extended as far as the eye could range even by the aid of a glass it was not possible to see a space free from butterflies the seamen cried out it was snowing butterflies and such in fact was the appearance more species than one were present but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to but not identical with the common english colias edusa some moths and hymenoptera accompanied the butterflies and a fine calosoma flew on board other instances are known of this beetle having been caught far out at sea and this is the more remarkable as the greater number of the carabid√¶ seldom or never take wing the day had been fine and calm and the one previous to it equally so with light and variable airs hence we cannot suppose that the insects were blown off the land but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight the great bands of the colias seem at first to afford an instance like those on record of the migrations of vanessa cardui but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct and not so easily intelligible before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the north and this must have been the cause of tens of thousands of the butterflies and other insects having perished on another occasion when seventeen miles off cape corrientes i had a net overboard to catch pelagic animals upon drawing it up to my surprise i found a considerable number of beetles in it and although in the open sea they did not appear much injured by the salt water i lost some of the specimens but those which i preserved belonged to the genera colymbetes hydroporus hydrobius two species notaphus cynucus adimonia and scarab√¶us at first i thought that these insects had been blown from the shore but upon reflecting that out of the eight species four were aquatic and two others partly so in their habits it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the sea by a small stream which drains a lake near cape corrientes on any supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find insects quite alive swimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of land there are several accounts of insects having been blown off the patagonian shore captain cook observed it as did more lately captain king in the adventure the cause probably is due to the want of shelter both of trees and hills so that an insect on the wing with an offshore breeze would be very apt to be blown out to sea the most remarkable instance i ever knew of an insect being caught far from the land was that of a large grasshopper acrydium which flew on board when the beagle was to windward of the cape de verd islands and when the nearest point of land not directly opposed to the tradewind was cape blanco on the coast of africa miles distant on several occasions when the vessel has been within the mouth of the plata the rigging has been coated with the web of the gossamer spider one day november st i paid particular attention to the phenomenon the weather had been fine and clear and in the morning the air was full of patches of the flocculent web as on an autumnal day in england the ship was sixty miles distant from the land in the direction of a steady though light breeze vast numbers of a small spider about onetenth of an inch in length and of a dusky red colour were attached to the webs there must have been i should suppose some thousands on the ship the little spider when first coming in contact with the rigging was always seated on a single thread and not on the flocculent mass this latter seems merely to be produced by the entanglement of the single threads the spiders were all of one species but of both sexes together with young ones these latter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour i will not give the description of this spider but merely state that it does not appear to me to be included in any of latreilles genera the little aeronaut as soon as it arrived on board was very active running about sometimes letting itself fall and then reascending the same thread sometimes employing itself in making a small and very irregular mesh in the corners between the ropes it could run with facility on the surface of water when disturbed it lifted up its front legs in the attitude of attention on its first arrival it appeared very thirsty and with exserted maxill√¶ drank eagerly of the fluid this same circumstance has been observed by strack may it not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a dry and rarefied atmosphere its stock of web seemed inexhaustible while watching some that were suspended by a single thread i several times observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of sight in a horizontal line on another occasion th under similar circumstances i repeatedly observed the same kind of small spider either when placed or having crawled on some little eminence elevate its abdomen send forth a thread and then sail away in a lateral course but with a rapidity which was quite unaccountable i thought i could perceive that the spider before performing the above preparatory steps connected its legs together with the most delicate threads but i am not sure whether this observation is correct one day at st fe i had a better opportunity of observing some similar facts a spider which was about threetenths of an inch in length and which in its general appearance resembled a citigrade therefore quite different from the gossamer while standing on the summit of a post darted forth four or five threads from its spinners these glittering in the sunshine might be compared to rays of light they were not however straight but in undulations like a film of silk blown by the wind they were more than a yard in length and diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices the spider then suddenly let go its hold and was quickly borne out of sight the day was hot and apparently quite calm yet under such circumstances the atmosphere can never be so tranquilas not to affect a vane so delicate as the thread of a spiders web if during a warm day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank or over a level plain at a distant landmark the effect of an ascending current of heated air will almost always be evident and this probably would be sufficient to carry with it so light an object as the little spider on its thread the circumstance of spiders of the same species but of different sexes and ages being found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the land attached in vast numbers to the lines proves that they are the manufacturers of the mesh and that the habit of sailing through the air is probably as characteristic of some tribe as that of diving is of the argyroneta we may then reject latreilles supposition that the gossamer owes its origin to the webs of the young of several genera as epeira or thomisa although as we have seen that the young of other spiders do possess the power of performing aerial voyages during our different passages south of the plata i often towed astern a net made of bunting and thus caught many curious animals the structure of the beroe a kind of jelly fish is most extraordinary with its rows of vibratory cili√¶ and complicated though irregular system of circulation of crustacea there were many strange and undescribed genera one which in some respects is allied to the notopods or those crabs which have their posterior legs placed almost on their backs for the purpose of adhering to the under side of ledges is very remarkable from the structure of its hind pair of legs the penultimate joint instead of being terminated by a simple claw ends in three bristlelike appendages of dissimilar lengthsthe longest equalling that of the entire leg these claws are very thin and are serrated with teeth of an excessive fineness which are directed towards the base the curved extremities are flattened and on this part five most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner as the suckers on the arms of the cuttlefish as the animal lives in the open sea and probably wants a place of rest i suppose this beautiful structure is adapted to take hold of the globular bodies of the medus√¶ and other floating marine animals in deep water far from the land the number of living creatures is extremely small south of the latitude i never succeeded in catching any thing besides some beroe and a few species of minute crustacea belonging to the entomostraca in shoaler water at the distance of a few miles from the coast very many kinds of crustacea and some other animals were numerous but only during the night between latitudes and south of cape horn the net was put astern several times it never however brought up any thing besides a few of two extremely minute species of entomostraca yet whales and seals petrels and albatross are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean it has always been a source of mystery to me on what the latter which live far from the shore can subsist i presume the albatross like the condor is able to fast long and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid whale lasts for a long siege of hunger it does not lessen the difficulty to say they feed on fish for on what can the fish feed it often occurred to me when observing how the waters of the central and intertropical parts of the atlantic swarmed with pteropoda crustacea and radiata and with their devourers the flyingfish and again with their devourers the bonitos and albicores that the lowest of these pelagic animals perhaps possess the power of decomposing carbonic acid gas like the members of the vegetable kingdom while sailing in these latitudes on one very dark night the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle there was a fresh breeze and every part of the surface which during the day is seen as foam now glowed with a pale light the vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus and in her wake she was followed by a milky train as far as the eye reached the crest of every wave was bright and the sky above the horizon from the reflected glare of these livid flames was not so utterly obscure as over the rest of the heavens as we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent and off cape horn i do not recollect more than once having seen it so and then it was far from being brilliant this circumstance probably has a close connexion with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of the ocean after the elaborate paper by ehrenberg on the phosphorescence of the sea it is almost superfluous on my part to make any observations on the subject i may however add that the same torn and irregular particles of gelatinous matter described by ehrenberg seem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the common cause of this phenomenon the particles were so minute as easily to pass through fine gauze yet many were distinctly visible by the naked eye the water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave out sparks but a small portion in a watchglass scarcely ever was luminous ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain degree of irritability my observations some of which were made directly after taking up the water would give a different result i may also mention that having used the net during one night i allowed it to become partially dry and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to employ it again i found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when first taken out of the water it does not appear probable in this case that the particles could have remained so long alive i remark also in my notes that having kept a medusa of the genus dian√¶a till it was dead the water in which it was placed became luminous when the waves scintillate with bright green sparks i believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea but there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals when alive are phosphorescent on two occasions i have observed the sea luminous at considerable depths beneath the surface near the mouth of the plata some circular and oval patches from two to four yards in diameter and with defined outlines shone with a steady but pale light while the surrounding water only gave out a few sparks the appearance resembled the reflection of the moon or some luminous body for the edges were sinuous from the undulation of the surface the ship which drew thirteen feet water passed over without disturbing these patches therefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together at a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel near fernando noronha the sea gave out light in flashes the appearance was very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish moving rapidly through a luminous fluid to this cause the sailors attributed it at the time however i entertained some doubts on account of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes with respect to any general observations i have already stated that the display is very much more common in warm than in cold countries i have sometimes imagined that a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its production certainly i think the sea is most luminous after a few days of more calm weather than ordinary during which time it has swarmed with various animals observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in an impure state and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the fluid in contact with the atmosphere i have always been inclined to consider that the phosphorescence was the result of the decomposition of the organic particles by which process one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration the ocean becomes purified december dwe arrived at port desire situated in lat on the coast of patagonia the creek runs for about twenty miles inland with an irregular width the beagle anchored a few miles within the entrance in front of the ruins of an old spanish settlement the same evening i went on shore the first landing in any new country is very interesting and especially when as in this case the whole aspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character at the height of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of porphyry a wide plain extends which is truly characteristic of patagonia the surface is quite level and is composed of wellrounded shingle mixed with a whitish earth here and there scattered tufts of brown wiry grass are supported and still more rarely some low thorny bushes the weather is dry and pleasant for the fine blue sky is but seldom obscured when standing in the middle of one of these desert plains the view on one side is generally bounded by the escarpment of another plain rather higher but equally level and desolate and on the other side it becomes indistinct from the trembling mirage which seems to rise from the heated surface the plains are traversed by many broad flatbottomed valleys and in these the bushes grow rather more abundantly the present drainage of the country is quite insufficient to excavate such large channels in some of the valleys ancient stunted trees growing in the very centre of the dry watercourse seem as if placed to prove how long a time had elapsed since any flood had passed that way we have evidence from shells lying on the surface that the plains of gravel have been elevated within a recent epoch above the level of the sea and we must look to that period for the excavation of the valleys by the slowlyretiring waters from the dryness of the climate a man may walk for days together over these plains without finding a single drop of water even at the base of the porphyry hills there are only a few small wells containing but little water and that rather saline and half putrid in such a country the fate of the spanish settlement was soon decided the dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year and the occasional hostile attacks of the wandering indians compelled the colonists to desert their halffinished buildings the style however in which they were commenced showed the strong and liberal hand of spain in the old time the end of all the attempts to colonize this side of america south of have been miserable at port famine the name expresses the lingering and extreme sufferings of several hundred wretched people of whom one alone survived to relate their misfortunes at st josephs bay on the coast of patagonia a small settlement was made but during one sunday the indians made an attack and massacred the whole party excepting two men who were led captive many years among the wandering tribes at the rio negro i conversed with one of these men now in extreme old age the zoology of patagonia is as limited as its flora on the arid plains a few black beetles heteromera might be seen slowly crawling about and occasionally a lizard darting from side to side of birds we have three carrion hawks and in the valleys a few finches and insect feeders the ibis malanops a species said to be found in central africa is not uncommon on the most desert parts in the stomachs of these birds i found grasshoppers cicad√¶ small lizards and even scorpions at one time of the year they go in flocks at another in pairs their cry is very loud and singular and resembles the neighing of the guanaco i will here give an account of this latter animal which is very common and is the characteristic quadruped of the plains of patagonia the guanaco which by some naturalists is considered as the same animal with the llama but in its wild state is the south american representative of the camel of the east in size it may be compared to an ass mounted on taller legs and with a very long neck the guanaco abounds over the whole of the temperate parts of south america from the wooded islands of tierra del fuego through patagonia the hilly parts of la plata chile even to the cordillera of peru although preferring an elevated site it yields in this respect to its near relative the vicuna on the plains of southern patagonia we saw them in greater numbers than in any other part generally they go in small herds from half a dozen to thirty together but on the banks of the st cruz we saw one herd which must have contained at least five hundred on the northern shores of the strait of magellan they are also very numerous generally the guanacoes are wild and extremely wary mr stokes told me that he one day saw through a glass a herd of these beasts which evidently had been frightened running away at full speed although their distance was so great that they could not be distinguished by the naked eye the sportsman frequently receives the first intimation of their presence by hearing from a long distance the peculiar shrill neighing note of alarm if he then looks attentively he will perhaps see the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill on approaching them a few more squeals are given and then off they set at an apparently slow but really quick canter along some narrow beaten track to a neighbouring hill if however by chance he should abruptly meet a single animal or several together they will generally stand motionless and intently gaze at him then perhaps move on a few yards turn round and look again what is the cause of this difference in their shiness do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief enemy the puma or does curiosity overcome their timidity that they are curious is certain for if a person lies on the ground and plays strange antics such as throwing up his feet in the air they will almost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him it was an artifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success and it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be fired which were all taken as parts of the performance on the mountains of tierra del fuego and in other places i have more than once seen a guanaco on being approached not only neigh and squeal but prance and leap about in the most ridiculous manner apparently in defiance as a challenge these animals are very easily domesticated and i have seen some thus kept near the houses although at large on their native plains they are in this state very bold and readily attack a man by striking him from behind with both knees it is asserted that the motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their females the wild guanacoes however have no idea of defence even a single dog will secure one of these large animals till the huntsman can come up in many of their habits they are like sheep in a flock thus when they see men approaching in several directions on horseback they soon became bewildered and know not which way to run this greatly facilitates the indian method of hunting for they are thus easily driven to a central point and are encompassed the guanacoes readily take to the water several times at port valdes they were seen swimming from island to island byron in his voyage says he saw them drinking salt water some of our officers likewise saw a herd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near cape blanco i imagine in several parts of the country if they do not drink salt water they drink none at all in the middle of the day they frequently roll in the dust in saucershaped hollows the males fight together two one day passed quite close to me squealing and trying to bite each other and several were shot with their hides deeply scored herds sometimes appear to set out on exploringparties at bahia blanca where within thirty miles of the coast these animals are extremely unfrequent i one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty which had come in a direct line to a muddy saltwater creek they then must have perceived that they were approaching the sea for they had wheeled with the regularity of cavalry and had returned back in as straight a line as they had advanced the guanacoes have one singular habit which is to me quite inexplicable namely that on successive days they drop their dung in the same defined heap i saw one of these heaps which was eight feet in diameter and necessarily was composed of a large quantity frezier remarks on this habit as common to the guanaco as well as to the llama he says it is very useful to the indians who use the dung for fuel and are thus saved the trouble of collecting it the guanacoes appear to have favourite spots for dying in on the banks of the st cruz the ground was actually white with bones in certain circumscribed spaces which were generally bushy and all near the river on one such spot i counted between ten and twenty heads i particularly examined the bones they did not appear as some scattered ones which i had seen gnawed or broken as if dragged together by beasts of prey the animals in most cases must have crawled before dying beneath and amongst the bushes mr bynoe informs me that during the last voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks of the rio gallegos i do not at all understand the reason of this but i may observe that the wounded guanacoes at the st cruz invariably walked towards the river at st jago in the cape de verd islands i remember having seen in a retired ravine a corner under a cliff where numerous goats bones were collected we at the time exclaimed that it was the burialground of all the goats in the island i mention these trifling circumstances because in certain cases they might explain the occurrence of a number of uninjured bones in a cave or buried under alluvial accumulations and likewise the cause why certain mammalia are more commonly embedded than others in sedimentary deposits any great flood of the st cruz would wash down many bones of the guanaco but probably not a single one of the puma ostrich or fox i may also observe that almost every kind of waterfowl when wounded takes to the shore to die so that the remains of birds from this cause alone and independently of other reasons would but rarely be preserved in a fossil state one day the yawl was sent under the command of mr chaffers with three days provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour in the morning we searched for some wateringplaces mentioned in an old spanish chart we found one creek at the head of which there was a trickling rill the first we had seen of brackish water here the tide compelled us to wait several hours and in the interval i walked some miles into the interior the plain as usual consisted of gravel mingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance but very different from it in nature from the softness of these materials it was worn into many gullies there was not a tree and excepting the guanaco which stood on the hilltop a watchful sentinel over its herd scarcely an animal or a bird all was stillness and desolation one reflected how many ages the plain had thus lasted and how many more it was doomed thus to continue yet in passing over these scenes without one bright object near an illdefined but strong sense of pleasure is vividly excited in the evening we sailed a few miles further up and then pitched the tents for the night by the middle of the next day the yawl was aground and from the shoalness of the water could not proceed any higher the water being found partly fresh mr chaffers took the dingey and went up two or three miles further where she also grounded but in a freshwater river the water was muddy and though the stream was most insignificant in size it would be difficult to account for its source except from the melting snow on the the cordillera at the spot where we bivouacked we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep pinnacles of porphyry i do not think i ever saw a spot which appeared more secluded from the rest of the world than this rocky crevice in the wide plain the second day after our return to the anchorage a party of officers and myself went to ransack an old indian grave which i had found on the summit of a neighbouring hill two immense stones each probably weighing at least a couple of tons had been placed in front of a ledge of rock about six feet high at the bottom of the grave on the hard rock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep which must have been brought up from the plain below above it a pavement of flat stones was placed on which others were piled so as to fill up the space between the ledge and the two great blocks to complete the grave the indians had contrived to detach from the same ledge a huge fragment and to throw it over the pile so as to rest on the two blocks we undermined the grave on both sides but could not find any relics or even bones the latter probably had decayed long since in which case the grave must have been of extreme antiquity for i found in another place some smaller heaps beneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be distinguished as having belonged to a man falconer states that where an indian dies he is buried but that subsequently his bones are carefully taken up and carried let the distance be ever so great to be deposited near the seacoast this custom i think may be accounted for by recollecting that before the introduction of horses these indians must have led nearly the same life as the fuegians and therefore generally resided in the neighbourhood of the sea the common prejudice of lying where ones ancestors have lain would make the now roaming indians bring the less perishable part of their dead to their ancient burialgrounds january th before it was dark the beagle anchored in the fine spacious harbour of port st julian situated about one hundred and ten miles to the south of port desire we remained here eight days the country is nearly similar to that of port desire but perhaps rather more sterile one day a party accompanied captain fitzroy on a long walk round the head of the harbour we were eleven hours without tasting any water and some of the party were quite exhausted from the summit of a hill since well named thirsty hill a fine lake was spied and two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show whether it was fresh water what was our disappointment to find a snowwhite expanse of salt crystallized in great cubes we attributed our extreme thirst to the dryness of the atmosphere but whatever the cause might be we were exceedingly glad late in the evening to get back to the boats although we could nowhere find during our whole visit a single drop of fresh water yet some must exist for by an odd chance i found on the surface of the salt water near the head of the bay a colymbetes not quite dead which in all probability had lived in some not far distant pool three other kinds of insectsa cincindela like hybrida cymindis and a harpalus which all live on muddy flats occasionally overflowed by the sea and one other beetle found dead on the plaincompletes the list of coleoptera a goodsized fly tabanus was extremely numerous and tormented us by its painful bite the common horsefly which is so troublesome in the shady lanes of england belongs to this genus we here have the puzzle that so frequently occurs in the case of musquitoes on the blood of what animals do these insects commonly feed the guanaco is nearly the only warmblooded quadruped and they are present in numbers quite inconsiderable compared to the multitude of flies the foundation of porphyry is not here present as it was at port desire and in consequence the tertiary deposits are arranged with greater regularity five successive plains of different altitudes are very distinct the lower one is a mere fringe nearly on a level with the sea but the upper one is elevated feet this latter is represented in this neighbourhood only by a few truncate conical hills of exactly the same height it was very interesting to stand on one of these flat patches of gravel and viewing the wide surrounding country to speculate on the enormous quantity of matter which must have been removed thus to leave these mere points as meaures of the former tableland i will now give a brief sketch of the geology of the grand tertiary formation of patagonia which extends from the strait of magellan to the bay of s antonio in europe deposits of the more recent eras have generally been accumulated in small basins or troughshaped hollows in south america however the entire plains of patagonia extending seven hundred miles in length and backed on the one hand by the chain of the andes and fronted on the other by the shores of the atlantic are thus constituted moreover the northern boundary is merely assumed in consequence of a mineralogical change in the strata if organic remains were present it probably would be found to be only an artificial limit again to the northward miles distant from the strait of magellan we have the pampas deposit which though very different in composition belongs to the same epoch with the superficial covering of the plains of patagonia the cliffs on the coast give the following section the lower part consists of a soft sandstone containing large concretions of a harder nature these strata contain many organic remainsimmense oysters nearly a foot in diameter curious pectens echini turritell√¶ and other shells of which the greater portion are extinct but a few resemble those now existing on the coast above these fossiliferous beds a mass of soft friable stone or earth is superimposed which from its extreme whiteness has been mistaken for chalk it is however quite different and closely resembles the less argillaceous varieties of decomposed felspar this substance never contains organic remains lastly the cliff is surmounted by a thick bed of gravel almost exclusively derived from porphyritic rocks for the sake of making the following description more easily intelligible i have subjoined an imaginary section of the plains near the coast it must be observed that the width of each plain is in nature very much greater in proportion to the height than here represented the whole series is horizontally stratified and i do not recollect ever seeing any signs of violence not even such as a fault the gravel covers the entire surface of the land from the rio colorado to the strait of magellan a space of miles and is one chief cause of the desert character of patagonia judging from a section across the continent at the st cruz river and from some other reasons i believe the gravel beds gradually thickening as they ascend every where reach the base of the cordillera it is to these mountains we must look for the parent rocks of at least a large portion of the wellrounded fragments i apprehend so great an area covered by shingle could scarcely be pointed out in any other part of the world having said thus much of the constitution let us look at the external configuration of the mass the level plains are cut off along the whole line of coast by perpendicular cliffs which are necessarily of different altitudes because any one of the successive terraces which as i have already noticed rise like steps one above the other may form the sea cliff these steps are often several miles broad but from one point of view i have seen four very distinct lines of escarpment abutting one over the other having observed that the plains appeared to run for great distances along the coast at the same level i measured barometrically the elevation of some of them and compared these measurements and took all those made by the officers employed in the survey i was astonished to find at how great distances even of miles plains occurred that had within a few feet of difference the same elevation i believe i can distinguish seven or eight distinct terraces which occur along the line of coast and which include heights between feet and the level of the sea it will be understood that they are not always present for the lower ones have in some parts been removed by the action of the sea sooner than in others when any broad valley enters the country the terraces sweep round and run up on each side in which case the correspondence on the opposite sides is beautifully illustrated i have called these steplike plains level because they appear to be absolutely so to the eye but in truth they rise a little between the edge of one line of cliff and the base of the next above it their slope is about the same as that of the gradually shoaling bottom of the neighbouring sea the elevation of feet is gained by three steps one of about feet the second and the third over these three plains marine remains are frequently scattered but they are especially abundant on the lower one the shells are the same as the now existing littoral species and the muscle and turbo yet partially retain their blue and purple colours we have now stated the problem which is to be explained so as to connect together these various phenomena at first i could only understand the grand covering of gravel by the supposition of some epoch of extreme violence and the successive lines of cliff by as many great elevations the precise action of which i could not however follow out guided by the principles of geology and having under my view the vast changes going on in this continent which at the present day seems the great workshop of nature i came to another and i hope more satisfactory conclusion the importance of any view which may explain the agency by which such vast beds of shingle have been transported over the surface of the successive plains cannot be doubted whatever the cause may have been it has determined the condition of this desert country with respect to its form nature and capabilities of supporting life there are proofs that the whole coast has been elevated to a considerable height within the recent period and on the shores of the pacific where successive terraces likewise occur we know that these changes have latterly been very gradual there is indeed reason for believing that the uplifting of the ground during the earthquakes in chile although only to the height of two or three feet has been a disturbance which may be considered as a great one in comparison to the series of lesser and scarcely sensible movements which are likewise in progress let us then imagine the consequence of the shoaling bed of an ocean elevated at a perfectly equable rate so that the same number of feet should be converted into dry land in each succeeding century every part of the surface would then have been exposed for an equal length of time to the action of the beachline and the whole in consequence equally modified the shoaling bed of the ocean would thus be changed into a sloping land with no marked line on it if however there should occur a long period of repose in the elevations and the currents of the sea should tend to wear away the land as happens along this whole coast then there would be formed a line of cliff accordingly as the repose was long so would be the quantity of land consumed and the consequent height of such cliffs let the elevations recommence and another sloping bank of shingle or sand or mud according to the nature of the successive beachlines must be formed which again will be broken by as many lines of cliff as there shall be periods of rest in the action of the subterranean forces now this is the structure of the plains of patagonia and such gradual changes harmonize well with the undisturbed strata extending over so many hundred miles i must here observe that i am far from supposing that the entire coast of this part of the continent has ever been lifted up to the height of even a foot at any one moment of time but drawing our analogies from the shores of the pacific that the whole may have been insensibly rising with every now and then a paroxysmal or accelerated movement in certain spots with respect to the alternation of the periods of such continued rise and those of quiescence we may grant that they are probable because such alternation agrees with what we see in the action not only of a single volcano but likewise of the disturbances affecting whole regions of the earth at the present day to the north of the parallel the subterranean forces are constantly manifesting their power over a space of more than one thousand miles but to the southward of that line as far as cape horn an earthquake is seldom or never experienced and there is not a single point of eruption yet in former ages as we shall hereafter show deluges of lava flowed from that very part it is in conformity with our hypothesis that this southern region of repose is at present suffering from the inroads of the ocean as attested by the long line of cliff on the patagonian coast such we believe to have been the causes of this singular configuration of the land nevertheless we confess that it at first appears startling that the most marked intervals between the heights of the successive plains should instead of some great and sudden action of the subterranean forces only indicate a longer period of repose in explaining the widelyspread bed of gravel we must first suppose a great
