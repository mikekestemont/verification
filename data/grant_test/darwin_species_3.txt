pair hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends i think to mislead us we see no great destruction falling on them and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of the only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand and those which produce extremely few is that the slowbreeders would require a few more years to people under favourable conditions a whole district let it be ever so large the condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two the fulmar petrel lays but one egg yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world one fly deposits hundreds of eggs and another like the hippobosca a single one but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district a large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food for it allows them rapidly to increase in number but the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one if an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young a small number may be produced and yet the average stock be fully kept up but if many eggs or young are destroyed many must be produced or the species will become extinct it would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree which lived on an average for a thousand years if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place so that in all cases the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds in looking at nature it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mindnever to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals lighten any check mitigate the destruction ever so little and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount the face of nature may be compared to a yielding surface with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows sometimes one wedge being struck and then another with greater force what checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure look at the most vigorous species by as much as it swarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased we know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head even in regard to mankind so incomparably better known than any other animal this subject has been ably treated by several authors and i shall in my future work discuss some of the checks at considerable length more especially in regard to the feral animals of south america here i will make only a few remarks just to recall to the readers mind some of the chief points eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most but this is not invariably the case with plants there is a vast destruction of seeds but from some observations which i have made i believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants seedlings also are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies for instance on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide dug and cleared and where there could be no choking from other plants i marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up and out of the no less than were destroyed chiefly by slugs and insects if turf which has long been mown and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds be let to grow the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous though fully grown plants thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf three feet by four nine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely the amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can increase but very frequently it is not the obtaining food but the serving as prey to other animals which determines the average numbers of a species thus there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges grouse and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin if not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in england and at the same time if no vermin were destroyed there would in all probability be less game than at present although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed on the other hand in some cases as with the elephant and rhinoceros none are destroyed by beasts of prey even the tiger in india most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought i believe to be the most effective of all checks i estimated that the winter of destroyed fourfifths of the birds in my own grounds and this is a tremendous destruction when we remember that ten per cent is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man the action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals whether of the same or of distinct species which subsist on the same kind of food even when climate for instance extreme cold acts directly it will be the least vigorous or those which have got least food through the advancing winter which will suffer most when we travel from south to north or from a damp region to a dry we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer and finally disappearing and the change of climate being conspicuous we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action but this is a very false view we forget that each species even where it most abounds is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate they will increase in numbers and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants the other species will decrease when we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured as in this one being hurt so it is when we travel northward but in a somewhat lesser degree for the number of species of all kinds and therefore of competitors decreases northwards hence in going northward or in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stunted forms due to the directly injurious action of climate than we do in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain when we reach the arctic regions or snowcapped summits or absolute deserts the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements that climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate but which never become naturalised for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our native animals when a species owing to highly favourable circumstances increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract epidemicsat least this seems generally to occur with our game animalsoften ensue and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life but even some of these socalled epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms which have from some cause possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals been disproportionably favoured and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey on the other hand in many cases a large stock of individuals of the same species relatively to the numbers of its enemies is absolutely necessary for its preservation thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rapeseed c in our fields because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them nor can the birds though having a superabundance of food at this one season increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed as their numbers are checked during winter but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden i have in this case lost every single seed this view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation explains i believe some singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur and that of some social plants being social that is abounding in individuals even on the extreme confines of their range for in such cases we may believe that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together and thus save each other from utter destruction i should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing and the ill effects of close interbreeding probably come into play in some of these cases but on this intricate subject i will not here enlarge many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings which have to struggle together in the same country i will give only a single instance which though a simple one has interested me in staffordshire on the estate of a relation where i had ample means of investigation there was a large and extremely barren heath which had never been touched by the hand of man but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twentyfive years previously and planted with scotch fir the change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another not only the proportional numbers of the heathplants were wholly changed but twelve species of plants not counting grasses and carices flourished in the plantations which could not be found on the heath the effect on the insects must have been still greater for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations which were not to be seen on the heath and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree nothing whatever else having been done with the exception that the land had been enclosed so that cattle could not enter but how important an element enclosure is i plainly saw near farnham in surrey here there are extensive heaths with a few clumps of old scotch firs on the distant hilltops within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed and selfsown firs are now springing up in multitudes so close together that all cannot live when i ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted i was so much surprised at their numbers that i went to several points of view whence i could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath and literally i could not see a single scotch fir except the old planted clumps but on looking closely between the stems of the heath i found a multitude of seedlings and little trees which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle in one square yard at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps i counted thirtytwo little trees and one of them judging from the rings of growth had during twentysix years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath and had failed no wonder that as soon as the land was enclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotch fir but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state and azara and rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born the increase of these flies numerous as they are must be habitually checked by some means probably by birds hence if certain insectivorous birds whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey were to increase in paraguay the flies would decreasethen cattle and horses would become feral and this would certainly greatly alter as indeed i have observed in parts of south america the vegetation this again would largely affect the insects and this as we just have seen in staffordshire the insectivorous birds and so onwards in everincreasing circles of complexity we began this series by insectivorous birds and we have ended with them not that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success and yet in the longrun the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another nevertheless so profound is our ignorance and so high our presumption that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being and as we do not see the cause we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life i am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals most remote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web of complex relations i shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic lobelia fulgens in this part of england is never visited by insects and consequently from its peculiar structure never can set a seed many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollenmasses and thus to fertilise them i have also reason to believe that humblebees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease viola tricolor for other bees do not visit this flower from experiments which i have tried i have found that the visits of bees if not indispensable are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers but humblebees alone visit the common red clover trifolium pratense as other bees cannot reach the nectar hence i have very little doubt that if the whole genus of humblebees became extinct or very rare in england the heartsease and red clover would become very rare or wholly disappear the number of humblebees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of fieldmice which destroy their combs and nests and mr h newman who has long attended to the habits of humblebees believes that more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england now the number of mice is largely dependent as every one knows on the number of cats and mr newman says near villages and small towns i have found the nests of humblebees more numerous than elsewhere which i attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine through the intervention first of mice and then of bees the frequency of certain flowers in that district in the case of every species many different checks acting at different periods of life and during different seasons or years probably come into play some one check or some few being generally the most potent but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of the species in some cases it can be shown that widelydifferent checks act on the same species in different districts when we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance but how false a view is this every one has heard that when an american forest is cut down a very different vegetation springs up but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient indian mounds in the southern united states display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests what a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand what war between insect and insectbetween insects snails and other animals with birds and beasts of preyall striving to increase and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees throw up a handful of feathers and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined in the course of centuries the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old indian ruins the dependency of one organic being on another as of a parasite on its prey lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature this is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence as in the case of locusts and grassfeeding quadrupeds but the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species for they frequent the same districts require the same food and are exposed to the same dangers in the case of varieties of the same species the struggle will generally be almost equally severe and we sometimes see the contest soon decided for instance if several varieties of wheat be sown together and the mixed seed be resown some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate or are naturally the most fertile will beat the others and so yield more seed and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties to keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweetpeas they must be each year harvested separately and the seed then mixed in due proportion otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear so again with the varieties of sheep it has been asserted that certain mountainvarieties will starve out other mountainvarieties so that they cannot be kept together the same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech it may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength habits and constitution that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations if they were allowed to struggle together like beings in a state of nature and if the seed or young were not annually sorted as species of the same genus have usually though by no means invariably some similarity in habits and constitution and always in structure the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus when they come into competition with each other than between species of distinct genera we see this in the recent extension over parts of the united states of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species the recent increase of the misselthrush in parts of scotland has caused the decrease of the songthrush how frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates in russia the small asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener one species of charlock will supplant another and so in other cases we can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life a corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks namely that the structure of every organic being is related in the most essential yet often hidden manner to that of all other organic beings with which it comes into competition for food or residence or from which it has to escape or on which it preys this is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tigers body but in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion and in the flattened and fringed legs of the waterbeetle the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground in the waterbeetle the structure of its legs so well adapted for diving allows it to compete with other aquatic insects to hunt for its own prey and to escape serving as prey to other animals the store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants but from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds as peas and beans when sown in the midst of long grass i suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around look at a plant in the midst of its range why does it not double or quadruple its numbers we know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold dampness or dryness for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder damper or drier districts in this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors or over the animals which preyed on it on the confines of its geographical range a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone not until we reach the extreme confines of life in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert will competition cease the land may be extremely cold or dry yet there will be competition between some few species or between the individuals of the same species for the warmest or dampest spots hence also we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner if we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies it is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another probably in no single instance should we know what to do so as to succeed it will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings a conviction as necessary as it seems to be difficult to acquire all that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio that each at some period of its life during some season of the year during each generation or at intervals has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction when we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant that no fear is felt that death is generally prompt and that the vigorous the healthy and the happy survive and multiply chapter iv natural selection natural selection its power compared with mans selection its power on characters of trifling importance its power at all ages and on both sexes sexual selection on the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection namely intercrossing isolation number of individuals slow action extinction caused by natural selection divergence of character related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation action of natural selection through divergence of character and extinction on the descendants from a common parent explains the grouping of all organic beings how will the struggle for existence discussed too briefly in the last chapter act in regard to variation can the principle of selection which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man apply in nature i think we shall see that it can act most effectually let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions and in a lesser degree those under nature vary and how strong the hereditary tendency is under domestication it may be truly said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and closefitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life can it then be thought improbable seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations if such do occur can we doubt remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive that individuals having any advantage however slight over others would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind on the other hand we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed this preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations i call natural selection variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection and would be left a fluctuating element as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic we shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change for instance of climate the proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change and some species might become extinct we may conclude from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants independently of the change of climate itself would most seriously affect many of the others if the country were open on its borders new forms would certainly immigrate and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be but in the case of an island or of a country partly surrounded by barriers into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified for had the area been open to immigration these same places would have been seized on by intruders in such case every slight modification which in the course of ages chanced to arise and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species by better adapting them to their altered conditions would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement we have reason to believe as stated in the first chapter that a change in the conditions of life by specially acting on the reproductive system causes or increases variability and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring and unless profitable variations do occur natural selection can do nothing not that as i believe any extreme amount of variability is necessary as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences so could nature but far more easily from having incomparably longer time at her disposal nor do i believe that any great physical change as of climate or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants for as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage no country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live that none of them could anyhow be improved for in all countries the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land and as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage so as to have better resisted such intruders as man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection what may not nature effect man can act only on external and visible characters nature cares nothing for appearances except in so far as they may be useful to any being she can act on every internal organ on every shade of constitutional difference on the whole machinery of life man selects only for his own good nature only for that of the being which she tends every selected character is fully exercised by her and the being is placed under wellsuited conditions of life man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food he does not exercise a longbacked or longlegged quadruped in any peculiar manner he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate he does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals but protects during each varying season as far as lies in his power all his productions he often begins his selection by some halfmonstrous form or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye or to be plainly useful to him under nature the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicelybalanced scale in the struggle for life and so be preserved how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man how short his time and consequently how poor will his products be compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods can we wonder then that natures productions should be far truer in character than mans productions that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship it may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good silently and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life we see nothing of these slow changes in progress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being yet characters and structures which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance may thus be acted on when we see leafeating insects green and barkfeeders mottledgrey the alpine ptarmigan white in winter the redgrouse the colour of heather and the blackgrouse that of peaty earth we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger grouse if not destroyed at some period of their lives would increase in countless numbers they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey and hawks are guided by eyesight to their preyso much so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons as being the most liable to destruction hence i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse and in keeping that colour when once acquired true and constant nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black in plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist downing that in the united states smoothskinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle a curculio than those with down that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums whereas another disease attacks yellowfleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh if with all the aids of art these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties assuredly in a state of nature where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies such differences would effectually settle which variety whether a smooth or downy a yellow or purple fleshed fruit should succeed in looking at many small points of difference between species which as far as our ignorance permits us to judge seem to be quite unimportant we must not forget that climate food c probably produce some slight and direct effect it is however far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth which when one part of the organisation is modified through variation and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being will cause other modifications often of the most unexpected nature as we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at the same periodfor instance in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm in the eggs of poultry and in the colour of the down of their chickens in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adultso in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age and by their inheritance at a corresponding age if it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind i can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection than in the cottonplanter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cottontrees natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies wholly different from those which concern the mature insect these modifications will no doubt affect through the laws of correlation the structure of the adult and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours and which never feed a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvæ so conversely modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life shall not be in the least degree injurious for if they became so they would cause the extinction of the species natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent and of the parent in relation to the young in social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community if each in consequence profits by the selected change what natural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of one species without giving it any advantage for the good of another species and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history i cannot find one case which will bear investigation a structure used only once in an animals whole life if of high importance to it might be modified to any extent by natural selection for instance the great jaws possessed by certain insects and used exclusively for opening the cocoonor the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds used for breaking the egg it has been asserted that of the best shortbeaked tumblerpigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching now if nature had to make the beak of a fullgrown pigeon very short for the birds own advantage the process of modification would be very slow and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg which had the most powerful and hardest beaks for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish or more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure sexual selectioninasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex the same fact probably occurs under nature and if so natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes as is sometimes the case with insects and this leads me to say a few words on what i call sexual selection this depends not on a struggle for existence but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring sexual selection is therefore less rigorous than natural selection generally the most vigorous males those which are best fitted for their places in nature will leave most progeny but in many cases victory will depend not on general vigour but on having special weapons confined to the male sex a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage length to the spur and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg as well as the brutal cockfighter who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks how low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends i know not male alligators have been described as fighting bellowing and whirling round like indians in a wardance for the possession of the females male salmons have been seen fighting all day long male stagbeetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males the war is perhaps severest between the males of polygamous animals and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons the males of carnivorous animals are already well armed though to them and to others special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection as the mane to the lion the shoulderpad to the boar and the hooked jaw to the male salmon for the shield may be as important for victory as the sword or spear amongst birds the contest is often of a more peaceful character all those who have attended to the subject believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females the rockthrush of guiana birds of paradise and some others congregate and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females which standing by as spectators at last choose the most attractive partner those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes thus sir r heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds it may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means i cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams according to his standard of beauty i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds by selecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful males according to their standard of beauty might produce a marked effect i strongly suspect that some wellknown laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds in comparison with the plumage of the young can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons either by the males alone or by the males and females but i have not space here to enter on this subject thus it is as i believe that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life but differ in structure colour or ornament such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection that is individual males have had in successive generations some slight advantage over other males in their weapons means of defence or charms and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring yet i would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals as the wattle in male carriers hornlike protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls c which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle or attractive to the females we see analogous cases under nature for instance the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkeycock which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this birdindeed had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been called a monstrosity illustrations of the action of natural selectionin order to make it clear how as i believe natural selection acts i must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations let us take the case of a wolf which preys on various animals securing some by craft some by strength and some by fleetness and let us suppose that the fleetest prey a deer for instance had from any change in the country increased in numbers or that other prey had decreased in numbers during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food i can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving and so be preserved or selectedprovided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year when they might be compelled to prey on other animals i can see no more reason to doubt this than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey nor can this be thought very improbable for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals one cat for instance taking to catch rats another mice one cat according to mr st john bringing home winged game another hares or rabbits and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes the tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited now if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure and by the repetition of this process a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parentform of wolf or again the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district and those frequenting the lowlands would naturally be forced to hunt different prey and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites two varieties might slowly be formed these varieties would cross and blend where they met but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return i may add that according to mr pierce there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the united states one with a light greyhoundlike form which pursues deer and the other more bulky with shorter legs which more frequently attacks the shepherds flocks let us now take a more complex case certain plants excrete a sweet juice apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some leguminosæ and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel this juice though small in quantity is greedily sought by insects let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower in this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower the flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed and the act of crossing we have good reason to believe as will hereafter be more fully alluded to would produce very vigorous seedlings which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectarexcreting power those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries and which excreted most nectar would be oftenest visited by insects and would be oftenest crossed and so in the longrun would gain the upper hand those flowers also which had their stamens and pistils placed in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower would likewise be favoured or selected we might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant yet if a little pollen were carried at first occasionally and then habitually by the pollendevouring insects from flower to flower and a cross thus effected although ninetenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant and those individuals which produced more and more pollen and had larger and larger anthers would be selected when our plant by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers had been rendered highly attractive to insects they would unintentionally on their part regularly carry pollen from flower to flower and that they can most effectually do this i could easily show by many striking instances i will give only onenot as a very striking case but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants presently to be alluded to some hollytrees bear only male flowers which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen and a rudimentary pistil other hollytrees bear only female flowers these have a fullsized pistil and four stamens with shrivelled anthers in which not a grain of pollen can be detected having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree i put the stigmas of twenty flowers taken from different branches under the microscope and on all without exception there were pollengrains and on some a profusion of pollen as the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree the pollen could not thus have been carried the weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees nevertheless every female flower which i examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees accidentally dusted with pollen having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar but to return to our imaginary case as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower another process might commence no naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the physiological division of labour hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant in plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour individuals with this tendency more and more increased would be continually favoured or selected until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected let us now turn to the nectarfeeding insects in our imaginary case we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection to be a common plant and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food i could give many facts showing how anxious bees are to save time for instance their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers which they can with a very little more trouble enter by the mouth bearing such facts in mind i can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body or in the curvature and length of the proboscis c far too slight to be appreciated by us might profit a bee or other insect so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure the tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers trifolium pratense and incarnatum do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length yet the hivebee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover but not out of the common red clover which is visited by humblebees alone so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hivebee thus it might be a great advantage to the hivebee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis on the other hand i have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface hence again if humblebees were to become rare in any country it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla so that the hivebee could visit its flowers thus i can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become either simultaneously or one after the other modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure i am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection exemplified in the above imaginary instances is open to the same objections which were at first urged against sir charles lyells noble views on the modern changes of the earth as illustrative of geology but we now very seldom hear the action for instance of the coastwaves called a trifling and insignificant cause when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications each profitable to the preserved being and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave so will natural selection if it be a true principle banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings or of any great and sudden modification in their structure on the intercrossing of individualsi must here introduce a short digression in the case of animals and plants with separated sexes it is of course obvious that two individuals must always unite for each birth but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious nevertheless i am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals either occasionally or habitually concur for the reproduction of their kind this view i may add was first suggested by andrew knight we shall presently see its importance but i must here treat the subject with extreme brevity though i have the materials prepared for an ample discussion all vertebrate animals all insects and some other large groups of animals pair for each birth modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair that is two individuals regularly unite for reproduction which is all that concerns us but still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites what reason it may be asked is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction as it is impossible here to enter on details i must trust to some general considerations alone in the first place i have collected so large a body of facts showing in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain gives vigour and fertility to the offspring and on the other hand that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law that no organic being selffertilises itself for an eternity of generations but that a cross with another individual is occasionallyperhaps at very long intervalsindispensable on the belief that this is a law of nature we can i think understand several large classes of facts such as the following which on any other view are inexplicable every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather but if an occasional cross be indispensable the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure more especially as the plants own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that selffertilisation seems almost inevitable many flowers on the other hand have their organs of fructification closely enclosed as in the great papilionaceous or peafamily but in several perhaps in all such flowers there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar for in doing this they either push the flowers own pollen on the stigma or bring pollen from another flower so necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers that i have found by experiments published elsewhere that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented now it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower and not carry pollen from one to the other to the great good as i believe
