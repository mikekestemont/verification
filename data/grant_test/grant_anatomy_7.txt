the lengthened form and feebleness of the extensors of their posterior extremities as the glutei muscles the recti femor is the vasti the gastrocnemii and other extensors so large in the human body produce that smallness of the nates the thighs and the calfs so charac teristic of this climbing frugivorous order the muscles of the jaws and of the neck are strongest in the baboons where the trunk is most adapted for the horizontal posture and the ferocity and general strength are almost those of carnivora the flexors of the coccygeal vertebrae are most powerful in the long prehensile tail of the aides or spider monkeys of america in which the long recti abdominis are still destitute of tendinous intersections as in many of the inferior mammalia from the vertical position of the human trunk on the posterior extremities and the freedom and flexibility of the arms the extensor muscles are most deve loped on the legs and the flexors on the arms the muscles also which support and move the spine and those which embrace the visceral cavities are proportionally strong in man fig the numerous flexors of the toes are here powerful to enable the foot to sustain the weight of the whole body in progression and this organ is strengthened by its shortness and by the fixed condition of its solid parts the gastrocnemii b k i are large and the tendo achilles b m is thick and strong to raise the heel and the whole trunk in walking and to preserve the tibia in a vertical position on the astragalus in standing for the same reason the rectus femoris a n and the vastus exturnus j a nf and interims a wf are large and fleshy to preserve the femur erect upon the tibia and the glutei muscles b are of great magnitude to preserve the pelvis and trunk vertical upon the femur hence the magnitude and rotun dity of the calfs the thighs and the nates so characteristic of the human form the trapezius b the latissimus dorsi b c the rhomboidei serrati sacrolumbalis multi fidus spiny and most of the muscles of the back or extensors of the spine are proportioned to the great weight which they have to sustain in the movements of the trunk the flexor muscles of the anklejoint and those of the knee and of the thigh are generally thin lengthened and feeble compared with the extensors of these joints or when compared with their development in many of the inferior mammalia the obliqui and the transversalis abdominis here form strong muscular parietes for the support of the heavy abdominal viscera the recti abdominis are unusually short and thick in man and divided by distinct transverse tendinous intersec tions and the small pyramidales are more constant than in quadrupeds the articulation of the head of the humerus is adapted for free and varied rather than for powerful move ments and the pectorales a b the deltoid a e and the scapular muscles are short broad and of moderate strength but the biceps brachii af the flexor carpi radialis a and ulnaris the supinator radii longus a h the pronator radii teres a i and almost all the other flexors of the forearm and those of the fingers are much more developed than the extensors of the same joint so that while these extremities are unfit for supporting the trunk in a horizontal position they have the form and movements best adapted for seizing or feeling outward ob jects for manipulating the young and for the various uses to which they are applied in social intercourse and in the arts the great weight of the head and its vertical position unsupported by a ligamentum nuchee require the recti and obliqui capitis the splenius complexus and trachelomastoi deusy the platisma myoides a c the sternocleidomas toideusy and nearly all the other muscles of the neck to be proportionally strong for the support and movement of that heavy part the teeth having little resistance to overcome by the general softness of the food the temporal and mas seter muscles are of moderate size and by the shortness of the jaws the ordinary muscles of the face are confined to a smaller extent of surface than in other mammalia and their actions consequently produce impressions more numerous and diversified and which are more visible from the nakedness the softness and the generally light colour of the human skin the moveable parts of the face into which the muscles are chiefly inserted are the lips and the eyebrows from the re lation of these parts to food to speech and to visual impres sions and as the motions of those parts are regulated by present sensations and are associated with corresponding conditions of the mind they are the chief seats of human expression in which we read the transient feelings of the moment or the habitual tendency of the passions or the in ward workings of the soul chapter fourth nervous system or organs of sensibility and motility first section general observations on the nervous system the nervous system communicates to the muscles their energy of action and to all the sentient parts of the body their power of feeling by the rapidity of its action and its extensive distribution through the body it establishes an in stantaneous communication between the most distant parts it is chiefly by this system that animals are connected with surrounding nature and there is no part of their economy which is more indicative than this of the condition of the whole organization or of the grade which an animal occupies in the scale the nervous system has been detected in every division of the animal kingdom and almost in every class and it is everywhere connected with sensation and motion its general form corresponds with that of the body being short and disposed in a circular manner in the short round bodies of most of the radiated and molluscous animals and having a narrow and extended form in the more lengthened trunks of the articulated animals and the vertebrata the great cen tral portion of the nervous system is perforated by the ali mentary canal in the invertebrated classes either in its mid dle as in the radiata and the mollusca or at its anterior ex tremity as in the articulata but in the vertebrata the spi nocerebral axis lies wholly above the digestive cavity by which it is nowhere pierced the nerves of sensation and motion closely accompany each other forming by their union chords or columns or a spinocerebral axis but the sympathetic nerves appropriated to the more slow and re gular movements of organic life form a more isolated sys tem and these three systems are developed together almost from the lowest animals the nervous system consists of very fine tubular filaments generally containing white coloured opaque particles much smaller than the globules of the blood these minute fibres do not ramify like blood vessels but continue uninterrupted from their peripheral ex tremity in the textures of the organs to their proximal end in the cineritious substance of ganglia or of the brain the cineritious or cortical matter is composed of a vascular plexus in the meshes of which is an irregular granular pulp and the fibrous arrangement becomes more obvious and regular at its junction with the white medullary portion in the white portion of the brain and in the nerves of the prin cipal senses the ultimate component tubular filaments have a knotted or beaded appearance from their numerous small dilations and they appear to be empty or to contain only a transparent homogenous fluid as seen in the annexed figure of ehrenberg fig where a is a magnified view of the knotted fibres composing the white matter of the hu man brain b represents the coarser beaded fibres composing the human auditory nerve and c exhibits those of the hu man optic nerve this structure is observed on pressing fine sections of these parts between plates of mica or of glass and viewing them through the microscope this knotted structure of the minute filaments is seen also in the olfactory nerve and in the sympathetic the ordinary sym metrical nerves of sensation and of motion throughout the body are composed of tubular filaments of more equal calibre throughout their course and which are filled with minute white globular particles as seen in those of the hu man facial nerve fig d where the globular minute par ticles filling the neurilematous tubes are seen escaping from the cut ends of the filaments this knotted appearance of the cerebral and sensitive filaments has been considered by some as resulting from the external aggregation of clusters of minute particles along the surface of chains of similar globules composing the ultimate nervous fibrils these ex tremely minute fibrils variously aggregated together by en veloping sheaths of condensed cellular tissue but without anywhere anastomosing constitute the nerves of sensation and of motion throughout the animal kingdom and the spinocerebral axis of the vertebrata the nervous system is developed like other organs of the body from the periphery to the centre and it presents great uniformity of plan in its adult conditions in the inferior classes and in its transient embryoforms throughout all the higher orders of animals nervous system of the cycloneurose or radiated classes many of the poly gastric animalcules as the cercarite are distinctly sensitive to light and organs of vision in form of minute red points are seen in almost every genus they appear also to possess an acute sense of taste they distin guish pursue and seize their prey they avoid impinging on each other while swimming crowded in myriads in a drop of water they contract and bend their body in every direction and they increase or retard or cease at pleasure their progressive motion and the vibration of their cilia like the muscular and gangliated rotiferous animalcules yet nervous filaments have not been distinctly detected in the minute transparent bodies of the polygastrica the numerous straight parallel jaws seen in many of the genera are opened and closed advanced and retracted with great quickness and precision and all the movements of these minute animals appear to be as regular methodical spontaneous and welldirected as those of many higher animals with obvious nerves the transparency of the nervous filaments in all the minute forms of animals probably prevents our detecting in the polygastrica the rudi ment of that form of the nervous system which is seen in the wheelanimalcules and in the higher articulated classes in the poriphera the component particles of the nervous and muscular systems are probably diffused through every part of the soft cellular tissue of the body which possesses the same living properties in every part and is almost inde finitely divisible without destroying its vitality the repro ductive gemmules of these animals vibrate their cilia with great regularity and force they appear to be conscious of each others approach and can accelerate retard or cease their motions at pleasure they are sensitive to light and appear to be guided by its influence in selecting the place of attachment most suited for the growth of each species yet they exhibit no nervous or muscular filament in the gela tinous texture of their body many polypipherous animals even of the simplest forms are obviously sensitive to light as hydra lobularite actiniae and muscular fibres are distinctly perceptible in the polypi and other parts of most of the higher genera the nervous system has been long known in the actinia which is a large isolated naked polypus closely resembling in external form and internal structure the po lypi of caryophillice pavonite and many of the larger litho phytes nervous filaments surround the muscular foot of the actinia beneath the stomach and present minute gan glia in their course from which nerves pass out to the cir cumference and to the muscular folds which here possess great power of contraction the same system probably ex ists in many other closely allied forms of polypi the lowest ciliograde acalepha possess great activity are provided with numerous long tentacula exquisitely sensitive and contractile exhibit distinct internal organs for digestion circulation and generation and are found to be provided with nervous fila ments and even ganglia around the oesophagus in the beroe pileus fig a the nervous system is disposed around the mouth at the lower extremity of the body in form of a double filament a with eight small white ganglia b inter posed between the eight longitudinal bands of cilia from each of these gang lia a small filament proceeds upwards in a longitudinal direction c towards the anal extremity of the body and others pass out laterally and downwards to the projecting irritable lips surround ing the mouth in the medusos a ner vous band accompanying the marginal circular continuation of the alimentary cavity is disposed around the irritable border of the mantle with minute gan glia placed near the bases of the marginal tentacula from each of these ganglia nervous filaments proceed to the near est tentacula along the bases of which they can be traced eight optic ganglia are perceived at the bases of the eight ocular peduncles from which nerves proceed to the small red coloured marginal eyes which they are observed to en ter other ganglia are also perceived near the ovaries around the entrance to the stomach from which nervous filaments are seen passing downwards to the central groups of tentacula from each optic ganglion two nerves proceed which unite by a kind of decussation before they enter the eye the eye is provided with a distinct crystalline lens and the pigment is redcoloured like that of most of the simplest forms of this organ from the active movements of most acalepha in swimming through the sea from their gregareous habits the exquisite sensibility and contractility of their ten tacula the distinct development of their muscular fibres and their perception of light it is not likely that many are desti tute of some form of this system so general in its occurrence and so influential in the economy the echinoderma like the acalepha are all inhabitants of the sea and as in other aquatic animals they present a de velopment of the muscular and nervous systems and of all the other organs of relation inferior to that of animals of a corresponding grade inhabiting the land their nervous fila ments are also less white and opaque less firm in texture and less obvious than in the land animals the distribution of the nervous system has been long known in several ge nera of this class and it presents the same circular disposi tion as in the acalepha and other cycloneurose animals in the asterias fig b which has but one opening of the alimentary cavity e there is a small white opaque nervous chord passing round the mouth from this circular chord a nerve c c is given off to each of the radiating di visions of the body which passes along the middle of the lower parietes between the ambulacra and gives filaments to the muscular suckers and other parts of the rays mi nute ganglia b are observed at the points where these ra diating nerves originate and from each of these ganglia two nerves d extend obliquely upwards along the sides of the stomach and are confined in their distribution chiefly to the parts contained within the central disk of the body a similar nervous chord is seen around the oesophagus of the echinus which sends delicate white filaments to the compli cated muscular and sensitive apparatus of the mouth other nerves are seen extending upwards from the same oesophageal ring along the course of the vessels in the interior of the ab dominal cavity in the holothuria where the axis of the body is greatly lengthened and the animal reclines and moves on one side of the trunk like the higher classes where the calcareous shell is wanting and the muscular sys tem is most distinct and powerful the nervous system is extensively distributed and begins to manifest an approach to the helminthoid type interior to the osseous apparatus of the mouth is a white nervous ring around the oesophagus from which nerves pass outwards to the large ramified ten tacula around the mouth and others extend upwards along the course of the eight strong longitudinal muscular bands fine white filaments are likewise seen passing inwards to the stomach and alimentary apparatus in the siponculus which is closely allied to the holothuria in internal structure and living habits but is much more lengthened and vermiform in out ward shape two of the minute longitudinal nervous filaments extending backwards from the cesophageal ring are developed only on one side of the body like the abdominal nerves in the helminthoid articulata thus in all the typical forms of this extensive class the nervous columns of motion and sen sation are seen to form a collar around the entrance of the alimentary canal which corresponds with the inverted posi tion of the mouth and the expanded globular or radiated form of the body around a short vertical axis the length ening of the axis in the soft naked apodal vermiform species of echinoderma necessitates a horizontal position of the trunk and the nerves yet unprotected by an osseous sheath are for safety continued only along the inferior surface of the body this introduces the distinction of dorsal and ventral surface of the trunk unknown in the inferior tribes of radiata where the parts are equally developed around a central axis and where the nervous system presents the same peripheral development third section nervous system of the diploneurose or articulated classes in the long cylindrical trunks of the helminthoid and en tomoid classes the nervous system partakes of the same lengthened form and its motor and sensitive columns are ex tended for protection along the ventral or under surface of the body this system is still contained in the same rings or segments which envelop the other viscera of the trunk in all the vermiform articulata where the articulated members are scarcely developed from the sides but in the highest entomoid animals of this great division the nervous columns are inclosed in a distinct thoracic osseous canal separate from that which contains the other organs and in all these classes the motor and sensitive columns appear to me to occupy the same inverted position with relation to the spinocerebral axis of vertebrata as that first shown by lyonet in insects the motor columns always lie above and in contact with the gan glionic as shown by him in the cossus fig a b c all the other viscera of the trunk present the same inverted po sition the heartforming portion of the sanguiferous system occupies the dorsal surface and the great nervous columns the ventral surface of the alimentary canal in the articulated classes the position of these organs and of the whole trunk and consequently the nervous columns is reversed in the spini cerebrata where the great centres of the nervous system are inclosed in a distinct osseous sheath in the lowest of the helminthoid classes the entozoa where the animals remain for the most part permanently im bedded in the source of their nutrition the nervous system is very imperfectly developed and is little required the more elevated forms of nematoid intestinal worms as the ascaris fig a present a slender double white nervous filament occupying the median line of the abdomen and placed immediately within the inner longitudinal muscular tunic this abdominal nervous chord in the long cylindrical body of the nematoid worms appears from the close approx imation and the smallness of its component parts to consist of a single filament but it unravels its compound structure chiefly in two places of its course where it meets with the vulva of the female and separates its columns to embrace that orifice fig a and where it separates at the an terior extremity of the trunk to encompass the resophagus fig a a these nervous columns are more obvious on the large strongyli and echinorhynchi where they present a similar form and distribution their anterior extremities generally ascend on each side of the resophagus so as to em brace that canal more or less completely with a nervous collar the surface of the body along which the nervous columns run in these animals and in all the other articu lated classes is termed the ventral surface from its being the inferior in the ordinary position of the body and from the anus and other excretory orifices opening on that aspect of the trunk the anus the valva and the penis are placed on this surface in the entozoa this simple form of the ner vous system presented by the lowest articulated class re sembles the embryo form of this system in the higher classes of this division and corresponds remarkably with the first perceptible form of the spinocerebral axis in ah the verte brated animals where it appears a double white streak on the outer layer of the germinal portion of the cicatricula these simple worms consisting solely of the trunk present also the embryoform of the whole body of the highest articulated classes in the higher animals of this class the epizoa which adhere to some part of the external surface of aquatic animals as in the achtheres and many others the nervous system is more developed and these animals generally possess rudimentary antennae and even eyes they have the two longitudinal nervous chords running separately and at some distance from each other separated by the whole breadth of the alimentary canal from the want of organs of sense on the anterior extremity of the body in most of the entozoa the nervous system is very imperfectly deve loped in that direction and although it often forms a ring around the ossophagus it seldom forms a perceptible supra cesophageal ganglion where these filaments meet in the rotiferous animals where there is a complex mus cular apparatus at the anterior extremity of the trunk for the motion of the numerous large cilia and another muscular apparatus for the movements of the strong lateral maxillae the nervous system is most developed in that part of the body there is generally in these wheelanimalcules as in the hydatina fig b a distinct supraoesophageal gan glion a with smaller lateral ganglia b c surrounding the entrance of the alimentary canal e and from the anterior or inferior ganglia c c proceed the nervous columns back wards along the ventral surface of the trunk d these ab dominal nervous columns as in the entozoa are sometimes approximated to each other and without perceptible ganglia in their course and in others they are separated to a greater or less distance from each other and have numerous ganglia developed along their sensitive columns in the hydatina the longitudinal nervous columns are united b d and without apparent ganglia below the alimentary canal in the diglena lacustris the nervous columns are a little separated from each other and present only one pair of ganglia imme diately below the oesophagus and another pair below the pyloric extremity of the stomach the longitudinal ventral columns are much more separated from each other in their whole course in the notommata clavulata and each of these lateral chords presents nine perceptible ganglia in its course backwards to the posterior extremity of the trunk these abdominal ganglia are symmetrically disposed in pairs though removed laterally to a distance from each other on the inferior part of the trunk the nervous system of the cirrhopods fig c is symmetrically disposed in approximated columns b c along the abdominal surface of the trunk with parallel pairs of ganglia regularly developed along their course as in all the higher articulated classes in the anitifa fig c we perceive a slender white nervous ring surrounding the oesophagus a and sending out small filaments to the neigh bouring parts but scarcely forming a perceptible supra ossophageal ganglion from the imperfect development of the sensitive and masticating apparatus in these fixed and in verted testaceous or entomostracous animals as the long jointed and ciliated feet with their thick muscular haunches and supporting the branchiee at their base are developed from the sides of the posterior part of the trunk the ganglia like the nervous columns which connect them are large in that part of the body and correspond in position with the origin of the several pairs of legs b c d e so that these animals notwithstanding their molluscous exterior fixed in a multivalve shell lined by a fleshy mantle are con nected with the articulated classes by the diploneurose cha racter of their nervous system and by all their other organs of relation the annelida present as great diversities in the extent of development of their nervous system as in their exterior forms and their whole internal organization in the minute transparent bodies of the planaria and in many of the simplest forms of aquatic worms scarcely a trace of nervous columns can be perceived although their organs of vision are often numerous and obvious and even in the naids and some of the nereids the nervous chord along the middle of the ven tral surface of the trunk appears as uniform and simple as in the nematoid entozoa the columns in the simpler anne lides as in the first larva state of the higher entomoid classes scarcely present ganglionic enlargements in their course along the abdomen or supracesophageal ganglia at their anterior extremity from the general inferiority of their organization and from the still imperfect development of their lateral appendices for progressive motion and of their cephalic appendices for sensation or mastication in the long cylindrical and muscular bodies of the airbreathing earthworms fig d with their myriad of short and highly moveable segments their exquisitely sensitive skin and their minute rudimentary feet we can perceive innumer able mixed nerves fig d b proceeding laterally from the closely approximated nervous columns but scarcely a ganglionic enlargement is developed in their long and equal course along the ventral surface of the trunk in this highest of the helminthoid classes the nervous columns are still entirely enclosed in the cyclovertebral elements along with all the other viscera of the abdominal cavity the abdominal chords of the earthworm embrace the oesophagus at their anterior extremity and form two distinct cephalic or supraaesophageal ganglia fig d a which supply nerves to the large muscular apparatus of the mouth and to the long dorsal sympathetic these two cephalic ganglia lie in contact with each other are lengthened transversely like those of insects appear greycoloured on the surface and more white internally and seem to be composed of minute globules when examined under the microscope the sympathetics are distinct along the aorta in the nereides and the globular par ticles are seen in their neurilema the ventral columns are separate from each other in the sabelke where the body of the annelides is much developed transversely as in the leech the seamouse the pectinaria and many others the ganglia along the columns and the columns themselves are much more developed and distinct and are visible at a much earlier period in the embryo the abdominal ganglia of the leech as shown by weber are quite obvious in the embryo of that worm while it is yet in the ovum where the setae for progressive motion are large numerous and moved by strong extensor and retractor muscles as in the pleione and many of the tubicolous anne lides the nervous columns and their ganglia are also large and distinct the motor and sensitive nerves come generally from the same parts of the columns the distribution of the minutest filaments are seen without dissection through the transparent and colourless body of the common pectinaria and in most annelides the abdominal columns and ganglia of a white colour and firm consistence are obvious to the naked eye through the thin parietes beneath them in some of the broad naked apodal annelides where the segments of the body are very numerous and short to facilitate their ser pentine movements as in the leech the abdominal ganglia could not be safely accommodated in every ring of the trunk and we find but one ganglion of considerable size for every three or four segments these abdominal ganglia about twen tyfive in the leech are more closely approximated to each other at the two ends of the nervous columns than in the middle which already indicates the commencement of that longitudinal concentration of the ganglia so remarkable in the higher articulata as the almost constant approximation of the lateral columns themselves on the median plain of the abdomen indicates development in a transverse direction and a higher grade of this system than the detached condition of the columns seen in the lowest helminthoid animals the nervous system of the entomoid classes presents only a more developed condition of the same plan of structure presented by this system in the worms and that of the most elevated insect or crab begins its development with the simplest helminthoid form as the nervous system of man passes through the simplest grades of that system presented by the lowest fishes the larva of the insect like the red blooded worm is almost a simple cylinder soft flexible smooth and equal throughout and the nervous columns then manifest the same equal development from one extre tremity of the body to the other the most helminthoid adult form of the whole body presented by the entomoid classes is that of the long equally developed myriapods and the simplicity of their outward form is accompanied with a corresponding inferiority in the type of their nervous system and of all their internal organs their nervous system is nearly that of the annelida and the larva but as their con solidated segments develop stronger muscular members to support them on the land their nervous columns and gan glia are encreased in size to afford additional nerves to those enlarged extremities on looking through the abdominal nervous columns of the scolopendra we can distinctly per ceive notwithstanding the transverse approximation of all the parts a distinct transparent line marking the original sepa ration of most of the united ganglia the globular cineritious particles composing the ganglia appear often united to form a round isolated mass in the centre of the ganglia and the same opaque particles when coagulated are seen to occupy in an interrupted manner the interior of the sensitive columns the motor columns i have found here of great size as those shown by treviranus and by muller in the equally muscular body of the scorpion the ganglia like the segments are nearly equally developed and equidistant from one extremity of the chord to the other excepting the first pair or supracesophageal which give nerves to the long antennae and to the large eyes and the remarkably small round terminal ganglion below the anus the intermediate trans verse motor nerves pointed out as respiratory nerves by lyonet in the columns of insects and by morren in the annelides do not here come off as they do in the earthworm midway be tween the ganglia but very close behind the ganglionic nerves four great nervous trunks originate from the columns on each side at each ganglion and the second anterior of these branches which is the largest proceeds to the muscles of the legs where i have traced it as far as the tarsal joint only two branches on each side proceed from the ganglionic space of the columns in the earthworm and one branch from each side in the middle of the interganglionic space the sympa thetic and its ganglia are here extremely minute as in the anne lides from the lengthened straight and narrow form of all the nutritive organs the second ganglion or first subeesophageal pair has a very lengthened form and its nerves proceed back wards at a very acute angle to escape from the large and long cephalic segment of the scolopendra the nerves from the ganglia i have observed more yellow and opaque than the trans parent and colourless filaments from the motor columns as if some of the cineritious globules of the ganglia were continued into the sensitive portions of the mixed nerves the great toughness and density of the neurilema which envelopes the nerves of the myriapods and insects which breathe atmospheric air is seen by the stiffness with which the most delicate and lengthened filaments project right out wards in a radiating manner from around all the ganglia the nervous filaments are much softer in the crustacea mollusca and other aquatic animals and the same difference is ob served in the density of their muscular fibres from the great size of the motor columns in the scolopendra there is a distinct lateral longitudinal groove of separation between them and the inferior or sensitive chords and on seizing the fourth or last pair of nerves from each ganglionic space and raising them upwards the large motor columns i have found to be nearly as easily separable from the sensitive beneath them as those which i have demonstrated for many years past as the motor columns of the scorpion fig b a g and which have more recently been imagined to be res piratory nerves in the muscular tail of that pulmonated animal the abdominal nervous columns of insects have been cor rectly regarded by lyonet straus dufour chiaje and most others as analogous to the spinocerebral axis of vertebrata and the first of these writers has described them seventy years ago as similar in anatomical structure and physiological proper ties to the spinal chord of the highest animals there are gene rally at first thirteen pairs of approximated ganglia correspond ing with the original segmentsand extended along the middle of the ventral surface of the body as shown by lyonet in the caterpillar of the cossus and the oesophagus passes downwards to perforate the connecting nervous columns between the first and second pairs of ganglia as in other articulated clas ses so that the first pair only are supraoesophageal or ce phalic and all the succeeding ganglia of the columns are be neath the alimentary canal those ganglia are at first like those of the worm and the centiped nearly at equal distances and of equal size as the segments themselves of the young caterpillar the columns and the ganglia originally separate on the two sides early approximate transversely and unite and a slow movement of the ganglionic matter is at length observed in a longitudinal direction to the parts of the columns where it is most required in the adult condition of the spe cies these transverse and longitudinal movements of the nervous matter so accurately described by herold in the spinal columns of insects proceed to a very variable extent according to the degree of metamorphosis from the larva state to which the whole body is subjected in the different adult forms of this class as in the myriapods the first and second pairs of ganglia are here contained within the head and the succeeding pairs are generally placed near the ante rior limit of the segments to which they belong the osso phageal ring thus formed by the columns between the two first or anterior pairs of ganglia is much wider during the voracious larva state of the insects than in their adult con dition see fig a b c the third pair of ganglia placed in the prothorax appear to be generally smaller than the fourth and the fifth in the metathorax smaller than the sixth as in the cossus the ganglia contained in the abdo men of the entomoid classes like the segments of that part of the trunk are generally the least altered by develop ment from their primitive condition but these are most changed in insects and are often obliterated by the process of development as shown by straus in the coleopterous in sects see fig d and by dufour in many of the hemip tera the last pair of ganglia are generally the first to ad vance forward to unite with the penultimate pair in the larva state in the annexed figures fig a b c are seen the common conditions of the nervous system in the larva the pupa and the imago state and the changes produced in that system by the metamorphosis to the perfect state as observed and described by herold twenty years ago in the papilio brassicas in the larva of that lepidopterous insect fig a the columns are lengthened the ganglia widely separated and nearly equal with a large ring between the ce phalic and the first infraoesophageal ganglia the first or cephalic ganglia a were observed by lyonet to give off eight pairs of nerves which pass chiefly to the organs of the senses besides the two columns which connect them with the second pair of ganglia a they give off like wise filaments to the small lateral ganglia a b of the head and to the commencement of the sympathetic series of ganglia a as shown by lyonet in the cossus between all the succeeding pairs of ganglia a solitary branch is seen coming off from each side of the motor column which inter ganglionic nerves were shown bv lyonet to be distributed on the muscles and the minutest ramifications of tracheae for respiration these interganglionic nerves come off ge nerally at a greater distance from the ganglia in insects and crustacea and in worms than in the myriapods and the arachnida the last pair a of ganglia are already ap proached to those which precede them a in the pupa state of this moth fig b the approximation of the segments has not only shortened the total length of the co lumns but has caused them to assume a puckered or curved appearance where they lie free between the ganglia the shortening of the whole trunk during the metamorphosis thus obviously takes place more quickly than the correspond ing changes of the nervous system the oesophageal ring is diminished the cephalic ganglia are enlarging and extend ing transversely for the myriad of developing eyes and the thoracic pairs of ganglia are approaching to each other pre paratory to their uniting together at the part best suited to send nerves to the yet undeveloped thoracic members the third pair of ganglia often advance to unite closely with the second pair the fifth to unite with the fourth pair and the seventh pair to unite with the sixth during the passage to the imago state and several or the whole of the ganglia which succeed these in the cavity of the abdomen entirely disappear while the motor and sensitive nerves still con tinue to come off from the same parts of the columns as seen in the nerves of the perfect insect fig c in the imago or perfect state of the insect fig c the loose interganglionic portions of the columns which were zigzag in the pupa have assumed a straight and shorter form the two last pairs have coalesced into one ganglion and advanced from their original position the cine ritious matter has disappeared from two pairs of the abdo minal ganglia without affecting the original origins of their nerves four pairs of ganglia have coalesced at two points of the thorax to supply nerves to the muscles of the legs and wings the second and first pairs of ganglia have approached in the head and diminished the dia meter of the oesophageal ring the cephalic ganglia c have enlarged and extended transversely to form the ex panded optic lobe in each orbit and the accessary nerves jc b b and the great sympathetic c a running back ward in the median plain above the alimentary canal have assumed an encreased development as shown by lyonet and straus and thus more intimately united all the seg ments and parts of the body by encreasing these bonds of connexion between all the organs and functions of vegetative or organic life the same kind of change in the whole condition of the nervous system effected by the metamor phosis of the insect is seen in straus figure of the adult or imago state of that system in themelolontha vulgaris fig d where the usual concentration of the nervous matter in the head and thorax has proceeded to a greater extent than in the papilio the ganglia of the abdomen are most fre quently preserved through all the stages of life in the lepid opterous and the hymenopterous insects and in those which have the segments of the abdomen the least altered from their larva condition by the process of metamorphosis but in this coleopterous insect fig d where the adult form of the whole body is very remote from that of a caterpillar or of an annelide all the ganglia have disappeared from the short round abdomen and have accumulated in three con tiguous masses in the middle of the thorax from which the nerves radiate to the organs of motion and extend back wards into all the segments of the abdomen the cephalic ganglia have also encreased above and below the oeso phagus the cerebral lobes passing laterally into the large compound eyes and the great sympathetic longitudinal series of supracesophageal ganglia with their accessary lateral filaments and ganglia b have advanced still more in their development the greatest change of the nervous system however from its original larva condition effected by the metamorphosis in insects is that presented by the pentatoma the cicada and some others where all the ganglia of the columns have accumulated in two points above and below the oesophagus in the head and in the middle of the thorax thus nearly approaching to the highest condi tion presented by this symmetrical nervous system in the most elevated tribes of crustacea and to the cyclogangliated character so general in the molluscous classes although during this rapid series of changes the last and the penulti mate pairs of ganglia are generally the earliest to ap proach and unite they are at first distinct pairs like those before them on the columns as seen in the annexed figure by lyonet of the three last pairs of ganglia and of the nerves which come from them in the larva of the cossus ligniperda fig a the upper portion a of the columns is seen to give off the interganglionic nerves d c which lyonet showed to be distributed on the respiratory organs after receiving a small connecting branch from the first pair of the next succeeding ganglionic or mixed nerves c c this arrangement of the motor and ganglionic nerves is represented at each interganglionic space along the columns it was likewise shown by lyonet that these motor nerves proceeding to the lateral muscles and respiratory or gans come from a tract occupying always the upper surface of the columns and distinctly passing over the upper surface of at least the last pair of ganglia it was however in the class arachnida that treviranus first pointed out more than twenty years ago in the ner vous system of the scorpion fig b the continuity of this motor tract b a over the upper surface of the whole extent of the columns and i have long shown the same structure to pervade the articulated classes the ner vous system like most other parts of the arachnida pre sents an intermediate condition of development betwixt that of most insects and that of the higher crustacea while the nervous columns of the scorpions with their accompanying series of ganglia are lengthened in form like those of lepi dopterous insects the same parts in the spiders have the concentrated form which they present in the highest crabs with their symmetrical ganglia concentrated in two points of the body the motor columns are large in the scorpion as in the scolopendra and are here also easily separated from the sensitive columns beneath them excepting where they pass over the surface of the ganglia from which they cannot be detached the whole of the columns are less intimately connected together and the interganglionic spaces are larger in the cavity of the abdomen than in the round narrow muscular tail or caudal portion of the trunk in this pos terior part of the body the motor columns are proportion ally more flat and more expanded over the ganglionic chords as they are likewise in crustacea and other articulated classes besides the cephalic or supracesophageal ganglia fig b and the large infraoesophageal mass of con centrated ganglia which radiates nerves to the five pairs of legs there are seven pairs of closely approximated ganglia b of a lengthened form disposed along the in ferior surface of the trunk the motor or respiratory nerves come off at the ganglia as in the myriapods and not at a distance from the ganglia as the interganglionic nerves of insects and crustacea towards the caudal extre mity of the scorpion the mixed nerves of the columns di verge suddenly in numerous minute fasciculi from the sides of the ganglionic spaces b g but as we advance in the trunk we find the whole of the mixed nerves coming off in one large fasciculus from each side of each double ganglion b the first and second pairs of ganglia b form a large white soft nervous mass occupy ing the anterior and lower part of the trunk immediately be neath the eyes this lobed mass is perforated obliquely by a small aperture through which the oesophagus passes to the stomach i have generally found the ganglionic spaces of the columns of the scorpion as in many insects closely en crusted with small white lobes of adipose substance in which the oesophageal nervous collar is likewise imbedded the in fraoesophageal ganglia are much larger than the first pair which have few and small parts to supply this second pair of gan glia composed of all the ganglia of the extremities b is protected behind by a cartilaginous arch through which the columns pass to the third pair of ganglia like the consolidated internal arch for the nervous column in the thorax of crustacea numerous large nervous branches proceed backwards along the inferior surface of the abdominal cavity from the infraoesopha geal ganglia b beneath the motor and sensitive co lumns as represented many years ago by treviranus and muller in their views of these columns in the scorpion in the short and rounded body of the spiders the supra and infraossophageal ganglia form a large nervous collar around the oesophagus the inferior portion of which as in the scor pions forms a large lobed mass from which all the nerves of the extremities radiate the supraossophageal ganglia are small here also from the imperfect development of the or gans of the senses and of mastication the ganglia of the abdomen which are extended along the trunk separately in the scorpions are accumulated into a single mass in the spiders and placed near the anterior part of their short and wide abdominal cavity thus the extent of concentration of the nervous columns of arachnida and the extent of dis tribution of their unsymmetrical or sympathetic system cor respond with the high condition of the other systems in this class and while they vary in the different tribes they ap proximate the more elevated forms to the highest insects and crustacea in the numerous and diversified class of crustacea we meet with every condition of the nervous system from that of the lowest annelide or the earliest larva state where scarcely a filament is yet perceptible in the place of the nervous columns to that concentration of the nervous ganglia around the oeso phagus which connects the highest articulata with the mol luscous classes the motor and sensitive columns are seen on a larger scale in the crustacea and they occupy the same relative position as those long known in the other entomoid classes the supracesophageal ganglia are generally larger than those of arachnida and smaller than those of insects they are for the most part united into a single cerebral ganglion de voted chiefly to the large organs of the senses and their nerves unite with the sympathetic as in insects and mollusca the ner vous ring of the oesophagus is here very wide but the columns are small which form it and they give offlarge branches to the stomach and the sympathetic while they pass along the sides of the oesophagus the ganglia of the cephalothorax vary much in their number their magnitude and their degree of approximation according to the form of that part of the trunk and the size of the several pairs of legs the motor columns are seen in the large macrourous decapods as in the post abdomen of the lobster fig a passing over the upper sur face of the sensitive columns and their ganglia c as a broad thin white fibrous layer and giving off lateral branches chiefly behind each pair of ganglia the largest trunks and mixed or motosensitive nerves of the columns come off at their ganglionic spaces c d these interganglionic motor nerves e e in the posterior portion of the trunk come off at a great er distance behind the ganglia as they do in insects but as we advance to the fore part of the body their origins be come approximated to the ganglia the posterior terminal pair of ganglia have generally a high position and are of great size where the caudal appendices of the trunk are much developed as in the longtailed decapods the same transverse and longitudinal approximation of the nervous columns and their gangliaseen in the inferior articulata is perceived in the development of the crustacea and the most concentrated form of the nervous system met with in the highest brachyourous decapods gra dually acquires this concentration of all its ganglia in two points of the body above and below the oesophagus fig d by passing through all the inferior conditions which pre sent themselves as permanent or adult forms in this class many of the lower amphipoda and isopoda have the segments nearly equally developed from the anterior to the posterior extremity of the trunk and this equal development is seen also in the nervous columns and ganglia of these segments as shewn in the annexed figure of those of the talitrus locust a or common sandhopper fig a the slender longitudi nal columns and the minute ganglia along their course here remain distinctly separated from each other by a small space on the median plain the ganglia are nearly of the same size from the first pair above the oesophagus a to the caudal pair and the pairs are almost equidistant along the whole trunk in a longitudinal direction this simplest adult form of the nervous system shown by audouin and edwards in the talitrus has been pointed out likewise by rathke in the idotea and the same is seen through the trans parent bodies of many other minute isopods the same form of the nervous columns is seen in the highest crustacea while yet in their embryo condition in the ovum in the short and broad trunk of the cymothoa where the legs are still equally developed along the whole sides of the body the nervous columns fig b have already approximated to touch each other on the median plain and the ganglia on the two sides have coalesced to form a single chain along the middle of the abdominal surface of the body the ganglia are still nearly equidistant and equally developed along the columns but where the minute posterior tapering segments of this animal have advanced and united their ganglionic matter appears likewise to have been carried forwards to en large the ninth or terminal ganglion fig b the transverse concentration of the columns and ganglia towards the median plain thus seen in the lowest crustacea is suc ceeded in higher species by a longitudinal movement of the nervous matter directed as we have seen in inferior classes of articulata chiefly to two points of the body the head and the thorax from which the largest and most important ap pendices of the body whether for sensation mastication or progressive motion are developed in the longtailed deca pods as the lobster fig c and the crayfish not only is the sympathetic system of nerves derived from the lateral ganglia of the stomach greatly developed as shown nearly twenty years since by succow and the ganglia and columns have coalesced and met transversely along the whole body but in the region of the thorax from which the five pairs of large extremities are developed the ganglia fig c a have both enlarged in size above those of the postabdomen c and considerably approximated to each other in a longitudinal direction in the higher enh tomoid articulata the segments first coalesce on the anterior and posterior portions of the trunk and hence the enlarged form presented by their cephalic and caudal ganglia indepen dent of the great size often attained by the appendices deve loped from the terminal parts of the body the ganglia and columns of the postabdomen in these macrourous decapods c as shown by succow retain much of their primi tive simple form like the segments and appendices of that portion of the trunk but the last ganglion c advanced to the penultimate segment is here of great size from the magnitude of the swimming appendices developed from the two caudal segments the thoracic ganglia and columns are excluded from the general cavity of the trunk and are en closed in a distinct canal with solid calcified parietes prolong ed inwards from the exterior shell the most concentrated form of the nervous system met with in the crustacea and its highest condition presented by this articulated division of the animal kingdom is that found in the short and broad trunks of the brachyourous decapods fig d where all the symmetrical ganglia of the columns are generally col lected into two masses the one in the head and the other in the centre of the cephalothorax and where the mo tor and sensitive columns are almost confined to a nervous band around the wide oesophagus the anterior of these or the supracesophageal ganglion d is comparatively small in the brachyourous decapods from the smalmess of the cephalic appendices which it supplies with nerves the infracesophageal nervous mass d is of great size consisting of the whole chain of ganglia which was originally extended along the body behind the oesophagus and is favourably situated between the haunches of the legs under a strong internal osseous arch in the centre of the trunk it sends out numerous branches to the surrounding viscera and to the five pairs of legs which radiate from around that point and the columns are prolonged backwards ramifying along the short slender postabdomen as a simple nervous chord there are many intermediate conditions of these nervous columns and ganglia between those of the asta cus fig c and of the maia fig d some of the macrourous decapods having the thoracic ganglia much more approximated than in the former and many of the bra chyourous species having them less concentrated into a mass than in the latter and similar links are observed to connect together the typical forms of this system in the other orders of crustacea and throughout all the articulated classes thus the most elevated form of the nervous axis met with in this division of the animal kingdom begins its development with two simple abdominal filaments like the lowest hel minthoid form of entozoa and by a gradual process of con centration proceeding transversely and longitudinally from the peripheral to the central parts it arrives at the cyclogan gliated character of the molluscous classes with its great symmetrical ganglia confined to the resophageal ring nervous system of the cyclogangliated or molluscous classes the nervous system is distinctly developed and pro vided with several ganglionic centres in all the molluscous classes from the lowest compound forms of tunicata to the highest of the cephalopods and notwithstanding the remarkable diversity of form which the animals of this division present we can trace a certain similarity of cha racter and unity of plan in the development of this system and in its typical forms throughout all the cyclogangliated classes as all molluscous animals are aquatic excepting a few of the gasteropods their nervous fibres present the same soft and pellucid character observed in other aquatic invertebrata which often renders it less easy to trace their ramifications and to detect their plan of distribution than to follow the denser opaque fibres of the airbreathing tribes and has repeatedly caused them to be mistaken for sanguiferous or chyliferous vessels in the short and broad trunks of the animals of this division as in the round bodies of the radiata the nervous system is characterised by a tendency to accumulate around the entrance to the alimentary canal but from the high position of the molluscous classes in the scale their nervous oesophageal collar is provided with distinct and often numerous ganglia the same co lumnar arrangement of the great nervous centres which i have long observed and described in most of the articulated classes i have found to exist also in the molluscous though in a less extended or rectilineal form in the tunicated and conchiferous animals the columns are chiefly disposed beneath the alimentary canal in the gasteropods and the pteropods they are more equally distributed around the entrance to the stomach and in the more elevated forms of cephalopods they at length mount to that supracesophageal position which they preserve in all the vertebrata where they cease to embrace the alimentary canal in the lowest compound tunicated animals as in the botryllus and the pyrosoma there is a small round white coloured opaque ganglion within the muscular tunic of each of the com ponent animals placed near the entrance of the respiratory sac and between that orifice and the anal when we com pare the position of the tho racic cavity fig andits apertures a b in the tuni cata with those of the conch ifera we perceive that this single median ganglion e is situate on the ventral side of the body though at some distance from the entrance g to the stomach h this ganglion is seen in the same position in the minute com ponent animals of the poly clinum the aplidium the di demnum the euccelium the synoicum the diazona and the distoma in the larger forms of simple ascidia as in the boltenia phallusia and cynthia fig this last ganglion e has generally a more lengthened oval form and i have sometimes found it bifid both before and behind where two nervous branches come off from each of its extremities the two anterior nervous branches are larger than the two posterior which pass backwards on each side of the anal opening b of the muscular tunic the anterior pair encompasses the respiratory orifice a sending off filaments to the fringed and highly sensitive tentacula c which guard this thoracic aperture these two branches again meet behind the orifice d and continue as a broad chord along the dorsal part of the muscular coat or mantle besides this ganglion which is connected with the muscular apparatus of the respiratory sac and its openings like the posterior pair of ganglia in the conchifera which are also sometimes united into one three other ganglia are observed in
