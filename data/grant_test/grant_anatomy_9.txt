b i with its two peduncles ex tending forwards over the thalami optici the optic thalami covered by the cerebral hemispheres are connected by a cine ritious commissura mollis the optic lobes are without trans verse exterior sulci and the hemispheres are destitute of convolutions though partially divided into two lobes a d e by the fissura sylvii the cerebral hemispheres covered externally with cineritious matter smooth and undulated on the surface broad posteriorly and tapering suddenly forwards to the ethmoid bone cover the thalami optici and the cor pora striata and contain each a small ventricle which extends forwards to the olfactory tubercles a the cerebral hemispheres b i are composed chiefly of the ascending and diverging fibres of the corpora pyramidalia and are con nected by an anterior commissure and the crossing fibres of a rudimentary corpus callosum the olfactory tubercles a commencing from two medullary tracts a h h on the inferior surface of the hemispheres and containing prolongations of the lateral ventricles are still covered with cineritious substance and taper forwards to the olfactory nerves greatly reduced from their proportions in the inferior vertebrata the choroid plexus is obvious in each of the lateral ventricles which communicate below with the third ventricle and the corpora striata form lengthened transverse eminences the third ventricle communicates behind with the fourth by the aqueductus sylvii beneath the transverse valve of vieussenius and is continued downwards in front to the infundibulum and petuitary gland which here forms a shorter hypophysis on the sella tursica than in reptiles all the lobes and cavities are immediately invested and lined by the pia mater and the dura mater lining the cranium forms a distinct tentorium corebelli and a rudimentary falx ce rebri the sensitive spinal nerves of birds have their ganglia larger and approximated more nearly to their origins than in reptiles and from the retraction and high termination of the spinal chord as well as the comparative magnitude of the legs in this class the posterior ganglionic enlargement is re markable for its size and at this place the motor and sensitive roots pass out through separate foramina of the numerous anchylosed sacral vertebrae the twelve pairs of cranial nerves are here distinct as in reptiles and mammalia the olfactory nerves still provided with distinct glandular tubercles a arise from two transverse medullary bands a h ex tending as in mammalia to the fissure of sylvius and pass forward through the narrow tapering osseous canals formed by the frontal and ethmoid bones the optic nerves a i y corresponding in magnitude with the large eyes and the optic lobes from which they originate unite before the hypo physis and partially decussate their numerous interwoven component fasciculi before proceeding to the optic foramina the motores oculorum pass to the three innermost recti mus cles and the inferior obliquus of the eye the trochlearis to the superior obliquus and the abducens to the rectus exterior muscle as in other classes the large trigeminus sends its ophthalmic branch to the upper parts of the face and nose the superior maxillary branch to the sides of the face and upper mandible and the inferior maxillary branch chiefly to the lower jaw the two last branches exhibit a dental distri bution in the serrated mandibles of many aquatic birds as in the toothed jaws of quadrupeds the smallness of the facial nerve corresponds with the immobility and insensibility of the superficial parts of the face and the magnitude of the acoustic nerve with the great development of their internal ear and their acute hearing especially in nocturnal birds the glossopharyngeal passes as usual to the tongue and pharynx the hypoglossal chiefly to the root of the tongue and upper larynx and the pneumogastric communicating at the base of the cranium with the accessory descends with the jugular vein along the neck to be distributed on the lungs the in ferior larynx the oesophagus and stomach especially the ventriculus succenturiatus the spinal nerves are chiefly cervical and sacral from the number of vertebrae composing these parts of the column and the brachial and lumbar plexuses are formed and distributed on the arms and legs nearly as in quadrupeds the sympathetic greatly encreased in its development presents distinct lateral ganglia from the base of the skull to the end of the coccyx it unites anteriorly with the pneumogastric the facial and the trigeminal nerves and at its posterior end the lateral ganglia become approxi mated and united on the median plain under the coccygeal vertebra it forms distinct ganglia and plexuses around the great arteries for the viscera of the trunk its cervical por tion is protected along with the vertebral arteries in the foramina of the transverse processes and it is every where connected by anastomosing filaments with the spinal nerves along the sides of the vertebral column as in other classes in the mammiferous animals a higher grade of the develop ment of this system is perceptible in the magnitude and ex tension of the spinal chord and of the cerebral and cere bellic hemispheres in the encreased number of internal cineritious deposits in all parts of the white fibrous spino cerebral axis in the more complete union of all the lateral parts of this axis by means of decussating fasciculi and various commissures of converging fibres in the encreased size and approximation of the ganglia on all the symmetrical sensitive nerves and in the more methodical and extensive distribution of the great sympathetic and its appropriation to individual organs the spinal chord though encreased in its proportion to the bulk of the body is now less in proportion to the cerebral mass than in the inferior classes its internal longitudinal canal has almost become obliterated its lateral halves are more intimately united together and the crescentic columns of cineritious matter have en creased in their interior the spinal chord is prolonged to a variable extent through the column being shortest in the tailless cheiroptera qua drumana and man and longest in the cetacea where it ex tends tapering through the coccygeal vertebrae without pos terior enlargement from the want of legs as in apodal fishes and tadpoles and serpents and the human embryo in the longtailed quadrupeds the spinal chord is extended to the sacrum and the detached nerves of the cauda equina are prolonged through the coccygeal vertebrae the ganglionic enlargement of the spinal chord at the origin of each pair of motosensitive nerves is now scarcely apparent and the en largements corresponding to the atlantal and sacral extremi ties are of a more lengthened and fusiform shape the medulla oblongata is comparatively narrow but it is more deeply marked by the limits of the corpora pyramidalia olivaria and restiformia the decussations of the corpora pyramidalia are more numerous and distinct and the cine ritious matter of the corpus dentatum is generally percep tible in the corpora olivaria which are themselves propor tionally small the crura cerebri are traversed below by the great commissure of the cerebellic hemispheres the tuber annulare which is more or less provided internally with transverse strata of cineritious matter the optic lobes reduced in size generally without ca vities and traversed externally by sulci which give them a quadrigeminous appearance are largest and most exposed above in the lowest mammalia as the rodentia and edentata they are larger in herbivorous than in carnivorous quadrupeds and are least in bulk and most concealed in quadrumana and man the anterior lobes of the corpora quadrigemina are larger than the posterior in herbivorous mammalia the posterior are the larger in carnivora and these lobes are nearly equal in the highest orders of this class the ce rebral hemispheres follow a contrary ratio in their deve lopment being smallest and destitute of convolutions in the rodentia and becoming larger in every dimension and more marked with deep convolutions as we advance up wards to man the optic thalami and the corpora striata encrease with the expanding hemispheres while the olfactory tubercles progressively dimmish the olfactory tubercles are greater in size more cineritious externally and contain wider prolongations of the lateral ventricles in herbivorous than in carnivorous quadrupeds the lateral ventricles always present the anterior and inferior cornua the choroid plexus and the tonia semicircularis between the thalami and the corpora striata the great transverse commissure of the cerebral hemispheres the corpus callosum is here at its max imum of development as are also the anterior and posterior commissurse cerebri and the fornix and we can always per ceive the hippocampus major the septum lucidum between the lateral ventricles and the pineal gland with its two pe duncles the cineritious matter is now less abundant on the surface of the brain proportionally to the white fibrous part within and the external convolutions which are still wanting on the smooth birdlike brains of the montrema and the rodentia are very superficial in the cetacea edentata ruminantia and pachyderma the convolutions penetrate deeper in the large expanded hemispheres of carnivora qua lrumana and man where we observe also the cerebrum to pass more and more backwards over the cerebellum the symmetry of the convolutions on the two cerebral hemi spheres is most distinct where they are few and deep as in carnivora and quadrumana and the laminae of the cerebellic hemispheres encrease in number and depth as we ascend to man the brain of herbivorous quadrupeds is thus distin guished by several indications of inferior development from that of carnivorous species as seen in comparing the brain of the pecari dicotyles torquatus fig a with that of the lion felis leo fig b in the herbivora the spinal chord and medulla oblongata a b are larger and broader compared with the cerebral parts which lie before them than in the carnivora b a b and in the carnivora the corpora pyramidalia b b the crura cerebri b d the cerebral hemispheres b h the corpus callosum the cerebellic hemispheres b and the tuber annulare bc are proportionally larger than the corresponding parts in the vegetableeating quadrupeds a the convolutions are more superficial on the narrow and short cerebral hemi spheres of the pecari a g h the hollow olfactory tu bercles or processus mammillares a c communicating by wide canals with the lateral ventricles are larger the in fundibulum a e like the hypophysis of a reptile is more broad and extended the corpora quadrigemina are larger and less covered by the hemispheres and the trans verse sulcus divides them more posteriorly than in the lion b this transverse sulcus is wanting on the optic lobes of the ornithorhyncus where they are nearly as smooth and undivided as those of a bird and its cerebral hemi spheres are destitute of convolutions like those of many rodentia edentata and marsupialia the broad cerebral he mispheres of the lion are surpassed in lateral extension by those of the seals and these parts in the dolphin surpass those of all the other mammalia by their great breadth and by the number of their superficial convolutions but in none of these animals are the cerebellic hemispheres entirely covered by the extension backwards of the cerebral till we ascend to the higher quadrumana where we find in the pithed or orangs almost every other character of the human spinocere bral axis already distinctly developed as the hippocampus minor and posterior cornu of the lateral ventricles the deep cerebral convolutions and numerous cerebellic laminae the cineritious substance of the corpora olivaria and the large corpora dentata or ganglionic nuclei of the cerebellic hemispheres while the great nervous centres have thus arrived at their maximum of development in mammalia most of the cranial nerves like the spinal chord when compared to them are proportionately small the olfactory nerves and tubercles are largest in the ruminantia and pachydernia a k smaller in the carnivora b i cheiroptera and quadru mana and are scarcely discoverable in several of the cetacea in the inferior orders and in the large eyed nocturnal qua drupeds the optic nerves are of greater size than in diurnal and higher species and in the blind subterranean moles not only are the optic nerves extremely minute but the motores oculorum the trochleares and the abducentes can scarcely be detected the optic nerves in this class unite before the infundibulum where they form a partial decussation of their component fibres b and the ophthalmic ganglion is always perceptible in the orbit the second and third branches of the trigeminus have a great external distribution in the longmuzzled the proboscidian and the largelipped quadrupeds as the cetacea ruminantia pachyderma and car nivora and their internal dental distribution varies according to the number and magnitude of the teeth and of the per forated fangs which they supply their development is also influenced by the presence of horns on the frontal or nasal bones or of spines or bristles extending from the upper lip as in aquatic and terrestrial carnivora or by other circum stances which influence the general form of the head or face and the same causes influence the development of the facial nerves and their branches as in the inferior classes of verte brated animals the bills of the ornithorhyncus like those of many aquatic birds are supplied with large branches of the superior and inferior maxillary nerves and the pneumogas tric nerve in this animal is not united to the cervical portion of the sympathetic as it generally is in the neck of quadru peds as the plan of development is most constant and ob vious in the great centres of animal and of vegetative life the spinocerebral axis and the great sympathetic it is chiefly in those parts that we observe the highest condition arrived at in the human body the spinal chord of man fig b i is smaller compared with the cerebral mass contained within the cranium than in other mammalia and short from the want of caudal prolongation of the trunk its posterior and middle enlargements c e are conspicuous and of a lengthened form from the magnitude and number of the nerves which proceed from them to the sacral and atlantal extremities the cauda equina a b is of great length from the high and sudden termination of the spinal chord the motor roots i and anterior columns are smaller than the sensi tive as in other animals and the ganglia of the posterior or sensitive roots of the spinal nerves are here larger than in other mam malia the medulla oblon gata though comparatively small has its component fasciculi most deeply marked and the quantity of internal ganglionic matter in the course forwards of these white fibrous fasciculi cor responds with their great development in the human cerebral and cerebellic he mispheres where the convo lutions g and laminae h i surpass in num ber and depth those of al most all inferior animals but where the use or func tion of any filament has not yet been determined the great systems of converging fibres which cross the median plain which form the corpus callosum the tuber annu lare and the various smaller commissures and which have appeared to some as conti nuous with the diverging or ascending fibres from the periphery of the cerebral mass and as forming the posterior or sensitive columns of the spinal chord by their descent from the brain are larger than in the lower orders of quadrupeds the periphery of the whole body is now the most largely supplied with symmetrical nerves of motion and sensation whose roots are the most imbedded and approximated the great central columns of these nerves are the most intimately and compactly united to each other in every part of the axis and in passing from the embryo state to this most complicated condition the great spinocerebral axis of man presents successively the various conditions exhibited as adult forms in the lower classes of animals the great sympathetic also presents its highest condition of development in quadrupeds and man being here most intimately united with all the spinal and cranial nerves from the caudal extremity of the trunk to the trigemini or fifth pair of cranial nerves it forms numerous distinct cineritious ganglia in the head on both sides of the neck along the two sides of the vertebral column and in the three great cavities of the trunk the thorax the abdomen and the pelvis embracing with its large anastomos ing plexuses and ganglia the great arteries proceeding to the viscera and thus it establishes in the most com plicated of animal forms the greatest unity of action and mutual dependence of all the organs of animal and of vege tative life chapter fifth organs of the senses first section general observations on the organs of the senses the power of locomotion enjoyed by animals and their mode of nutrition by the conveyance of foreign matter into an internal sac require them to possess the means of obtain ing cognizance of the properties of surrounding objects that they may direct their motions suitably to their ends and distinguish what is congenial from what is deliterious to their nature these means of establishing the most intimate relation between external objects and the internal sentient principle are the organs of the senses which are instruments placed at the peripheral extremities of certain sensitive nerves generally those nearest the anterior extremity of the trunk or around the entrance of the alimentary canal and which vary in their structure according to the properties of outward matter to which they relate the organs of the senses are thus necessarily placed in connexion with the external surface of animals and are not situate upon any of the insen sitive motor nerves which merely communicate activity to the muscular fibres nor upon the great ganglionic or sympa thetic system of unsymmetrical nerves by which the organs of vegetative life throughout every point of the body are kept in incessant activity without our consciousness but only upon the distal terminations of the symmetrical sensi tive filaments of the great nervous axis of animal life in the vertebrated animals these optical acoustic and other in struments destined to modify the external impressions so as to produce more distinct perceptions are mostly placed at the ends of the sensitive nerves which issue from the inter vertebral foramina of the cranium and are supplied by other nervous branches indispensible to their function the cir cumstances which necessitate the existence of such organs in animals also require them to be more numerous and va ried in higher than in lower tribes and to be most perfect and delicate where the locomotive powers and consequently the dangers are greatest hence they are more developed in the active insects and other entomoid articulata than in the slow and torpid mollusca and are most numerous and perfect in the vertebrated animals where they have to watch over the most complicated and delicate forms of organisation the columns of nerves appropriated to sensation are greater than those of motion throughout the animal kingdom and they are spread more extensively through every part of the body so that almost every point is sensitive to impressions of the density or resistance of outward bodies to the feel ings of heat and cold and to that of pain when they are in jured this general sensibility which watches over the wellbeing of every part of the body is most acute in the skin the common covering of all the organs and the sensa tions belonging to all the senses are but modifications of this as their organs also are mostly developments from the cutaneous covering of the body as the apparatus for diges tion are the most important to the maintenance of life and next to the cutaneous covering the most universal in the animal kingdom the general sense of touch is probably first modified or speciallized at their entrance to constitute that of taste which most immediately relates to this function and so are successively developed the various other senses of animals as those of smelling hearing and vision of which we are conscious and which make known the physical or the chemical properties of external objects at greater and greater distances from the sentient body the sentient nerves are thus very differently modified at their peripheral expanded terminations to adapt them for receiving impressions from bodies directly applied to the skin or from sapid bodies dis solved in the secretions of the mouth or from odorous ema nations diffused through the surrounding element or from simple undulations of that element reaching the surface of the body or from those finer vibrations which constitute the phenomena of light there may be many other kinds of impressions derived from outward bodies for which the sensitive nerves of the lower animals are adapted besides those which affect us and we cannot always be certain of the identity of the feelings communicated to them by organs which appear analogous to our own although we often cannot detect distinct organs for the senses which we ascribe to the lower animals these organs are commonly enumerated according to the supposed generality of their function in the animal kingdom from the most general feeling of the nervous system or the sense of touch to that of vision or of hearing but the most general organ of sense perceptible in animals as superadded to the nerves of feeling already de scribed is that of vision which relates to light so universally diffused through nature and so influential on both kingdoms of organized beings and even on the constitution and proper ties of unorganized bodies second section organs of vision many animals like plants are affected sensibly by light without their exhibiting either organs of vision or a single filament of nervous matter as plants guided by light open and close their flowers and their leaves or follow with their expanded flowers the diurnal course of the sun or seek his light with their slowmoving branches and their leaves with out a perceptible nervous system so we observe the nerve less gemmules of poriferous animals and of zoophytes guided by the same agent in selecting a proper place for fixing and developing the hydra without eyes or nerves uniformly moves to the light the eyeless actinia shuns its influence and many zoophytes expand or contract their whole body or their polypi from the influence of this agent though desti tute of visual organs distinct organs however appropriated to light are already perceptible in animals where no nervous filament has been detected in any part of the body many polygastric animal cules as the cercaria are obviously sensible to light and move towards it like the hydrse and they generally present on the anterior part of their body one or more small round opaque red coloured spots which have long been recognised figured and described as the eyes of these minute animals several as the euglena longicanda and ophryoglena flavicans have but one eye placed on the middle of the upper and anterior part of their body a monoculous character in which they resemble the microscopic species of some higher classes of animals eyes have been detected in most of the genera of polygastrica down to the monads which are mostly mono culous and even the minute monadlike beings which unite to form the volvox globator the eudorina elegans and some other remarkable compound or aggregate animalcules are provided with single redcoloured organs of vision placed near the part of their trunk from which the caudiform vibra tile appendix is prolonged these minute red points of the polygastrica are as obviously eyes though of the simplest structure as are those of rotifera where we can perceive their optic nerves and ganglia and where they have the same red colour and general disposition as in the polygastrica this superficial or cutaneous opaque spot to absorb the rays of light without forming an image of external objects is the first form of the eye which we see also in annelides and in the larvae of insects and the young of higher classes when that organ is beginning to develop so that when the optic nerve is superadded to this pigment or choroid or coloured rete mucosum it is first developed behind this opaque mat ter as we frequently find it placed in the eyes of inverte brated animals even when transparent parts are added to collect light or to form an image of external objects to be transmitted through a hole in this choroidal pigment to the subjacent nerve the numerous vibratile organs of locomo tion and the rapid movements and free condition of polygas trica require this general development of visual organs in them while the slow movements or the fixed condition of most other radiated animals render less necessary in them the development of organs of this nature and they have not been detected in any of the poripherous or the polypipherous animals unless the bright coloured opaque points seen on the disk of the locomotive actiniae and of some other polypi are organs destined to absorb and to communicate impres sions of light in the acalepha organs of vision have yet been observed only in the medusa aurita where they are mi nute round points on the dorsal side of eight brown globules placed on little peduncles in the eight depressions around the free edge of the mantle and they have the same red co lour as those of many other transparent animals as polygas trica rotifera and entomostracous crustacea these eight small red pedunculated eyes directed upwards are provided each with a crystalline lens an optic ganglion and two de cussating optic nerves derived from the exterior circle of nerves which accompany the marginal canal of the mantle and they are placed near the bases of the marginal tentacula like the numerous marginal pedunculated shining eyes of a spondylis or a pecten among the conchifera the organs of vision in the echinoderma as well as those of the acalepha have been long figured by authors though their nature has been till lately overlooked beneath the distal extremity of each radiating division of the body of the asterias violacea and asterias militaris a small circumscribed round red coloured retractile point is observed as represented by vahl which rests upon a small optic ganglion at the end of each of the five radiating nerves these are analogous in their position and characters to the common visual organs of ani mals thus low in the scale and probably will be found on holothurise and other active echinoderma where the nervous system is most developed they yet present no transparent parts besides the cornea which has sometimes a glistening or shining appearance even in polygastrica the organs of vision like the nervous and muscular sys tems and all the other organs of relation present a high degree of development in the lively and active articulated animals and they are common in almost every class of this division from the general structure and habits of the entozoa and the density and opacity of the medium in which they commonly reside they little require the aid of eyes or of any other or gans of sense and none have been detected in the lowest cystic forms of this class in the scolex however among the ces toid entozoa two minute redcoloured shining eyes have been long observed and two of a dark colour are found be hind the mouth in the polystoma one of the flat trematoid worms but these organs are more commonly perceived on those remarkable entomoid kinds of parasitic worms which attach themselves to the surface of aquatic animals and are in that situation more exposed to the influence of light and of the surrounding element as various forms of lernsese the eyes are sessile in these epizoa and most commonly form a single organ on the median plain as in many of the entomostracous crustacea which they at first so much re semble in some the eyes are more numerous and are placed apart from each other as in the gyrodactylus auricu latus found attached to the gills of the bream where there are four minute redcoloured eyes placed in two pairs be hind each other on the back part of the head in the ach theres percarum there is a single round prominent eye on the fore part of the head between the two short antennae which is very obvious through the coverings of the ovum and in the young animal in its free unattached condition and in this species the organ of vision remains through the whole of life but in the lernceocera cypinacea where the little red coloured circular eye placed on the fore part of the head is also distinctly seen in the ovum and continues through out the free and entomostracous state of this remarkable animal it is entirely lost after the metamorphosis and no trace of it can be detected in the adult fixed condition of this parasitic worm the same disappearance of the eyes has been observed in some of the rotifera in nearly all the rotiferous animalcules however eyes are distinctly observ able of a round form of a red colour often two in number sometimes united to form a single organ sometimes four as in the meglotrocha or a greater number as in the cydoglena and placed on the upper and fore part of the body their constancy x their number and their high development in the wheelanimalcules corresponds with the general advanced organization and the numerous active organs of locomotion possessed by these minute transparent animals from the transparency of all their parts and the deep red colour of the choroidal pigment the eyes of the rotifera like those of the epizoa and those of most of the higher articulata and mol lusca are very obvious in the embryos while yet within the ovarium or while the unhatched ova are yet suspended from the exterior of the parent they are commonly placed near the large supraoesophageal ganglion and nervous filaments are sometimes observed distinctly to pass into these organs they are protected by a smooth transparent and sometimes glistening cornea and when these little eyes are pressed be tween plates of mica or glass the eyeball is seen to burst and the deep red pigment consisting of minute globules united together by a transparent matter is seen to escape from the ruptured organ a minute crystalline lens has also been observed in some behind the transparent cornea the fixed condition of the cirrhopods in their adult state inverted in their shell and the opacity of their exterior covering afford little occasion for the employment of visual organs in that condition of their life and they have not been observed in any of the mature animals of this class before their metamorphosis however in their young and free con dition the cirrhopods possess a distinct black coloured me dian organ of vision formed by the juxtaposition of the two lateral eyes as in many monoculous animals of other classes these two eyes formed by the division of one primary organ appear to be covered with a smooth transparent cornea and to enclose a small crystalline lens and they are lost by the metamorphosis like the eyes of many other articulated animals in most of the free annelides there are numerous and very distinct organs of vision which commonly project shining or glistening from the dorsal surface of the head and contain a minute transparent lens added to the variously coloured dark pigment and the optic nerve the eyes are here generally sim ple sessile slightly moveable and placed apart from each in transverse or longitudinal rows in the little prostoma arma tum the head is covered with oculiform points of a dark colour in the minute prostoma clepsinoideum a small planaria there are six of these organs and in other species of prostoma four are observed several of the planaria have two deep co loured eyes in some as the planaria viganensis there is a single row of about forty eyes passing round all the fore part of the body and the same arrangement is seen in the planaria nigra which corresponds with the circular arrange ment of the same organs around the margin of the mantle in some of the most active conchifera the same transverse arrangement is seen in the ten prominent eyes disposed across the head of the medicinal leech in the bdella nilotica there are six eyes disposed transversely on the upper part of the first segment in the polynoe impatiens they are disposed laterally in pairs the optic nerves of some of the higher annelides are observed to terminate in a broad circular pa pilla or retinal expansion the choroid pigment behind the crystalline lens in the medicinal leech is red in the young animal and changes to black in the adult state as observed in many other animals in the nereis nuntia fig there are four large eyes disposed symmetrically in two pairs on the upper part of the head and nearly a hundred smaller ocular points disposed in rows and groups on all the promi nent lobes around the mouth in the syllis monilaris there are two pairs of eyes with prominent glistening cornese dis posed on the upper segment of the head in some of the higher forms of this class however as the euphrosine laureata and the oenone lucida the visual organs are reduced to two symmetrically disposed on the upper part of the first seg ment of the head and thus approach to the normal character of these organs in most of the higher classes of animals in the entomoid classes of articulata the most active of all the invertebrated animals the organs of vision are very nume rous and commonly aggregated together to form two groups or two compound eyes symmetrically disposed on the upper or la teral parts of the head a compound character which com mences as low as the rotifera by the approximation of the se parate ocular points the eyes of the myriapods partake some times of the character of those of the inferior annelides and sometimes of those of the higher forms of insects and in some species no organs of vision have been detected most of these animals present numerous separate simple eyes grouped together on the two sides of the head the two lateral eyes of the scolopendra consist each of a group of about twentythree small distinct eyes approximated and placed in lineal rows and the aggregate eyes of the iulus are also composed of several rectilineal rows the scuttgera has large eyes like those of an insect where however the several cornese are more round and larger than in the compound organs of the true hexapodous insects the compound eyes of insects consist merely of a closer ag gregate of many of these more detached organs of the myria pods forming hemispherical sessile masses of sometimes ten or twenty thousand eyes on each side of the head and these are often accompanied by a few small separate simple eyes placed more posteriorly lewenhoek calculated facetts in the eye of a libellula they are compound even in the apterous lepisma where they are accompanied by three simple eyes as in many of the higher winged insects but the coleop terous insects which approach nearest to the higher crus tacea in the concentrated forms of many of their organs possess only the two compound eyes the larvae of the co leoptera and hymenoptera are often destitute of eyes in the compound eyes of insects the epidermis appears to continue as we see in serpents over the exposed surface of the globe but colourless and transparent beneath this ex terior covering are placed the numerous transparent prismatic hexagonal facettes or corneae of the several minute compo nent eyes as seen in the annexed section of a part of the eye of melolontha vulgaris fig a within this thick continuous exterior layer of aggregated transparent hexagonal corneas are placed the small conical transparent lenses a b b b of a regular tapering form and smooth rounded surface of a firm horny texture and colourless transparency the hexagonal corneas of the sphinx atropos are only the sixtieth of a line in diameter the flat bases of the lenses directed outwards are applied to the inner surface of the corneee and their pointed apex is turned inwards to the pe ripheral or retinal ends of the separate minute optic nerves a c these small conical horny lenses are easily scraped off from the inner surface of the cornea when their regular form and smooth surface b b b are best ex amined and they acquire a whitish opaque colour by the ac tion of alcohol like the fibrous lenses of the higher classes of animals they are surrounded by the choroid pigment and in some insects as the libellula this coloured choroid forms a sort of iris or uvea between the flat base of the lenses and inner surface of the cornese and appear to leave space for a small quantity of aqueous humour the lenses are very long in the eyes of the libellulse where they form lengthened slender nearly parallel cylinders tapering very slightly to the retinal ends of the optic nerves they are generally shorter in proportion to their breadth in other insects like those of the melolontha b b b the separate slender optic nerves a c proceed backwards from the apices of the lenses though the semifluid pigment or vitreous humour consisting of variously coloured globules to the great optic ganglion within the globe of the eye which is almost a prolongation of the cerebral or optic lobes them selves fig d the undulations or rays of light have thus an uninterrupted passage in the compound eyes of insects through the outer transparent homogenous epidermic covering then through the transparent central axes of the prismatic hexagonal cornese and lastly through the pupilar openings of the choroid and the axes of the conical hard lenses behind them where they reach the terminal or retinal papillae of the several optic nerves by which the impressions are felt or transmitted to the brain besides these compound eyes insects in their mature state often present at the back part of the head several simple de tached sessile eyes or ocelli like those common in the infe rior articulated classes and these are alone developed in the larvastate of insects with perfect metamorphosis as those of orthoptera in these ocelli of the larvae as shown by lyonet in that of the cossus ligniperda nearly the same structure exists as in each of the component organs in the compound eye of the perfect insect there are six ocelli in the cossus disposed in a circular order on the parietal lamina they have a cuplike form each is covered with its convex cornea having a transparent axis and behind this is the little hard spherical crystalline lens together with the vitreous humour the chorid and its pigment and the optic nerve each ocellus receives a branch of a trachea along with its nervous filament and the tracheae have been traced also into the compound eyes of perfect insects most generally there are three ocelli in perfect insects behind each compound eye on the sides of the head some insects as the claviger appear to possess neither simple nor compound eyes nor any other organ of vision like many of the helminthoid animals beneath them the eyes of the higher forms of insects are thus numerous and varied in their directions from the ses sile and immoveable character of these organs and to suit the rapid and varied movements of these animals and they compensate for the want of the external protecting apparatus of higher classes by the density and insensibility of the out ward exposed parts of these organs which they cleanse from adhering matter by the brushes of hair developed on their tarsi or some other moveable parts hairs are often deve loped from the surface of the compound eyes originating from the depressions between the hexagonal cornese and some times the margins of the corneae are themselves extended outward like the hexagonal tubes of a honeycomb as in the sty fops the eyes of the arachnida are the largest and most perfect forms of the ocelli met with in the articulated classes like those of the myriapods they are simple and sessile organs while those of crustacea are compound like those of insects and are generally pedunculated from two to twelve of these smooth eyes are found in the arachnida and the largest forms of the organs are presented by the scorpions where their structure has consequently been most satisfactorily ex amined they are commonly arranged symmetrically in one or two transverse rows on the upper and fore part of the ce phalothorax as we observe those generally eight in number arranged on the back of the spiders beneath the prominent convex cornea in the large ocelli of the scorpion there is a spherical firm transparent lens more like that of a molluscous or of a vertebrated animal than that commonly found in the entomoid articulata there is a considerable vitreous humour filling half of the eyeball placed behind the crystalline lens and surrounded by the pigmentum and the choroid excepting on the fore part where it bounds the pupil like an iris and on the back part where it is penetrated by the optic nerve the optic nerve expands into a cuplike retina investing with the hyaloid membrane all the convex posterior surface of the vitreous humour a disposition of the vitreous humour with its retinal and hyaloid membranes very similar to this has been observed even in the compound eyes of some noc turnal lepidopterous insects which is perhaps more general in that class so that this optical instrument has already all the essential parts presented by the highest forms of the organ and approaches the nearest to that of the vertebrata the structure of the simple eyes or ocelli of the mygaleand of the tarantulse appears to be the same as that of the scorpion the eyes of crustaceous animals are compound like those of insects in the higher orders they are pedunculated and moveable by means of muscles inserted within their exterior hard sclerotic covering they are commonly sessile and immove able like those of insects in the inferior crustacea and in the lowest entomostracous forms the two sessile eyes are frequently united on the median plain to form a single organ a character approximating these parasitic crustacea to the epizoa and to many other inferior articulata the internal structure of these compound eyes is nearly the same as those of insects and was early illustrated by lewenhoek who first observed the numerous small conical crystalline lenses within the exterior layer of contiguous prismatic transparent cornese in the astacus fluviatilis the epidermis in the compound eyes of crustacea passes transparent and homogeneous over the exterior surface of the thick layer of prismatic cornese which are here as in insects generally hexagonal but sometimes quadrangular and to the internal ends of the prismatic cornese are applied the broad bases of the hard tapering transparent lenses which have their internal truncated apices directed to the retinal expansions of the numerous optic nerves the whole sides of these transparent conieal lenses as well as the optic nerves extending back wards from their inner ends are covered as in insects with the dark choroid pigment so that only a small pencil of light gains admission through these long narrow darkened tubes to the small aperture at the posterior truncated ends of these lenses where the optic nerves terminate as usual in their small soft retinal expansion the optic nerves through out their course in the eyeball are enveloped in the same dark pigment which coats the lenses the lenses in the crayfish and in the palcemon sulcatus are not round in their outline but foursided truncated pyramids most generally however they are regular smooth cones truncated at their interior apex and they are seen of this form even under the smooth and undivided corneas spread over the eyes of mono culi in the compound eyes of the branchipus stagnalis how ever it has been recently observed that behind the smooth surface of the corneas there are distinct round or ovate lenses supported each on the anterior end of an elongated vitreous humour this vitreous body tapers backwards to the optic nerve it is enclosed in a hyaloid membrane which embraces also the posterior half of the lens and it is entirely covered externally by a retinal expansion of the optic nerve as far as the middle of the lens thus presenting a structure similar to that lately detected in the compound eyes of several insects there are about five thousand eyes in the two com pound organs of the lobster the optic nerves in the crustacea as in insects enlarge into an optic ganglion within the globe of the compound eye from which ganglion the small filaments radiate outwards to the separate lenses of the component eyes and each minute eye appears to have a pupilar extension of the choroid around the anterior surface of its lens thus the compound eyes of the crustacea and of insects are but repetitions of the simple organs of the leech and the planaria and probably of the ocular papillae of the hydatina the medusa and the monad the mobility so re markable in the pedunculated eyes of the decapods is already perceptible in the elevation and retraction of the isolated organs of the annelides and this power of varying the direc tion of the organs is greatly en creased in the pedunculated eyes of mollusca and even of some fishes in the great deve lopment of the cornea and the lens throughout the articulated classes we observe the early perfection of the most dense and refractive parts on which the optical properties of this organ chiefly depend the organs of vision are less required and less generally developed in the slow moving or fixed molluscous animals than in the active articulated classes and they are never aggregated together to form groups of simple eyes like those of myriapods or arachnida nor compound organs like those of insects and crustacea where they occur in the acephalous mollusca they are numerous simple and separate as in worms but in the higher forms of gasteropods pteropods and cephalopods their structure is more complex and their num ber is reduced to two which are symmetrically disposed on the sides of the head as in all the vertebrated classes the tunicated animals like the cirrhopods in their adult state and like most of the entozoa fixed and buried under an opaque covering appear to be destitute of visual organs and for the same reason these organs are as little required and are wanting in most of the inhabitants of bivalve shells in the free and quick moving pectens however which swim rapidly backwards by the quick and repeated contractions of their valves there are numerous distinct pedunculated eyes placed at the bases of the palleal tentacula all around the free margins of the mantle and these have long been figured and recognised by naturalists as organs of vision common to many of the conchiferous mollusca they are placed in the most exposed and the most sensitive part of the animal and by their pedunculated character and their position beside the tentacula they resemble the eyes of gasteropods they are nearly a quarter of a line in diameter and more than fifty in number in the pecten maximus they have a round promi nent smooth cornea and contain an opaque shining choroid embracing a small crystalline lens their nerves are probably as in the gasteropods derived from the tentacular branches passing along the bases of their peduncles their forms dis tribution and structure are the same in the spondyli as in the pectens and their shining lustre in both these genera is compared to that of the emerald by poli who has given en larged views of their microscopic structure the eyes of the gasteropods are always two in number placed on the ante rior part of the body moveable and generally pedunculated some of the naked dorsibranchiate gasteropods as the eolis the doris and the glaucus appear to be destitute of these organs in the naked aplysia they appear as minute black points on the smooth surface of the neck in the pectini branchiate species they are most frequently placed on tuber cles extended from the bases of the two tentacula as seen in the annexed figure of the common cyprcea tiff res fig from the south seas where the two long tentacula a present near their bases two prominent round black and moveable eyes c c with smooth glistening transparent cornese the tentacula being extended above the mouth b and anterior to the syphon d the eyes which are raised on tubercles at some distance from the base of the long slender tentacula have a considerable range of vision above the large expanded foot g is seen the inner surface of the mantle e turned up over a portion of the shell h and covered with small ramified tentacular extensions which apprise the animal of danger from behind in some of the gasteropods as the haliotis umax helix and onchidium the peduncles of the eyes are as long as the tentacula themselves according to chiaje the doris and the thetis have pedunculated eyes and ehrenberg has observed organs of vision in the hexabranchus and the phyllidia the position of these small dark eyes at the exterior of the base of the tentacula is already represented in the buccmum undatum fig d d and in the harpa elongata fig s s where they are a little further re moved from the base and in the carinaria mediterranea fig f where the optic nerves are seen passing to them directly from the cerebral ring i the internal structure of these simple eyes of the gasteropods much re sembles that of the large ocelli of the scorpions and other arachnida in the eyes of the helix pomatia which are raised to the ends of long tubular muscular peduncles exceed ing the length of the tentacula swammerdam observed a thin aqueous humour a more consistent vitreous humour a pupil and iris and a distinct crystalline lens and in the eyes of the cyclostomum viviparum as well as in that anato mised by swammerdam a distinct crystalline lens a coloured choroid coat and also an iris were detected and described by stiebel the structure of the eye in the helix pomatia and in the murex tritonis has also been described and represented by muller fig the eye of this helix a a is attached to one side of a large moveable bulb a b and presents a compressed crystalline lens b a a thin aqueous fluid and a larger vitreous body b b covered by the dark choroid coat this ocular bulb a b with its attached eye a can be extended from or retracted into the sheath of its tubular peduncle and is supplied with a large nerve a d which gives off the optic a c as is done by the tentacular branch in most other gasteropods a similar bulb is seen attached to the eyes in some other mollusca fig a c blainville ob served a large crystalline lens in the eye of the voluta cym bium which projected anteriorly like that of a sepia a small pupilar opening of the choroid behind the transparent skin which formed a distinct convex corneee over the organ and two small muscles behind for the motion of this sessile eye a similar structure nearly was found by muller in the large eyes of the murex tritonis fig c d e where they occupy their most frequent position at the outer part of the base of the tentacula c a in a few of the gastero pods they are placed on the inner part of the base of the tentacula the delicate skin of the tentaculum c a forms a thin transparent cornea c b over the eye and leaves a considerable chamber for the thin aqueous fluid anterior to the iris d b and the pupil d a the eye is lengthened in the direction of its visual axis and the black circular iris c d d b continued from the coloured choroid presents a large round pupil directed obliquely outwards from the base of the tentaculum the interior of the large cavity surrounded by the choroid and its pigment appears to be chiefly occupied by the irregular round pellucid ambercoloured mass of the crystalline lens e and the optic nerve c e which comes off from the common tentacular nerve enters the eyeball ob liquely on the outside of the axis of vision the organs of vision two in number and placed on the sides of the head in the pteropods though small in their dimensions have pro bably an internal structure similar to that found in most of the gasteropods the position of these organs is seen in the cymbulia of peron fig c and in the clio of the south seas fig j a b they are also obvious on the head of the cleodora in the cephalopodous animals these organs pre sent the greatest size and the most complicated structure met with in any of the invertebrated classes and they are even of great size in proportion to the magnitude of the head and to the general bulk of the body as in the higher crustacea and in some of the gasteropods and cartilaginous fishes the eyes are sometimes pedunculated in the animals of this class as in the nautilus and the loligopsis fig a c and they already present distinct external muscles for their movements and palpebral folds of the surrounding skin which passes transparent like a conjunctiva over their anterior surface to form a smooth cornea as in other mollusca like the eyes of fishes they are generally flattened in front from the defici ency of aqueous humour and they are of great size from the magnitude of the optic ganglion fig c c which is greater than the brain c a and from the glandu lar masses c e e contained within the outer layer of the choroid and the thickened posterior portion of the sclerotic c b behind the retina and the inner layer of the choroid as in the eyes of fishes but a small part therefore of these large organs is occupied with the trans parent optical apparatus and their movements are nearly as limited as those of a murex or a buccinum there is a rudi ment of the membrana nectitans or third eyelid so gene rally developed in the vertebrated classes and the eyelids like the iris are still almost motionless the ciliary pro cesses as in the higher cartilaginous fishes are remarkable for their great development and the crystalline lens for its double structure and its great posterior convexity it occu pies two thirds of the axal diameter of the eye in most of the naked cephalopods and consists of two planoconvex hemi spheres of unequal size applied to each other by their flat surfaces the vitreous humour of a thin fluid consistence is enclosed in a distinct cellular hyaloid membrane and the soft loose pigment of the inner layer of the choroid is gene rally of a deep purple colour in the loligo there is a small aperture on the surface leading to the glandular cavity of the eye like a lachrymal pore the retina of the cephalopods is placed as in other animals within or anterior to the pigment and the inner layer of the choroid as shown long since by chiaje and the crystalline lens is composed of concentric layers of minute transparent fibres like that of vertebrated animals thus in the isolated organs of vision of the mollus cous classes we constantly observe a crystalline lens and transparent parts anterior to the optic nerves as in the higher articulata and in the general plan of their formation and the higher complexity of their structure they form a nearer approach to the ordinary condition of these organs in fishes and higher vertebrated classes the eyes are two in number and symmetrically disposed on the sides of the head in all the vertebrated classes and nearly in all the species and the differences which they pre sent relate chiefly to the density of the media through which the various animals receive the rays of light and the extent of development of the external protecting parts of these delicate organs from the imperfect development of the nervous system of fishes and the obscurity of the element through which they move their organs of vision are of great size and from the density of the watery medium around them they have little necessity for aqueous humour in the eye and their cornea is flat to preserve the eye of fishes flat in front the sclerotic is thickened and consolidated as in the cetacea and it is also to prevent its assuming the spherical form in birds by the equal pressure of the contained fluids that the sclerotic is there strengthened with osseous plates which pre serve the tubular form of the eye and the great convexity of the cornea in that class this thickness of the sclerotic coat and the presence of the choroid gland and adipose substance between the layers of the choroid coat behind and the flat ness of the cornea in front shorten very much the visual axis of the eye and diminish the space for containing the vitreous humour hence a completely spherical form and great size and density of the crystalline lens are here required to bring the rays of light more quickly to a focus as seen in the eye of the perch fig a e the crystalline lens is composed as in other classes of minute transparent fibres which are disposed in concentric layers and variously united by their serrated edges the layers encreasing in density from the surface to the centre of the lens the diameter of the lens a e is often greater than that of the aqueous and the vitreous humours and concentrates the rays of light to a focus before the retina so as to form an inverted image on that membrane the conjunctiva is now more easily sepa rated from the cornea than in the cephalopods and the choroid and retina are here remarkable for the distinctness of the coats of which they are composed their eyelids are still as rudimentary as in the cephalopods and the liquid element around them is their only lacrymal as well as their salivary fluid the pupil is large in fishes and the iris is almost motionless the outer layer of the choroid passes with its shining pearly lustre over the front of the iris and the dark inner layer lines the posterior surface of the uvea this inner layer forms a kind of pecten passing obliquely forwards to the lens but without the pigment which covers it in birds the ciliary ligament is always present but the ciliary processes are rarely developed and the foramen centrale is not perceptible in the axis of vision the eyes are generally quite lateral in their direction and notwith standing the great irregularity of their outward form the sphericity of the retina is generally preserved by the glandu lar and adipose substances interposed behind between the layers of the choroid coat the sclerotic is easily perceived to be continuous with the sheath of
