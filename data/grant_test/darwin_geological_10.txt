in the cliffs and steep banks of rivers and that until lately they excited no attention amongst the inhabitants i am firmly convinced that a deep trench could not be cut in any line across the pampas without intersecting the remains of some quadruped it is difficult to form an opinion in what part of the pampas they are most numerous in a limited spot they could not well have been more numerous than they were at p alta the number however lately found by señor f muniz near luzan in a central spot in the pampas is extraordinarily great at the end of this chapter i will give a list of all the localities at which i have heard of remains having been discovered very frequently the remains consist of almost perfect skeletons but there are also numerous single bones as for instance at st fé their state of preservation varies much even when embedded near each other i saw none others so perfectly preserved as the heads of the toxodon and mylodon from the white soft earthy bed on the sarandis in banda oriental it is remarkable that in two limited sections i found no less than five teeth separately embedded and i heard of teeth having been similarly found in other parts may we suppose that the skeletons or heads were for a long time gently drifted by currents over the soft muddy bottom and that the teeth occasionally here and there dropped out it may be naturally asked where did these numerous animals live from the remarkable discoveries of mm lund and clausen it appears that some of the species found in the pampas inhabited the highlands of brazil the mastodon andium is embedded at great heights in the cordillera from north of the equator to at least as far south as tarija and as there is no higher land there can be little doubt that this mastodon must have lived on the plains and valleys of that great range these countries however appear too far distant for the habitation of the individuals entombed in the pampas we must probably look to nearer points for instance to the province of corrientes which as already remarked is said not to be covered by the pampean formation and may therefore at the period of its deposition have existed as dry land i have already given my reasons for believing that the animals embedded at m hermoso and at p alta in bahia blanca lived on adjoining land formed of parts of the already elevated pampean deposit with respect to the food of these many great extinct quadrupeds i will not repeat the facts given in my journal second edit p showing that there is no correlation between the luxuriance of the vegetation of a country and the size of its mammiferous inhabitants i do not doubt that large animals could now exist as far as the amount not kind of vegetation is concerned on the sterile plains of bahia blanca and of the r negro as well as on the equally if not more sterile plains of southern africa the climate however may perhaps have somewhat deteriorated since the mammifers embedded at bahia blanca lived there for we must not infer from the continued existence of the same shells on the present coasts that there has been no change in climate for several of these shells now range northward along the shores of brazil where the most luxuriant vegetation flourishes under a tropical temperature with respect to the extinction which at first fills the mind with astonishment of the many great and small mammifers of this period i may also refer to the work above cited second edit p in which i have endeavoured to show that however unable we may be to explain the precise cause we ought not properly to feel more surprised at a species becoming extinct than at one being rare and yet we are accustomed to view the rarity of any particular species as an ordinary event not requiring any extraordinary agency the several mammifers embedded in the pampean formation which mostly belong to extinct genera and some even to extinct families or orders and which differ nearly if not quite as much as do the eocene mammifers of europe from living quadrupeds having existed contemporaneously with mollusca all still inhabiting the adjoining sea is certainly a most striking fact it is however far from being an isolated one for during the late tertiary deposits of britain an elephant rhinoceros and hippopotamus coexisted with many recent land and freshwater shells and in north america we have the best evidence that a mastodon elephant megatherium megalonyx mylodon an extinct horse and ox likewise coexisted with numerous land freshwater and marine recent shells the enumeration of these extinct north american animals naturally leads me to refer to the former closer relation of the mammiferous inhabitants of the two americas which i have discussed in my journal and likewise to the vast extent of country over which some of them ranged thus the same species of the megatherium megalonyx equus as far as the state of their remains permits of identification extended from the southern united states of north america to bahia blanca in lat s on the coast of patagonia the fact of these animals having inhabited tropical and temperate regions does not appear to me any great difficulty seeing that at the cape of good hope several quadrupeds such as the elephant and hippopotamus range from the equator to lat south the case of the mastodon andium is one of more difficulty for it is found from lat s over as i have reason to believe nearly the whole of brazil and up the cordillera to regions which according to m dorbigny border on perpetual snow and which are almost destitute of vegetation undoubtedly the climate of the cordillera must have been different when the mastodon inhabited it but we should not forget the case of the siberian mammoth and rhinoceros as showing how severe a climate the larger pachydermata can endure nor overlook the fact of the guanaco ranging at the present day over the hot low deserts of peru the lofty pinnacles of the cordillera and the damp forestclad land of southern tierra del fuego the puma also is found from the equator to the strait of magellan and i have seen its footsteps only a little below the limits of perpetual snow in the cordillera of chile at the period so recent in a geological sense when these extinct mammifers existed the two americas must have swarmed with quadrupeds many of them of gigantic size for besides those more particularly referred to in this chapter we must include in this same period those wonderfully numerous remains some few of them specifically and others generically related to those of the pampas discovered by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil finally the facts here given show how cautious we ought to be in judging of the antiquity of a formation from even a great amount of difference between the extinct and living species in any one class of animalswe ought even to be cautious in accepting the general proposition that change in organic forms and lapse of time are at all

little to the details given by m dorbigny on the sandstone formation of this district the cliffs to the south of the river are about feet in height and are composed of sandstone of various tints and degrees of hardness one layer which thinned out at both ends consisted of earthy matter of a pale reddish colour with some gypsum and very like i speak after comparison of the specimens brought home pampean mud above this was a layer of compact marly rock with dendritic manganese many blocks of a conglomerate of pumicepebbles embedded in hard sandstone were strewed at the foot of the cliff and had evidently fallen from above a few miles ne of the town i found low down in the sandstone a bed a few inches in thickness of a white friable harshfeeling sediment which adheres to the tongue is of easy fusibility and of little specific gravity examined under the microscope it is seen to be pumiceous tuff formed of broken transparent crystals in the cliffs south of the river there is also a thin layer of nearly similar nature but finer grained and not so white it might easily have been mistaken for a calcareous tuff but it contains no lime this substance precisely resembles a most widely extended and thick formation in southern patagonia hereafter to be described and which is remarkable for being partially formed of infusoria these beds conjointly with the conglomerate of pumice are interesting as showing the nature of the volcanic action in the cordillera during this old tertiary period in a bed at the base of the southern cliffs m dorbigny found two extinct freshwater shells namely a unio and chilina this bed rested on one with bones of an extinct rodent namely the megamys patagoniensis and this again on another with extinct marine shells according to m dorbigny the sandstone extends westward along the coast as far as port s antonio and up the r negro far into the interior northward i traced it to the southern side of the rio colorado where it forms a low denuded plain this formation though contemporaneous with that of the rest of patagonia is quite different in mineralogical composition being connected with it only by the one thin white layer this difference may be reasonably attributed to the sediment brought down in ancient times by the rio negro by which agency also we can understand the presence of the freshwater shells and of the bones of land animals judging from the identity of four of the above shells this formation is contemporaneous as remarked by m dorbigny with that under the pampean deposit in entre rios and in banda oriental the gravel capping the sandstone plain with its calcareous cement and nodules of gypsum is probably from the reasons given in the eighth chapter contemporaneous with the uppermost beds of the pampean formation on the upper plain north of the colorado san josefmy examination here was very short the cliffs are about feet high the lower third consists of yellowishbrown soft slightly calcareous muddy sandstone parts of which when struck emit a fetid smell in this bed the great ostrea patagonica often marked with dendritic manganese and small corallines were extraordinarily numerous the four first of these species occur at st fé in entre rios and the two first in the sandstone of the rio negro above this fossiliferous mass there is a stratum of very finegrained pale brown mudstone including numerous laminæ of selenite all the strata appear horizontal but when followed by the eye for a long distance they are seen to have a small easterly dip on the surface we have the porphyritic gravel and on it sand with recent shells nuevo gulffrom specimens and notes given me by lieut stokes it appears that the lower bed consists of soft muddy sandstone like that of s josef with many imperfect shells including the pecten paranensis dorbig casts of a turritella and scutella on this there are two strata of the pale brown mudstone also like that of s josef separated by a darker coloured more argillaceous variety including the ostrea patagonica prof ehrenberg has examined this mudstone for me he finds in it three already known microscopic organisms enveloped in a finegrained pumiceous tuff which i shall have immediately to describe in detail specimens brought to me from the uppermost bed north of the rio chupat consist of this same substance but of a whiter colour tertiary strata such as are here described appear to extend along the whole coast between the rio chupat and port desire except where interrupted by the underlying claystone porphyry and by some metamorphic rocks these hard rocks i may add are found at intervals over a space of about five degrees of latitude from point union to a point between port s julian and s cruz and will be described in the ensuing chapter many gigantic specimens of the ostrea patagonica were collected in the gulf of st george port desirea good section of the lowest fossiliferous mass about forty feet in thickness resting on claystone porphyry is exhibited a few miles south of the harbour the fossiliferous strata where not denuded are conformably covered by a considerable thickness of the finegrained pumiceous mudstone divided into two masses the lower half is very finegrained slightly unctuous and so compact as to break with a semiconchoidal fracture though yielding to the nail it includes laminæ of selenite the upper half precisely resembles the one layer at the rio negro and with the exception of being whiter the upper beds at san josef and nuevo gulf in neither mass is there any trace to the naked eye of organic forms taking the entire deposit it is generally quite white or yellowish or feebly tinted with green it is either almost friable under the finger or as hard as chalk it is of easy fusibility of little specific gravity is not harsh to the touch adheres to the tongue and when breathed on exhales a strong aluminous odour it sometimes contains a very little calcareous matter and traces besides the included laminæ of gypsum under the microscope according to prof ehrenberg it consists of minute triturated cellular glassy fragments of pumice with some broken crystals in the minute glassy fragments prof ehrenberg recognises organic structures which have been affected by volcanic heat in the specimens from this place and from port s julian he finds sixteen polygastrica and twelve phytolitharia of these organisms seven are new forms the others being previously known all are of marine and chiefly of oceanic origin this deposit to the naked eye resembles the crust which often appears on weathered surfaces of feldspathic rocks it likewise resembles those beds of earthy feldspathic matter sometimes interstratified with porphyritic rocks as is the case in this very district with the underlying purple claystone porphyry from examining specimens under a common microscope and comparing them with other specimens undoubtedly of volcanic origin i had come to the same conclusion with prof ehrenberg namely that this great deposit in its first origin is of volcanic nature port s julianon the south side of the harbour the following section which i here repeat gives the nature of the beds seen in the cliffs of the ninety feet plain beginning at the topst the earthy mass a a including the remains of the macrauchenia with recent shells on the surface nd the porphyritic shingle b which in its lower part is interstratified owing i believe to redeposition during denudation with the white pumiceous mudstone rd this white mudstone about twenty feet in thickness and divided into two varieties c and d both closely resembling the lower finegrained more unctuous and compact kind at port desire and as at that place including much selenite th a fossiliferous mass divided into three main beds of which the uppermost is thin and consists of ferruginous sandstone with many shells of the great oyster and pecten paranensis the middle bed e is a yellowish earthy sandstone abounding with scutellæ and the lowest bed f is an indurated greenish sandy clay including large concretions of calcareous sandstone many shells of the great oyster and in parts almost made up of fragments of balanidæ at the head of the inner harbour of port s julian the fossiliferous mass is not displayed and the seacliffs from the waters edge to a height of between and feet are formed of the white pumiceous mudstone which here includes innumerable farextended sometimes horizontal sometimes inclined or vertical laminæ of transparent gypsum often about an inch in thickness further inland with the exception of the superficial gravel the whole thickness of the truncated hills which represent a formerly continuous plain feet in height appears to be formed of this white mudstone here and there however at various heights thin earthy layers containing the great oyster pecten paranensis and turritella ambulacrum are interstratified thus showing that the whole mass belongs to the same epoch i nowhere found even a fragment of a shell actually in the white deposit and only a single cast of a turritella out of the eighteen microscopic organisms discovered by ehrenberg in the specimens from this place ten are common to the same deposit at port desire i may add that specimens of this white mudstone with the same identical characters were brought me from two pointsone twenty miles north of s julian where a wide gravelcapped plain feet in height is thus composed and the other forty miles south of s julian where on the old charts the cliffs are marked as chalk hills santa cruzthe gravelcapped cliffs at the mouth of the river are feet in height the lower part to a thickness of fifty or sixty feet consists of a more or less hardened darkish muddy or argillaceous sandstone like the lowest bed of port desire containing very many shells some silicified and some converted into yellow calcareous spar the great oyster is here numerous in layers the trigonocelia and turritella are also very numerous it is remarkable that the pecten paranensis so common in all other parts of the coast is here absent the upper part of the cliff is generally divided into three great strata differing slightly in composition but essentially resembling the pumiceous mudstone of the places farther north the deposit however here is more arenaceous of greater specific gravity and not so white it is interlaced with numerous thin veins partially or quite filled with transverse fibres of gypsum these fibres were too short to reach across the vein have their extremities curved or bent in the same veins with the gypsum and likewise in separate veins as well as in little nests there is much powdery sulphate of magnesia as ascertained by mr reeks in an uncompressed form i believe that this salt has not heretofore been found in veins of the three beds the central one is the most compact and more like ordinary sandstone it includes numerous flattened spherical concretions often united like a necklace composed of hard calcareous sandstone containing a few shells some of these concretions were four feet in diameter and in a horizontal line nine feet apart showing that the calcareous matter must have been drawn to the centres of attraction from a distance of four feet and a half on both sides in the upper and lower finergrained strata there were other concretions of a grey colour containing calcareous matter and so finegrained and compact as almost to resemble porcelainrock i have seen exactly similar concretions in a volcanic tufaceous bed in chiloe although in this upper finegrained strata organic remains were very rare yet i noticed a few of the great oyster and in one included soft ferruginous layer there were some specimens of the cucullæa alta found at port desire in the lower fossiliferous mass and of the mactra rugata which latter shell has been partially converted into gypsum in ascending the valley of the s cruz the upper strata of the coastcliffs are prolonged with nearly the same characters for fifty miles at about this point they begin in the most gradual and scarcely perceptible manner to be banded with white lines and after ascending ten miles farther we meet with distinct thin layers of whitish greenish and yellowish finegrained fusible sediments at eighty miles from the coast in a cliff thus composed there were a few layers of ferruginous sandstone and of an argillaceous sandstone with concretions of marl like those in the pampas at miles from the coast that is at a central point between the atlantic and the cordillera we have the preceding section the upper half of the sedimentary mass under the basaltic lava consists of innumerable zones of perfectly white bright green yellowish and brownish finegrained sometimes incoherent sedimentary matter the white pumiceous trachytic tufflike varieties are of rather greater specific gravity than the pumiceous mudstone on the coast to the north some of the layers especially the browner ones are coarser so that the broken crystals are distinguishable with a weak lens the layers vary in character in short distances with the exception of a few of the ostrea patagonica which appeared to have rolled down from the cliff above no organic remains were found the chief difference between these layers taken as a whole and the upper beds both at the mouth of the river and on the coast northward seems to lie in the occasional presence of more colouring matter and in the supply having been intermittent these characters as we have seen very gradually disappear in descending the valley and this fact may perhaps be accounted for by the currents of a more open sea having blended together the sediment from a distant and intermittent source the coloured layers in the foregoing section rest on a mass apparently of great thickness but much hidden by the talus of soft sandstone almost composed of minute pebbles from onetenth to twotenths of an inch in diameter of the rocks with the entire exception of the basaltic lava composing the great boulders on the surface of the plain and probably composing the neighbouring cordillera five miles higher up the valley and again thirty miles higher up that is twenty miles from the nearest range of the cordillera the lower plain included within the upper escarpments is formed as seen on the banks of the river of a nearly similar but finergrained more earthy laminated sandstone alternating with argillaceous beds and containing numerous moderately sized pebbles of the same rocks and some shells of the great ostrea patagonica as most of these shells had been rolled before being here embedded their presence does not prove that the sandstone belongs to the great patagonian tertiary formation for they might have been redeposited in it when the valley existed as a seastrait but as amongst the pebbles there were none of basalt although the cliffs on both sides of the valley are composed of this rock i believe that the sandstone does belong to this formation at the highest point to which we ascended twenty miles distant from the nearest slope of the cordillera i could see the horizontally zoned white beds stretching under the black basaltic lava close up to the mountains so that the valley of the s cruz gives a fair idea of the constitution of the whole width of patagonia basaltic lava of the s cruzthis formation is first met with sixtyseven miles from the mouth of the river thence it extends uninterruptedly generally but not exclusively on the northern side of the valley close up to the cordillera the basalt is generally black and finegrained but sometimes grey and laminated it contains some olivine and high up the valley much glassy feldspar where also it is often amygdaloidal it is never highly vesicular except on the sides of rents and on the upper and lower spherically laminated surfaces it is often columnar and in one place i saw magnificent columns each face tweleve feet in width with their interstices filled up with calcareous tuff the streams rest conformably on the white sedimentary beds but i nowhere saw the actual junction nor did i anywhere see the white beds actually superimposed on the lava but some way up the valley at the foot of the uppermost escarpments they must be thus superimposed moreover at the lowest point down the valley where the streams thin out and terminate in irregular projections the spaces or intervals between these projections are filled up to the level of the now denuded and gravelcapped surfaces of the plains with the whitezoned sedimentary beds proving that this matter continued to be deposited after the streams had flowed hence we may conclude that the basalt is contemporaneous with the upper parts of the great tertiary formation the lava where first met with is feet in thickness it there consists of two three or perhaps more streams divided from each other by vesicular spheroids like those on the surface from the streams having as it appears extended to different distances the terminal points are of unequal heights generally the surface of the basalt is smooth but in one part high up the valley it was so uneven and hummocky that until i afterwards saw the streams extending continuously on both sides of the valley up to a height of about feet close to the cordillera i thought that the craters of eruption were probably close at hand this hummocky surface i believe to have been caused by the crossing and heaping up of different streams in one place there were several rounded ridges about twenty feet in height some of them as broad as high and some broader which certainly had been formed whilst the lava was fluid for in transverse sections each ridge was seen to be concentrically laminated and to be composed of imperfect columns radiating from common centres like the spokes of wheels the basaltic mass where first met with is as i have said feet in thickness and thirtyfive miles higher up the valley it increases to feet in the first fourteen and a half miles of this distance the upper surface of the lava judging from three measurements taken above the level of the river of which the apparently very uniform inclination has been calculated from its total height at a point miles from the mouth slopes towards the atlantic at an angle of only this must be considered only as an approximate measurement but it cannot be far wrong taking the whole thirtyfive miles the upper surface slopes at an angle of but this result is of no value in showing the inclination of any one stream for halfway between the two points of measurement the surface suddenly rises between and feet apparently caused by some of the uppermost streams having extended thus far and no farther from the measurements made at these two points thirtyfive miles apart the mean inclination of the sedimentary beds over which the lava has flowed is now after elevation from under the sea only for the sake of comparison it may be mentioned that the bottom of the present sea in a line from the mouth of the s cruz to the falkland islands from a depth of seventeen fathoms to a depth of eightyfive fathoms declines at an angle of between the beach and the depth of seventeen fathoms the slope is greater from a point about halfway up the valley the basaltic mass rises more abruptly towards the foot of the cordillera namely from a height of feet to about feet above the sea this great deluge of lava is worthy in its dimensions of the great continent to which it belongs the aggregate streams have flowed from the cordillera to a distance unparalleled i believe in any case yet known of about geographical miles near their furthest extremity their total thickness is feet which increase thirtyfive miles farther inland as we have just seen to feet the least inclination given by m e de beaumont of the upper surface of a lava stream namely is that of the great subaërial eruption in from skaptar jukul in iceland and m e de beaumont shows that it must have flowed down a mean inclination of less than but we now see that under the pressure of the sea successive streams have flowed over a smooth bottom with a mean inclination not more than and that the upper surface of the terminal portion over a space of fourteen and a half miles has an inclination of not more than if the elevation of patagonia has been greater nearer the cordillera than near the atlantic as is probable then these angles are now all too large i must repeat that although the foregoing measurements which were all carefully taken with the barometer may not be absolutely correct they cannot be widely erroneous southward of the s cruz the cliffs of the feet plain extend to coy inlet and owing to the naked patches of the white sediment they are said on the charts to be like the coast of kent at coy inlet the high plain trends inland leaving flattopped outliers at port gallegos lat and ninety miles south of s cruz i am informed by captain sulivan r n that there is a gravelcapped plain from to feet in height formed of numerous strata some finegrained and palecoloured like the upper beds at the mouth of the s cruz others rather darker and coarser so as to resemble gritstones or tuffs these latter include rather large fragments of apparently decomposed volcanic rocks there are also included layers of gravel this formation is highly remarkable from abounding with mammiferous remains which have not as yet been examined by professor owen but which include some large but mostly small species of pachydermata edentata and rodentia from the appearance of the palecoloured finegrained beds i was inclined to believe that they corresponded with the upper beds of the s cruz but professor ehrenberg who has examined some of the specimens informs me that the included microscopical organisms are wholly different being fresh and brackish water forms hence the to feet plain at port gallegos is of unknown age but probably of subsequent origin to the great patagonian tertiary formation eastern tierra del fuegojudging from the height the general appearance and the white colour of the patches visible on the hill sides the uppermost plain both on the north and western side of the strait of magellan and along the eastern coast of tierra del fuego as far south as near port st polycarp probably belongs to the great patagonian tertiary formation these higher tableranges are fringed by low irregular extensive plains belonging to the boulder formation and composed of coarse unstratified masses sometimes associated as north of c virgins with fine laminated muddy sandstones the cliffs in sebastian bay are feet in height and are composed of fine sandstones often in curvilinear layers including hard concretions of calcareous sandstone and layers of gravel in these beds there are fragments of wood legs of crabs barnacles encrusted with corallines still partially retaining their colour imperfect fragments of a pholas distinct from any known species and of a venus approaching very closely to but slightly different in form from the v lenticularis a species living on the coast of chile leaves of trees are numerous between the laminæ of the muddy sandstone they belong as i am informed by dr j d hooker to three species of deciduous beech different from the two species which compose the great proportion of trees in this forestclad land from these facts it is difficult to conjecture whether we here see the basal part of the great patagonian formation or some later deposit summary on the patagonian tertiary formationfour out of the seven fossil shells from st fé in entre rios were found by m dorbigny in the sand stone of the rio negro and by me at san josef three out of the six from san josef are identical with those from port desire and s julian which two places have together fifteen species out of which three are common to both santa cruz has seventeen species out of which five are common to port desire and s julian considering the difference in latitude between these several places and the small number of species altogether collected namely thirtysix i conceive the above proportional number of species in common is sufficient to show that the lower fossiliferous mass belongs nearly i do not say absolutely to the same epoch what this epoch may be compared with the european tertiary stages m dorbigny will not pretend to determine the thirtysix species including those collected by myself and by m dorbigny are all extinct or at least unknown but it should be borne in mind that the present coast consists of shingle and that no one i believe has dredged here for shells hence it is not improbable that some of the species may hereafter be found living some few of the species are closely related with existing ones this is especially the case according to m dorbigny and mr sowerby with the fusus patagonicus and according to mr sowerby with the pyrula the venus meridionalis the crepidula gregaria and the turritella ambulacrum and t patagonica at least three of the genera namely cucullæa crassatella and as determined by mr sowerby struthiolaria are not found in this quarter of the world and trigonocelia is extinct the evidence taken altogether indicates that this great tertiary formation is of considerable antiquity but when treating of the chilian beds i shall have to refer again to this subject the white pumiceous mudstone with its abundant gypsum belongs to the same general epoch with the underlying fossiliferous mass as may be inferred from the shells included in the intercalated layers at neuvo gulf s julian and s cruz out of the twentyseven marine microscopic structures found by prof ehrenberg in the specimens from s julian and port desire ten are common to these two places the three found at neuvo gulf are distinct i have minutely described this deposit from its remarkable characters and its wide extension from coy inlet to port desire a distance of miles it is certainly continuous and i have reason to believe that it likewise extends to the rio chupat neuvo gulf and san josef a distance of miles we have also seen that a single layer occurs at the rio negro at port s julian it is from to feet in thickness and at s cruz it extends with a slightly altered character up to the cordillera from its microscopic structure and from its analogy with other formations in volcanic districts it must be considered as originally of volcanic origin it may have been formed by the longcontinued attrition of vast quantities of pumice or judging from the manner in which the mass becomes in ascending the valley of s cruz divided into variously coloured layers from the longcontinued eruption of clouds of fine ashes in either case we must conclude that the southern volcanic orifices of the cordillera now in a dormant state were at about this period over a wide space and for a great length of time in action we have evidence of this fact in the latitude of the rio negro in the sandstoneconglomerate with pumice and demonstrative proof of it at s cruz in the vast deluges of basaltic lava at this same tertiary period also there is distinct evidence of volcanic action in western banda oriental the patagonian tertiary formation extends continuously judging from fossils alone from s cruz to near the rio colorado a distance of above miles and reappears over a wide area in entre rios and banda oriental making a total distance of miles but this formation undoubtedly extends though no fossils were collected far south of the s cruz and according to m dorbigny miles north of st fé at s cruz we have seen that it extends across the continent being on the coast about feet in thickness and rather more at s julian and rising with the contemporaneous lavastreams to a height of about feet at the base of the cordillera it rests wherever any underlying formation can be seen on plutonic and metamorphic rocks including the newer pampean deposit and those strata in eastern tierra del fuego of doubtful age as well as the boulder formation we have a line of more than twentyseven degrees of latitude equal to that from the straits of gibraltar to the south of iceland continuously composed of tertiary formations throughout this great space the land has been upraised without the strata having been in a single instance as far as my means of observation went unequally tilted or dislocated by a fault tertiary formations on the west coast chonos archipelagothe numerous islands of this group with the exception of lemus ypun consist of metamorphic schists these two islands are formed of softish grey and brown fusible often laminated sandstones containing a few pebbles fragments of black lignite and numerous mammillated concretions of hard calcareous sandstone in the northern parts of this group there are some cliffs of gravel and of the boulder formation in the southern part at p andres in tres montes there is a volcanic formation probably of tertiary origin the lavas attain a thickness of from to feet they are extremely variable in colour and nature being compact or brecciated or cellular or amygdaloidal with zeolite agate and bole or porphyritic with glassy albitic feldspar there is also much imperfect rubbly pitchstone with the interstices charged with powdery carbonate of lime apparently of contemporaneous origin these lavas are conformably associated with strata of breccia and of brown tuff containing lignite the whole mass has been broken up and tilted at an angle of by a series of great volcanic dikes one of which was thirty yards in breadth this volcanic formation resembles one presently to be described in chiloe huafothis island lies between the chonos and chiloe groups it is about feet high and perhaps has a nucleus of metamorphic rocks the strata which i examined consisted of finegrained muddy sandstones with fragments of lignite and concretions of calcareous sandstone chiloethis fine island is about miles in length the entire southern part and the whole western coast consists of micaschist which likewise is seen in the ravines of the interior the central mountains rise to a height of feet and are said to be partly formed of granite and greenstone there are two small volcanic districts the eastern coast and large parts of the northern extremity of the island are composed of gravel the boulder formation and underlying horizontal strata the latter are well displayed for twenty miles north and south of castro they vary in character from common sandstone to finegrained laminated mudstones all the specimens which i examined are easily fusible and some of the beds might be called volcanic gritstones these latter strata are perhaps related to a mass of columnar trachyte which occurs behind castro the sandstone occasionally includes pebbles and many fragments and layers of lignite of the latter some are apparently formed of wood and others of leaves one layer on the nw side of lemuy is nearly two feet in thickness there is also much silicified wood both common dicotyledonous and coniferous a section of one specimen in the direction of the medullary rays has as i am informed by mr r brown the discs in a double row placed alternately and not opposite as in the true araucaria i found marine remains only in one spot in some concretions of hard calcareous sandstone in several other districts i have observed that organic remains were exclusively confined to such concretions are we to account for this fact by the supposition that the shells lived only at these points or is it not more probable that their remains were preserved only where concretions were formed at the northern extremity of the island near s carlos there is a large volcanic formation between and feet in thickness the commonest lava is blackishgrey or brown either vesicular or amygdaloidal with calcareous spar and bole most even of the darkest varieties fuse into a palecoloured glass the next commonest variety is a rubbly rarely well characterised pitchstone fusing into a white glass which passes in the most irregular manner into stony gray lavas this pitchstone as well as some purple claystone porphyry certainly flowed in the form of streams these various lavas often pass at a considerable depth from the surface in the most abrupt and singular manner into wacke great masses of the solid rock are brecciated and it was generally impossible to discover whether the recementing process had been an igneous or aqueous action the beds are obscurely separated from each other they are sometimes parted by seams of tuff and layers of pebbles in one place they rested on and in another place were capped by tuffs and gritstones apparently of submarine origin the neighbouring peninsula of lacuy is almost wholly formed of tufaceous deposits connected probably in their origin with the volcanic hills just described the tuffs are palecoloured alternating with laminated mudstones and sandstones all easily fusible and passing sometimes into fine grained white beds strikingly resembling the great upper infusorial deposit of patagonia and sometimes into brecciolas with pieces of pumice in the last stage of decay these again pass into ordinary coarse breccias and conglomerates of hard rocks within very short distances some of the finer tuffs often passed into each other in a peculiar manner namely by irregular polygonal concretions of one variety increasing so much and so suddenly in size that the second variety instead of any longer forming the entire mass was left merely in thin veins between the concretions on the left hand the lower part aa consists of regular alternating strata of brown tuffs and greenish laminated mudstone gently inclined to the right and conformably covered by a mass b left of a white tufaceous and brecciolated deposit on the right hand the whole cliff bb right consists of the same white tufaceous matter which on this side presents scarcely a trace of stratification but to the left becomes very gradually and rather indistinctly divided into strata quite conformable with the underlying beds aa moreover a few hundred yards farther to the left where the surface has been less denuded the tufaceous strata b left are conformably covered by another set of strata like the underlying ones aa of this section in the middle of the diagram the beds aa are seen to be abruptly cut off and to abut against the tufaceous nonstratified mass but the line of junction has been accidentally not represented steep enough for i particularly noticed that before the beds had been tilted to the right this line must have been nearly vertical it appears that a current of water cut for itself a deep and steep submarine channel and at the same time or afterwards filled it up with the tufaceous and brecciolated matter and spread the same over the surrounding submarine beds the matter becoming stratified in these more distant and less troubled parts and being moreover subsequently covered up by other strata like a a not shown in the diagram it is singular that three of the beds of a a are prolonged in their proper direction as represented beyond the line of junction into the white tufaceous matter the prolonged portions of two of the beds are rounded in the third the terminal fragment has been pushed upwards how these beds could have been left thus prolonged i will not pretend to explain in another section on the opposite side of a promontory there was at the foot of this same line of junction that is at the bottom of the old submarine channel a pile of fragments of the strata a a with their interstices filled up with the white tufaceous matter this is exactly what might have been anticipated under such circumstances the various tufaceous and other beds at this northern end of chiloe probably belong to about the same age with those near castro and they contain as there many fragments of black lignite and of silicified and pyritous wood often embedded close together they also contain many and singular concretions some are of hard calcareous sandstone in which it would appear that broken volcanic crystals and scales of mica have been better preserved as in the case of the organic remains near castro than in the surrounding mass other concretions in the white brecciola are of a hard ferruginous yet fusible nature they are as round as cannonballs and vary from two or three inches to two feet in diameter their insides generally consist either of fine scarcely coherent volcanic sand or of an argillaceous tuff in this latter case the external crust was quite thin and hard some of the spherical balls were encircled in the line of their equators by a necklacelike row of smaller concretions again there were other concretions irregularly formed and composed of a hard compact ashcoloured stone with an almost porcelainous fracture adhesive to the tongue and without any calcareous matter these beds are also interlaced by many veins containing gypsum ferruginous matter calcareous spar and agate it was here seen with remarkable distinctness how intimately concretionary action and the production of fissures and veins are related together the following diagram is an accurate representation of a horizontal space of tuff about four feet long by two and a half in width the double lines represent the fissures partially filled with oxide of iron and agate the curvilinear lines show the course of the innumerable concentric concretionary zones of different shades of colour and of coarseness in the particles of tuff the symmetry and complexity of the arrangement gave the surface an elegant appearance it may be seen how obviously the fissures determine or have been determined by the shape sometimes of the whole concretion and sometimes only of its central parts the fissures also determine the curvatures of the long undulating zones of concretionary action from the varying composition of the veins and concretions the amount of chemical action which the mass has undergone is surprisingly great and it would likewise appear from the difference in size in the particles of the concretionary zones that the mass also has been subjected to internal mechanical movements in the peninsula of lacuy the strata over a width of four miles have been upheaved by three distinct and some other indistinct lines of elevation ranging within a point of north and south one line about feet in height is regularly anticlinal with the strata dipping away on both sides at an angle of from a central valley of elevation about yards in width a second narrow steep ridge only sixty feet high is uniclinal the strata throughout dipping westward those on both flanks being inclined at an angle of from ten to fifteen degrees whilst those on the ridge dip in the same direction at an angle of between thirty and forty degrees this ridge traced northwards dies away and the beds at its terminal point instead of dipping westward are inclined to the north this case interested me as being the first in which i found in south america formations perhaps of tertiary origin broken by lines of elevation valdivia island of mochathe formations of chiloe seem to extend with nearly the same character to valdivia and for some leagues northward of it the underlying rocks are micaceous schists and are covered up with sandstone and other sedimentary beds including as i was assured in many places layers of lignite i did not land on mocha lat but mr stokes brought me specimens of the gray finegrained slightly calcareous sandstone precisely like that of huafo containing lignite and numerous turritellæ the island is flat topped feet in height and appears like an outlier of the sedimentary beds on the mainland concepcionsailing northward from valdivia the coastcliffs are seen first to assume near the r tolten and thence for miles northward to be continued with the same mineralogical characters immediately to be described at concepcion i heard in many places of beds of lignite some of it fine and glossy and likewise of silicified wood near the tolten the cliffs are low but they soon rise in height and the horizontal strata are prolonged with a nearly level surface until coming to a more lofty tract between points rumena and lavapie here the beds have been broken up by at least eight or nine parallel lines of elevation ranging e or ene and w or wsw these lines can be followed with the eye many miles into the interior they are all uniclinal the strata in each dipping to a point between s and sse with an inclination in the central lines of about forty degrees and in the outer ones of under twenty degrees this band of symmetrically troubled country is about eight miles in width the island of quiriquina in the bay of concepcion is formed of various soft and often ferruginous sandstones with bands of pebbles and with the lower strata sometimes passing into a conglomerate resting on the underlying metamorphic schists these beds include subordinate layers of greenish impure clay soft micaceous and calcareous sandstones and reddish friable earthy matter with white specks like decomposed crystals of feldspar they include also hard concretions fragments of shells lignite and silicified wood in the upper part they pass into white soft sediments and brecciolas very like those described at chiloe as indeed is the whole formation at lirguen and other places on the eastern side of the bay there are good sections of the lower sandstones which are generally ferruginous but which vary in character and even pass into an argillaceous nature they contain hard concretions fragments of lignite silicified wood and pebbles of the same rocks with the pebbles in the sandstones of quiriquina and they alternate with numerous often very thin layers of imperfect coal generally of little specific gravity the main bed here is three feet thick and only the coal of this one bed has a glossy fracture another irregular curvilinear bed of brown compact lignite is remarkable for being included in a mass of coarse gravel these imperfect coals when placed in a heap ignite spontaneously the cliffs on this side of the bay as well as on the island of quiriquina are capped with red friable earth which as stated in the ninth chapter is of recent formation the stratification in this neighbourhood is generally horizontal but near lirguen the beds dip nw at an angle of near concepcion they are also inclined at the northern end of quiriquina they have been tilted at an angle of and at the southern end at angles varying from to these dislocations must have taken place under the sea a collection of shells from the island of quiriquina has been described by m dorbigny during a second visit of the beagle to concepcion mr kent collected for me some silicified wood and shells out of the concretions in the sandstone from tome situated a short distance north of lirguen besides these shells captain belcher found here an ammonite nearly three feet in diameter and so heavy that he could not bring it away fragments are deposited at haslar hospital he also found the silicified vertebræ of some very large animal from the identity in mineralogical nature of the rocks and from captain belchers minute discription of the coast between lirguen and tome the fossiliferous concretions at this latter place certainly belong to the same formation with the beds examined by myself at lirguen and these again are undoubtedly the same with the strata of quiriquina moreover the three first of the shells from tome though associated in the same concretions with the baculite are identical with the species from quiriquina hence all the sandstone and lignitiferous beds in this neighbourhood certainly belong to the same formation although the generic character of the quiriquina fossils naturally led m dorbigny to conceive that they were of tertiary origin yet as we now find them associated with the baculites vagina and with an ammonite we must in the opinion of m dorbigny and if we are guided by the analogy of the northern hemisphere rank them in the cretaceous system moreover the baculites vagina which is in a tolerable state of preservation appears to professor e forbes certainly to be identical with a species so named by him from pondicherry in india where it is associated with numerous decidedly cretaceous species which approach most nearly to lower greensand or neocomian forms this fact considering the vast distance between chile and india is truly surprising again the nautilus dorbignyanus as far as its imperfect state allows of comparison resembles as i am informed by professor forbes both in its general form and in that of its chambers two species from the upper greensand it may be added that every one of the abovenamed genera from quiriquina which have an apparently tertiary character are found in the pondicherry strata there are however some difficulties on this view of the formations at concepcion being cretaceous which i shall afterwards allude to and i will here only state that the cardium auca is found also at coquimbo the beds at which place there can be no doubt are tertiary navidadthe concepcion formation extends some distance northward but how far i know not for the next point at which i landed was at navidad miles north of concepcion and miles south of valparaiso the cliffs here are about feet in height they consist wherever i could examine them of finegrained yellowish earthy sandstones with ferruginous veins and with concretions of hard calcareous sandstone in one part there were many pebbles of the common metamorphic porphyries of the cordillera and near the base of the cliff i observed a single rounded boulder of greenstone nearly a yard in diameter i traced this sandstone formation beneath the superficial covering of gravel for some distance inland the strata are slightly inclined from the sea towards the cordillera which apparently has been caused by their having been accumulated against or round outlying masses of granite of which some points project near the coast the sandstone contains fragments of wood either in the state of lignite or partially silicified sharks teeth and shells in great abundance both high up and low down the seacliffs pectunculus and oliva were most numerous in individuals and next to them turritella and fusus i collected in a short time though suffering from illness the following thirtyone species all of which are extinct and several of the genera do not now range as we shall hereafter show nearly so far south coquimbofor more than miles northward of navidad the coast consists of plutonic and metamorphic rocks with the exception of some quite insignificant superficial beds of recent origin at tonguay twentyfive miles south of coquimbo tertiary beds recommence i have already minutely described in the ninth chapter the stepformed plains of coquimbo and the upper calcareous beds from twenty to thirty feet in thickness containing shells of recent species but in different proportions from those on the beach there remains to be described only the underlying ancient tertiary beds represented in the following diagram here given again by the letters f and e i obtained good sections of bed f only in herradura bay it consists of soft whitish sandstone with ferruginous veins some pebbles of granite and concretionary layers of hard calcareous sandstone these concretions are remarkable from the great number of large silicified bones apparently of cetaceous animals which they contain and likewise of a sharks teeth closely resembling those of the carcharias megalodon shells of the following species of which the gigantic oyster and perna are the most conspicuous are numerously embedded in the concretions the cliffs on one side of herradura bay are capped by a mass of stratified shingle containing a little calcareous matter and i did not doubt that it belonged to the same recent formation with the gravel on the surrounding plains also cemented by calcareous matter until to my surprise i found in the midst of it a single thin layer almost entirely composed of the above gigantic oyster at a little distance inland i obtained several sections of the bed e which though different in appearance from the lower bed f belongs to the same formation it consists of a highly ferruginous sandy mass almost composed like the lowest bed at port s julian of fragments of balanidæ it includes some pebbles and layers of yellowishbrown mudstone the uppermost layers of this ferruginosandy mass are conformably covered by and impregnated to the depth of several inches with the calcareous matter of the bed d called losa hence i at one time imagined that there was a gradual passage between them but as all the species are recent in the bed d whilst the most characteristic shells of the uppermost layers of e are the extinct perna pecten and monoceros i agree with m dorbigny that this view is erroneous and that there is only a mineralogical passage between them and no gradual transition in the nature of their organic remains besides the fourteen species enumerated from these two lower beds m dorbigny has described ten other species given to him from this locality of these twentyfour shells all are extinct except according to mr sowerby the artemis ponderosa mytilus chiloensis and probably the great balanus coquimbo to copiapoa few miles north of coquimbo i met with the ferruginous balaniferous mass e with many silicified bones i was informed that these silicified bones occur also at tonguay south of coquimbo their number is certainly remarkable and they seem to take the place of the silicified wood so common on the coastformations of southern chile in the valley of chañeral i again saw this same formation capped with the recent calcareous beds i here left the coast and did not see any more of the tertiary formations until descending to the sea at copiapo here in one place i found variously coloured layers of sand and soft sandstone with seams of gypsum and in another place a comminuted shelly mass with layers of rottenstone and seams of gypsum including many of the extinct gigantic oyster beds with these oysters are said to occur at english harbor a few miles north of copiapo coast of peruwith the exception of deposits containing recent shells and of quite insignificant dimensions no tertiary formations have been observed on this coast for a space of twentytwo degrees of latitude north of copiapo until coming to payta where there is said to be a considerable calcareous deposit a few fossils have been described by m dorbigny from this place concluding remarksthe formations described in this chapter have in the case of chiloe and probably in that of concepcion and navidad apparently been accumulated in troughs formed by submarine ridges extending parallel to the ancient shores of the continent in the ease of the islands of mocha and huafo it is highly probable and in that of ypun and lemus almost certain that they were accumulated round isolated rocky centres or nuclei in the same manner as mud and sand is now collecting round the outlying islets and reefs in the west indian archipelago hence i may remark it does not follow that the outlying tertiary masses of mocha and huafo were ever continuously united at the same level with the formations on the mainland though
