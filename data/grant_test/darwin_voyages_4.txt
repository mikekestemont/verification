the eye can reach to the east and west the sand hillocks resting on the clay allow small pools of water to collect and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable supply of fresh water the great advantage arising from depressions and elevations of the soil is not often brought home to the mind the two miserable springs in the long passage between the rio negro and colorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain without them not a drop of water would have been found the belt of sanddunes is about eight miles wide at some former period it probably formed the margin of a grand estuary where the colorado now flows in this district where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land occur such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one although merely considering the physical geography of the country having crossed the sandy tract we arrived in the evening at one of the posthouses and as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we determined to pass the night there the house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two hundred feet higha most remarkable feature in this country this posta was commanded by a negro lieutenant born in africa to his credit be it said there was not a rancho between the colorado and buenos ayres in nearly such neat order as his he had a little room for strangers and a small corral for the horses all made of sticks and reeds he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case of being attacked this would however have been of little avail if the indians had come but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the thought of selling his life dearly a short time before a body of indians had travelled past in the night if they had been aware of the posta our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been slaughtered i did not any where meet a more civil and obliging man than this negro it was therefore the more painful to see that he would not sit down and eat with us in the morning we sent for the horses very early and started for another exhilarating gallop we passed the cabeza del buey an old name given to the head of a large marsh which extends from bahia blanca here we changed horses and passed through some leagues of swamps and saltpetre marshes changing horses for the last time we again began wading through the mud my animal fell and i was well soused in black mirea very disagreeable accident when one does not possess a change of clothes some miles from the fort we met a man who told us that a great gun had been fired which is a signal that indians are near we immediately left the road and followed the edge of a marsh which when chased offers the best mode of escape we were glad to arrive within the walls when we found all the alarm was about nothing for the indians turned out to be friendly ones who wished to join general rosas bahia blanca scarcely deserves the name of a village a few houses and the barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified wall the settlement is only of recent standing since and its growth has been one of trouble the government of buenos ayres did not follow the wise example of the spanish viceroys in purchasing the land from the indians as they did with the rio negro but unjustly occupied it by force hence the need of the fortifications hence the few houses and little cultivated land without the limits of the walls even the cattle are not safe from the attacks of the indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the fortress stands the part of the harbour where the beagle intended to anchor being distant twentyfive miles i obtained from the commandant a guide and horses to take me to see whether she had arrived leaving the plain of green turf which followed the course of the little brook we soon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand saline marshes or bare mud some parts were clothed by low thickets and others with those succulent plants which luxuriate only where salt abounds bad as the country was ostriches deer cavies and armadilloes were abundant my guide told me that two months before he had a most narrow escape of his life he was out hunting at no great distance from this part of the country with two other men when they were suddenly met by a party of indians who giving chase soon overtook and killed his two friends his own horses legs were also caught by the bolas but he jumped off and with his knife cut them free while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse and received two severe wounds from their chuzos springing on the saddle he managed by a most wonderful exertion just to keep ahead of the long spears of his pursuers who followed him to within sight of the fort from that time there was an order that no one should stray far from the settlement i did not know of this when i started and was surprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer which appeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter we found the beagle had not arrived and consequently set out on our return but the horses soon tiring we were obliged to bivouac on the plain in the morning we had caught an armadillo which although a most excellent dish when roasted in its shell did not make a very substantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men the ground at the place where we stopped for the night was incrusted with a layer of glauber salt and hence of course was without water yet many of the smaller rodents managed to exist even here and the tucutuco was making its odd little grunt beneath my head during half the night our horses were very poor ones and in the morning they were soon exhausted from not having had any thing to drink so that we were obliged to walk about noon the dogs killed a kid which we roasted i eat some of it but it made me intolerably thirsty this was the more distressing as the road from some recent rain was full of little puddles of clear water yet not a drop was drinkable i had scarcely been twenty hours without water and only part of the time under a hot sun yet the thirst rendered me very weak how people survive two or three days under such circumstances i cannot imagine at the same time i must confess that my guide did not suffer at all and was astonished that one days deprivation should be so troublesome to me i have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being incrusted with salt this phenomenon is quite different from that of the salinas and much more extraordinary in many parts of south america wherever the climate is moderately dry these incrustations occur but i have nowhere seen them so abundant as near bahia blanca the salt here consists of a large proportion of sulphate of soda mixed with a very little of the common muriate as long as the ground remains moist in these salitrales as the spaniards improperly call them mistaking this substance for saltpetre nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain composed of a black muddy soil supporting scattered tufts of succulent plants i was therefore much surprised after a weeks hot weather when i first saw square miles of country that i had previously ridden over in the former condition white as if from a slight fall of snow which the wind had heaped up into partial drifts this latter appearance is chiefly due to the tendency which the salt has to crystallize like hoarfrost round the blades of grass stumps of wood or on the top of the broken ground in lieu of the bottoms of the puddles of water the salinas as a general rule occur in depressions on the more elevated plains the salitrales either on level tracts elevated a few feet above the level of the sea and appearing as if lately inundated or on alluvial land bordering rivers in this latter case although i am not absolutely certain i have strong reasons for believing that the salt is often removed by the waters of the river and is again reproduced several circumstances incline me to think that the black muddy soil generates the sulphate of soda the whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists what can be more singular than thus to see square miles of country thinly crusted over with glauber salt it may be asked whether plants do not decompose the muriate of soda but whence comes the sulphuric acid in peru nitrate of soda occurs in beds far thicker than these of the sulphate both cases are equally mysterious i suspect that as a general rule the salts of soda are infinitely more common in south america than those of potash two days afterwards i again rode to the harbour but to a nearer part of it when not far from our destination my companion the same man as before spied three people hunting on horseback he immediately dismounted and watching them intently said they dont ride like christians and nobody can leave the fort the three hunters joined company and likewise dismounted from their horses at last one mounted again and rode over the hill out of sight my companion said we must now get on our horses load your pistol and he looked to his own sword i asked are they indiansquien sabe who knows if there are no more than three it does not signify it then struck me that the one man had gone over the hill to fetch the rest of his tribe i suggested this but all the answer i could extort was quien sabe his head and eye never for a minute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon i thought his uncommon coolness too good a joke and asked him why he did not return home i was startled when he answered we are returning but in a line so as to pass near a swamp into which we can gallop the horses as far as they can go and then trust to our own legs so that there is no danger i did not feel quite so confident of this and wanted to increase our pace he said no not until they do when any little inequality concealed us we galloped but when in sight continued walking at last we reached a valley and turning to the left galloped quickly to the foot of a hill he gave me his horse to hold made the dogs lie down and then crawled on his hands and knees to reconnoitre he remained in this position for some time and at last bursting out in laughter exclaimed mugeres women he knew them to be the wife and sisterinlaw of the majors son hunting for ostrichs eggs i have described this mans conduct because he acted under the full impression that they were indians as soon however as the absurd mistake was found out he gave me a hundred reasons why they could not have been indians but all these were forgotten at the time we then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called punta alta whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of bahia blanca the wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great mudbanks which the inhabitants call cangrejales or crabberies from the number of small crabs the mud is so soft that it is impossible to walk over them even for the shortest distance many of the banks have their surfaces covered with long rushes the tops of which alone are visible at high water on one occasion when in a boat we were so entangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way nothing was visible but the flat beds of mud the day was not very clear and there was much refraction or as the sailors expressed it things loomed high the only object within our view which was not level was the horizon rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air and water like mudbanks and mudbanks like water we passed the night in punta alta and i employed myself in searching for fossil bones this point being a perfect catacomb for monsters of extinct races the evening was perfectly calm and clear the extreme monotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of mudbanks and gulls sandhillocks and solitary vultures in riding back in the morning we came across a very fresh track of a puma but did not succeed in finding him we saw also a couple of zorillos or skunksodious animals which are far from uncommon in general appearance the zorillo resembles a polecat but it is rather larger and much thicker in proportion conscious of its power it roams by day about the open plain and fears neither dog nor man if a dog is urged to the attack its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the fetid oil which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose whatever is once polluted by it is for ever useless azara says the smell can be perceived at a league distant more than once when entering the harbour of monte video the wind being off shore we have perceived the odour on board the beagle

snake toad lizard hybernation of animals habits of seapen indian wars and massacres arrowhead antiquarian relic bahia blanca the beagle arrived on the th of august and a week afterwards sailed for the plata with captain fitzroys consent i was left behind to travel by land to buenos ayres i will here add some observations which were made during this visit and on a previous occasion when the beagle was employed in surveying the harbour not much can be made out respecting the geology at the distance of some miles inland an escarpment of a great argillaceocalcareous formation of rock extends the space near the coast consists of plains of hardened mud and broad bands of sanddunes which present appearances that can easily be accounted for by a rise of the land and of this phenomenon although to a trifling amount we have other proofs at punta alta a low cliff about twenty feet high exposes a mass of partly consolidated shingle irregularly interstratified with a reddish muddy clay and containing numerous recent shells we may believe a similar accumulation would now take place on any point where tides and waves were opposed in the gravel a considerable number of bones were embedded mr owen who has undertaken the description of these remains has not yet examined them with care but the following list may give some idea of their nature st a tolerably perfect head of a megatherium and a fragment and teeth of two others d an animal of the order edentata as large as a pony and with great scratching claws d and th two great edentata related to the megatherium and both fully as large as an ox or horse th another equally large animal closely allied or perhaps identical with the toxodon hereafter to be described which had very flat grinding teeth somewhat resembling those of a rodent th a large piece of the tesselated covering like that of the armadillo but of gigantic size th a tusk which in its prismatic form and in the disposition of the enamel closely resembles that of the african boar it is probable that it belonged to the same animal with the singular flat grinders lastly a tooth in the same state of decay with the others its broken condition does not allow mr owen without further comparison to come to any definite conclusion but the part that is perfect resembles in every respect the tooth of the common horse all these remains were found embedded in a beach which is covered at spring tides and the space in which they were collected could not have exceeded one hundred and fifty yards square it is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species should be found together and it proves how numerous in kind the ancient inhabitants of this country must have been at the distance of about thirty miles in another cliff of red earth i found several fragments of bones among them were the teeth of a rodent much narrower but even larger than those of the hydrochærus capybara the animal which has been mentioned as exceeding in dimensions every existing member of its order there was also part of the head of a ctenomys the species being different from the tucutuco but with a close general resemblance the remains at punta alta were associated as before remarked with shells of existing species these have not as yet been examined with scrupulous care but it may be safely asserted that they are most closely similar to the species now living in the same bay it is also very remarkable that not only the species but the proportional numbers of each kind are nearly the same with those now cast up on the pebble beaches there are eleven marine species some in an imperfect state and one terrestrial if i had not collected living specimens from the same bay some of the fossils would have been thought extinct for mr sowerby who was kind enough to look at my collection had not previously seen them we may feel certain that the bones have not been washed out of an older formation and embedded in a more recent one because the remains of one of the edentata were lying in their proper relative position and partly so in a second case which could not have happened without the carcass had been washed to the spot where the skeleton is now entombed we here have a strong confirmation of the remarkable law so often insisted on by mr lyell namely that the longevity of the species in the mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the testacea when we proceed to the southern part of patagonia i shall have occasion to describe the case of an extinct camel from which the same result may be deduced from the shells being littoral species including one terrestrial and from the character of the deposit we may feel absolutely certain that the remains were embedded in a shallow sea not far from the coast from the position of the skeleton being undisturbed and likewise from the fact that fullgrown serpulæ were attached to some of the bones we know that the mass could not have been accumulated on the beach itself at the present time part of the bed is daily washed by the tide while another part has been raised a few feet above the level of the sea hence we may infer that the elevation has here been trifling since the period when the mammalia now extinct were living this conclusion is in harmony with several other considerations such as the recent character of the beds underlying the pampas deposit but which i have not space in this work to enter on from the general structure of the coast of this part of south america we are compelled to believe that the changes of level have all at least of late been in one direction and that they have been very gradual if then we look back to the period when these quadrupeds lived the land probably stood at a level less elevated only by a few fathoms than at present therefore its general configuration since that epoch cannot have been greatly modified a conclusion which certainly would be drawn from the close similarity in every respect between the shells now living in the bay as well as in the case of the one terrestrial species with those which formerly lived there the surrounding country as may have been gathered from this journal is of a very desert character trees nowhere occur and only a few bushes which are chiefly confined to depressions among the sandhillocks or to the borders of the saline marshes here then is an apparent difficulty we have the strongest evidence that there has occurred no great physical change to modify the features of the country yet in former days numerous large animals were supported on the plains now covered by a thin and scanty vegetation that large animals require a luxuriant vegetation has been a general assumption which has passed from one work to another i do not hesitate however to say that it is completely false and that it has vitiated the reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the ancient history of the world the prejudice has probably been derived from india and the indian islands where troops of elephants noble forests and impenetrable jungles are associated together in every account if on the other hand we refer to any work of travels through the southern parts of africa we shall find allusions in almost every page either to the desert character of the country or to the numbers of large animals inhabiting it the same thing is rendered evident by the many sketches which have been published of various parts of the interior when the beagle was at cape town i rode a few leagues into the country which at least was sufficient to render that which i had read more fully intelligible dr andrew smith who at the head of his adventurous party has so lately succeeded in passing the tropic of capricorn informs me that taking into consideration the whole of the southern part of africa there can be no doubt of its being sterile country on the southern and southeastern coasts there are some fine forests but with these exceptions the traveller may pass for days together through open plains covered by a poor and scanty vegetation it is difficult to convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility but it may be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one time by great britain exceeds perhaps even tenfold the quantity on an equal area in the interior parts of southern africa the fact that bullockwaggons can travel in any direction excepting near the coast without more than occasionally half an hours delay gives perhaps a more definite notion of its scantiness now if we look to the animals inhabiting these wide plains we shall find their numbers extraordinarily great and their bulk immense we must enumerate the elephant three species of rhinoceros and as dr smith is convinced two others also the hippopotamus giraffe the bos cafferas large as a fullgrown bull and the elanbut little less two zebras and the quaccha two gnus and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals it may be supposed that although the species are numerous the individuals of each kind are few by the kindness of dr smith i am enabled to show that the case is very different he informs me that in lat in one days march with the bullockwaggons he saw without wandering to any great distance on either side between one hundred and one hundred and fifty rhinoceroses which belonged to three species that the same day he saw several herds of giraffes amounting together to nearly a hundred and that although no elephant was observed yet they are found in this district at the distance of a little more than one hours march from their place of encampment on the previous night his party actually killed at one spot eight hippopotamoses and saw many more in this same river there were likewise crocodiles of course it was a case quite extraordinary to see so many great animals crowded together but it evidently proves that they must exist in great numbers dr smith describes the country passed through that day as being thinly covered with grass and bushes about four feet high and still more thinly with mimosatrees the waggons were not prevented travelling in a nearly direct line besides these large animals every one the least acquainted with the natural history of the cape has read of the herds of antelopes which can be compared only to flocks of migratory birds the numbers indeed of the lion panther and hyæna and the multitude of birds of prey plainly tell of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds as dr smith remarked to me the carnage each day in southern africa must indeed be terrific i confess it is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in a country producing so little food the larger quadrupeds no doubt roam over wide extents in search of it and their food chiefly consists of underwood which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk dr smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth no sooner is a part consumed than its place is supplied by a fresh stock i apprehend however that our ideas respecting the quantity necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are exaggerated it should have been remembered that the camel an animal of no mean bulk has always been considered as the emblem of the desert the belief that where large quadrupeds exist the vegetation must necessarily be luxuriant is the more remarkable because the converse is far from true mr burchell observed to me that when entering brazil nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the south american vegetation contrasted with that of south africa together with the absence of all large quadrupeds in his travels he has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights if there were sufficient data of an equal number of the largest herbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious if we take on the one side the elephant hippopotamus giraffe bos caffer elan certainly three species of rhinoceros and probably five and on the other side two tapirs the guanaco three deer the vicuna peccari capybara after which we must choose from the monkeys to complete the number and then place these two groups alongside each other it is not easy to conceive ranks more disproportionate after the above facts we are compelled to conclude against anterior probability that among the mammalia there exists no close relation between the bulk of the species and the quantity of the vegetation in the countries they inhabit with regard to the number of large quadrupeds there certainly exists no quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with southern africa after the different statements which have been given the extremely desert character of that region will not be disputed in the european division of the world we must look back to the tertiary epochs to find a condition of things among the mammalia resembling that which is now found at the cape of good hope that tertiary epoch which we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with large animals because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at certain spots could boast of but few more of the large quadrupeds than southern africa does at present if we speculate on the condition of the vegetation during that epoch we are at least bound so far to consider existing analogies as not to urge as absolutely necessary a luxuriant vegetation when we see a state of things so totally different in the region to which we refer we know that the extreme regions of north america many degrees beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains perpetually congealed are covered by forests of large and tall trees in a like manner in siberia we have woods of birch fir aspen and larch growing in a latitude where the mean temperature of the air falls below the freezing point and where the earth is so completely frozen that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is perfectly preserved with these facts we must grant as far as quantity alone of vegetation is concerned that the great quadrupeds of the later tertiary epochs might in most parts of northern europe and asia have lived on the spots where their remains are now found i do not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their support because as there is evidence of physical changes and as the animals have become extinct so may we suppose that the species of plants have likewise been changed these remarks directly bear on the case of the siberian animals preserved in ice the firm conviction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical luxuriance to support such large animals and the impossibility of reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation was one chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate and of overwhelming catastrophes which were invented to account for their entombment i am far from supposing that the climate has not changed since the period when those animals lived which now lie buried in the ice at present i only wish to show that as far as quantity of food alone is concerned the ancient rhinoceroses might have roamed over the steppes of central siberia the northern parts probably being under water even in their present condition as well as the living rhinoceroses and elephants over the karros of southern africa after our long digression if we return to the case of the fossil animals at bahia blanca there is a difficulty from our not knowing on what food the great edentata probably lived if on insects and larvæ like their nearest representatives the armadilloes and anteaters there is an end to all conjecture but as vegetation is the first source of life in every part of the world i think we may safely conclude that the country around bahia blanca with a very little increase of fertility would support large animals the plains of the rio negro thickly scattered over with thorny bushes i do not doubt would supply sufficient food equally well with the karros of africa as there is evidence of a physical change to a small amount so may we allow it to be probable that the productiveness of the soil has decreased in an equally small degree with this concession i apprehend every difficulty is removed on the other hand if we imagine a luxuriant vegetation to be necessary for the support of these animals we become involved in a series of contradictions and improbabilities as the notices of the remains of several quadrupeds which i discovered in south america are scattered in different parts of this volume i will here give a catalogue of them after having enlarged on the diminutive size of the present races it may be of interest to see that formerly a very different order of things prevailed first the megatherium and the four or five other large edentata already alluded to th an immense mastodon which must have abounded over the whole country th the horse i do not now refer to the broken tooth at bahia blanca but to more certain evidence th the toxodon an extraordinary animal as large as a hippopotamus th a fragment of the head of an animal larger than a horse and of a very singular character th th and th parts of rodents one of considerable size lastly a llama or guanaco fully as large as the camel all these animals coexisted during an epoch which geologically speaking is so recent that it may be considered as only just gone by these remains have been presented to the college of surgeons where they are now in the hands of those best qualified to appreciate whatever value they may possess i will now give an account of the habits of some of the more interesting birds which are common on these wild plains and first of the struthio rhea or south american ostrich this bird is well known to abound over the plains of northern patagonia and the united provinces of la plata it has not crossed the cordillera but i have seen it within the first range of mountains on the uspallata plain elevated between six and seven thousand feet the ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one they feed on vegetable matter such as roots and grass but at bahia blanca i have repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive mudbanks which are then dry for the sake as the gauchos say of catching small fish although the ostrich in its habits is so shy wary and solitary and although so fleet in its pace it falls a prey without much difficulty to the indian or gaucho armed with the bolas when several horsemen appear in a semicircle it becomes confounded and does not know which way to escape they generally prefer running against the wind yet at the first start they expand their wings and like a vessel make all sail on one fine hot day i saw several ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes where they squatted concealed till quite closely approached it is not generally known that ostriches readily take to the water mr king informs me that at the bay of san blas and at port valdes in patagonia he saw these birds swimming several times from island to island they ran into the water both when driven down to a point and likewise of their own accord when not frightened the distance crossed was about yards when swimming very little of their bodies appear above water and their necks are extended a little forward their progress is slow on two occasions i saw some ostriches swimming across the santa cruz river where its course was about four hundred yards wide and the stream rapid captain sturt when descending the murrumbidgee in australia saw two emus in the act of swimming the inhabitants who live in the country readily distinguish even at a distance the cock bird from the hen the former is larger and darkercoloured and has a bigger head the ostrich i believe the cock emits a singular deeptoned hissing note when first i heard it standing in the midst of some sandhillocks i thought it was made by some wild beast for it is a sound that one cannot tell whence it comes or from how far distant when we were at bahia blanca in the months of september and october the eggs in extraordinary numbers were found all over the country they either lie scattered single in which case they are never hatched and are called by the spaniards huachos or they are collected together into a shallow excavation which forms the nest out of the four nests which i saw three contained twentytwo eggs each and the fourth twentyseven in one days hunting on horseback sixtyfour eggs were found fortyfour of these were in two nests and the remaining twenty scattered huachos the gauchos unanimously affirm and there is no reason to doubt their statement that the male bird alone hatches the eggs and for some time afterwards accompanies the young the cock when on the nest lies very close i have myself almost ridden over one it is asserted that at such times they are occasionally fierce and even dangerous and that they have been known to attack a man on horseback trying to kick and leap on him my informer pointed out to me an old man whom he had seen much terrified by one chasing him i observe in burchells travels in south africa that he remarks having killed a male ostrich and the feathers being dirty it was said by the hottentots to be a nest bird i understand that the male emu in the zoological garden takes charge of the nest this habit therefore is common to the family the gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest i have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been seen to go in the middle of the day one after the other to the same nest i may add also that it is believed in africa that two females lay in one nest although this habit at first appears very strange i think the cause may be explained in a simple manner the number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty and even to fifty and according to azara to seventy or eighty now although it is most probable from the number of eggs found in one district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to that of the parent birds and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen that she may in the course of the season lay a large number yet the time required must be very long azara states that a female in a state of domestication laid seventeen eggs each at the interval of three days one from another if the hen were obliged to hatch her own eggs before the last was laid the first probably would be addled but if each laid a few eggs at successive periods in different nests and several hens as is stated to be the case combined together then the eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age if the number of eggs in one of these nests is as i believe not greater on an average than the number laid by one female in the season then there must be as many nests as females and each cock bird will have its fair share of the labour of incubation and that during a period when the females could not sit on account of not having finished laying i have before mentioned the great numbers of huachos or scattered eggs so that in one days hunting the third part were found in this state it appears odd that so many should be wasted does it not arise from the difficulty of several females associating together and persuading an old cock to undertake the office of incubation it is evident that there must at first be some degree of association between at least two females otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plains at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into one nest some have believed that the scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to feed on this can hardly be the case in america because the huachos although oftentimes found addled and putrid are generally whole when at the rio negro in northern patagonia i repeatedly heard the gauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called avestruz petise they described it as being less than the common ostrich which is there abundant but with a very close general resemblance they said its colour was dark and mottled and that its legs were shorter and feathered lower down than those of the common ostrich it is more easily caught by the bolas than the other species the few inhabitants who had seen both kinds affirmed they could distinguish them apart from a long distance the eggs of the small species appeared however more generally known and it was remarked with surprise that they were very little less than those of the rhea but of a slightly different form and with a tinge of pale blue some eggs picked up on the plains of patagonia agree pretty well with this description and i do not doubt are those of the petise this species occurs most rarely on the plains bordering the rio negro but about a degree and a half further south they are tolerably abundant one gaucho however said he distinctly recollected having seen one many years before near the mouth of the rio colorado which is to the north of the rio negro they are said to prefer the plains near the sea when at port desire in patagonia lat mr martens shot an ostrich and i looked at it forgetting at the moment in the most unaccountable manner the whole subject of the petises and thought it was a twothird grown one of the common sort the bird was cooked and eaten before my memory returned fortunately the head neck legs wings many of the larger feathers and a large part of the skin had been preserved from these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together and is now exhibited in the museum of the zoological society mr gould who in describing this new species did me the honour of calling it after my name states that besides the smaller size and different colour of the plumage the beak is of considerably less proportional dimensions than in the common rhea that the tarsi are covered with differentlyshaped scales and that they are feathered six inches beneath the knee in this latter respect and in the broader feathers of the wing this bird perhaps shows more affinity to the gallinaceous family than any other of the struthionidæ among the patagonian indians in the strait of magellan we found a half indian who had lived some years with the tribe but had been born in the northern provinces i asked him if he had ever heard of the avestruz petise he answered by saying why there are none others in these southern countries he informed me that the number of eggs in the nest of the petise is considerably less than with the other kind namely not more than fifteen on an average but he asserted that more than one female deposited them at santa cruz we saw several of these birds they were excessively wary i think they could see a person approaching when he was so far off as not to distinguish the ostrich in ascending the river few were seen but in our quiet and rapid descent many in pairs and by fours or fives were observed it was remarked and i think with truth that this bird did not expand its wings when first starting at full speed after the manner of the northern kind the fact of these ostriches swimming across the river has been mentioned in conclusion i may repeat that the struthio rhea inhabits the country of la plata as far as a little south of the rio negro in lat and that the petise takes its place in southern patagonia the part about the rio negro being neutral territory wallis saw ostriches at batchelors river lat in the strait of magellan which must be the extreme southern possible range of the petise m dorbigny when at the rio negro made great exertions to procure this bird but never had the good fortune to succeed he mentions it in his travels and proposes in case i presume of a specimen being obtained to call it rhea pennata a fuller notice was given long before in dobrizhoffers account of the abipones ad he says you must know moreover that emus differ in size and habits in different tracts of land for those that inhabit the plains of buenos ayres and tucuman are larger and have black white and gray feathers those near to the strait of magellan are smaller and more beautiful for their white feathers are tipped with black at the extremity and their black ones in like manner terminate in white a very singular little bird lately described by st hilaire and lesson under the name of tinochorus eschscholtzii is here common in its habits general appearance and structure it nearly equally partakes of the character of a quail and a snipe yet these two birds are widely contrasted in the form of their beaks wings and legs the tinochorus is found in the whole of southern south america wherever there are sterile plains or open dry pastureland we saw it as far south as the inland plains of patagonia at santa cruz in lat on the western side of the cordillera near concepcion where the forest land changes into an open country this bird is found from that point throughout chile as far as copiapó it frequents the most desolate places where scarcely another living creature can exist they are found either in pairs or small flocks of five or six but near the sierra ventana i saw as many as thirty or forty together upon being approached they squat close and then are very difficult to be distinguished so that they often rise quite unexpectedly when feeding they walk rather slowly with their legs wide apart they dust themselves in roads and sandy places they frequent particular spots and may be found there day after day when a pair are together if one is shot the other seldom rises for these birds like partridges only take wing in a flock in all these respects in the muscular gizzard adapted for vegetable food in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils short legs and form of foot the tinochorus has a close affinity with quails but directly the bird is seen flying ones opinion is changed the long pointed wings so different from those in the gallinaceous order the irregular manner of flight and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of rising recal the idea of a snipe the sportsmen of the beagle unanimously called it the shortbilled snipe to this genus or rather to that of the sandpiper it approaches as mr gould informs me in the shape of its wing the length of the scapulars the form of the tail which closely resembles that of tringa hypoleucos and in the general colour of the plumage the male bird however has a black mark on its breast in the form of a yoke which may be compared to the horseshoe on the breast of the english partridge the nest is said to be placed on the borders of lakes although the bird itself is an inhabitant of the parched desert the tinochorus is closely related to some other south american birds two species of the genus attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans in their habits one in tierra del fuego above the limits of forest land the other just beneath the snow line on the cordillera of central chile a bird of another closelyallied genus chionis alba which solitary species was long thought to form a family by itself is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions it feeds on seaweed and shells on the tidal rocks although not webfooted from some unaccountable taste it is frequently met with far out at sea this small family of birds is one of those which from its varied relations although at present offering only difficulties to the systematic naturalist ultimately may assist in revealing the grand scheme common to the present and past ages on which organized beings have been created i may also briefly notice the genus furnarius it contains several species all small birds living on the ground and inhabiting open dry countries in structure they cannot be compared to any european form ornithologists have generally included them among the creepers although opposed to that family in every habit the best known species is the common ovenbird of la plata the casara or housemaker of the spaniards and furnarius rufus of viell the nest whence it takes its name is placed in the most exposed situations as on the top of a post a bare rock or on a cactus it is composed of mud and bits of straw and has strong thick walls in shape it precisely resembles an oven or depressed beehive the opening is large and arched and directly in front within the nest there is a partition which reaches nearly to the roof thus forming a passage or antechamber to the true nest another and smaller species of furnarius something like a lark in appearance resembles the ovenbird in many points as in the general reddish tint of its plumage a peculiar shrill reiterated cry an odd manner of running by starts c from its affinity the spaniards call it casarita or little housebuilder although its nidification is quite different the casarita builds its nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole which is said to extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground several of the country people told me that when boys they had attempted to dig out the nest but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end the bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side of a road or stream here at bahia blanca the walls are built of hardened mud and i noticed that one which enclosed a courtyard where i lodged was penetrated by round holes in a score of places on asking the owner the cause of this he bitterly complained of the little casarita several of which i afterwards observed at work it is rather curious that although they were constantly flitting over the low wall they must be quite incapable of gaining an idea of thickness even after the shortest circuitous route for otherwise they would not have made so many vain attempts i do not doubt that each bird as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact i have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this country of armadilloes three species occur namely the dasypus minutus or pichy the villosus or peludo and the apar the first extends as far south as lat which is about ten degrees further than any other kind a fourth species the mulita only extends as far south as the sierra tapalguen lat which is north of bahia blanca the four species have nearly similar habits the peludo however is nocturnal while the others wander by day over the open plains feeding on beetles larvæ roots and even small snakes the apar commonly called mataco is remarkable by having only three moveable bands the rest of its tesselated covering being nearly inflexible it has the power of rolling itself into a perfect sphere like one kind of english woodlouse in this state it is safe from the attack of dogs for the dog not being able to take the whole in its mouth tries to bite one side and the ball slips away the smooth hard covering of the mataco offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog the pichy prefers a very dry soil and the sanddunes near the coast where for many months it can never taste water is its favourite resort in the course of a days ride near bahia blanca several were generally met with the instant one was perceived it was necessary in order to catch it almost to tumble off ones horse for if the soil was soft the animal burrowed so quickly that its hinder quarters had almost disappeared before one could alight the pichy likewise often tries to escape notice by squatting close to the ground it appears almost a pity to kill such nice little animals for as a gaucho said while sharpening his knife on the back of one son tan mansos they are so quiet of reptiles there are many kinds one snake a trigonocephalus or more properly a cophias from the size of the poison channel in its fangs must be very deadly cuvier in opposition to some other naturalists makes this a subgenus of the rattlesnake and intermediate between it and the viper in confirmation of this opinion i observed a fact which appears to me very curious and instructive as showing how every character even though it may be in some degree independent of structure has a tendency to vary by slow degrees the extremity of the tail of this snake is terminated by a point which is very slightly enlarged and as the animal glided along it constantly vibrated the last inch and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood produced a rattling noise which could be distinctly heard at the distance of six feet as often as the animal was irritated or surprised its tail was shaken and the vibrations were extremely rapid even as long as the body retained its irritability a tendency to this habitual movement was evident this trigonocephalus has therefore in some respects the structure of vipera with the habits of a crotalus the noise however being produced by a simpler device the expression of this snakes face was hideous and fierce the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris the jaws were broad at the base and the nose terminated in a triangular projection i do not think i ever saw any thing more ugly excepting perhaps in some of the vampire bats i imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions with respect to each other somewhat proportional to those of the human face and thus we obtain a scale of beauty amongst the batrachian reptiles i found only one little toad which was most singular from its colour if we imagine first that it had been steeped in the blackest ink and then when dry allowed to crawl over a board freshly painted with the brightest vermilion so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of its stomach a good idea of its appearance will be gained if it is an unnamed species surely it ought to be called diabolicus for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of eve instead of being nocturnal in its habits as other toads are and living in damp obscure recesses it crawls during the heat of the day about the dry sandhillocks and arid plains where not a single drop of water can be found it must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture and this probably is absorbed by the skin for it is known that these reptiles possess great powers of cutaneous absorption at maldonado i found one in a situation nearly as dry as at bahia blanca and thinking to give it a great treat carried it to a pool of water not only was the little animal unable to swim but i think without help would soon have been drowned of lizards there were many kinds but only one remarkable from its habits it lives on the bare sand near the sea coast and from its mottled colour the brownish scales being speckled with white yellowish red and dirty blue can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface when frightened it attempts to avoid discovery by feigning death with outstretched legs depressed body and closed eyes if further molested it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand this lizard from its flattened body and short legs cannot run quickly it belongs to the genus ophryessa i will here add a few remarks on the hybernation of animals in this part of south america when we first arrived at bahia blanca september th we thought nature had granted scarcely a living creature to this sandy and dry country by digging however in the ground several insects large spiders and lizards were found in a half torpid state on the th a few animals began to appear and by the th three days from the equinox every thing announced the commencement of spring the plains were ornamented by the flowers of a pink wood sorrel wild peas œnotheræ and geraniums and the birds began to lay their eggs numerous lamellicorn and heteromerous insects the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies were slowly crawling about while the saurian tribe the constant inhabitants of a sandy soil darted in every direction during the first eleven days whilst nature was dormant the mean temperature taken from observations made every two hours on board the beagle was and in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above on the eleven succeeding days in which all living things became so animated the mean was and the range in the middle of the day between sixty and seventy here then an increase of seven degrees in mean temperature but a greater one of extreme heat was sufficient to awake the functions of life at monte video from which we had just before sailed in the twentythree days included between the th of july and the th of august the mean temperature from observations was the mean hottest day being and the coldest the lowest point to which the thermometer fell was and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to or yet with this elevated temperature almost every beetle several genera of spiders snails and land shells toads and lizards were all lying torpid beneath stones but we have seen that at bahia blanca which is four degrees to the southward and therefore with a climate only a very little colder this same temperature with a rather less extreme heat was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings this shows how nicely the required degree of stimulus is adapted to the general climate of the place and how little it depends on absolute temperature it is well known that within the tropics the hybernation or more properly estivation of animals is governed by the times of drought near rio de janeiro i was at first surprised to observe that a few days after some little depressions had been changed into pools of water by the rain they were peopled by numerous fullgrown shells and beetles humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened mud he adds the indians often find enormous boas which they call uji or water serpents in the same lethargic state to reanimate them they must be irritated or wetted with water i will only mention one other animal a zoophyte allied to virgularia a kind of seapen it consists of a thin straight fleshy stem with alternate rows of polypi on each side and surrounding an elastic stony axis it varies in length from eight inches to two feet the stem at one extremity is truncate but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage which is separated into two compartments and in these small yellow spherical ova are contained the stony axis which gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter this undeveloped portion is enclosed in a transparent elastic irritable bag containing a fluid in which a very distinct circulation of particles could be seen this bag floats in one of the compartments of the fleshy terminal appendage at low water hundreds of these zoophytes might be seen projecting like stubble with the truncate end upwards a few inches above the
