we had a letter of introduction to don pedro we found him exceedingly hospitable and kind and with a degree of disinterestedness which is more common in la plata than on this side of the continent the next day don pedro procured us fresh horses and offered to accompany us himself we proceeded to the south generally following the coast and passing through several hamlets each with its large barnlike chapel built of wood near castro we saw a remarkably pretty waterfall it was very small but the water fell in a single sheet into a large circular basin around which stately trees from to feet high cast a dark shade at vilipilli don pedro asked the commandant to give us a guide to cucao the old gentleman offered to come himself but for a long time he would not believe that any thing could induce two englishmen to go to such an out of the way place as cucao we thus were accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the country as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer indians towards them at chonchi we struck off across the island and followed intricate winding paths sometimes passing through magnificent forests and then opening into pretty cleared spots abounding with corn and potato crops in this undulating woody country partially cultivated there was something which reminded me of the wilder parts of england and therefore had to my eye a most fascinating aspect at vilinco which is situated on the borders of the lake of cucao only a few fields are cleared and all the inhabitants appear to be indians this lake is twelve miles long and runs in an east and west direction from local circumstances the seabreeze blows very regularly during the day and during the night it falls calm this has given rise to strange exaggerations for the phenomenon as described to us at s carlos was quite a prodigy the road to cucao was so very bad that we determined to embark in a periagua the commandant in the most authoritative manner ordered six indians to get ready to pull us over without deigning to tell them whether they would be paid the periagua is a strange rough boat but the crew were still stranger i doubt if six uglier little men ever got into a boat together they pulled however very well and cheerfully the strokeoar gabbled indian and uttered strange cries much after the fashion of a pigdriver when driving his pigs we started with a light breeze against us but yet reached before late at night the capella de cucao the country on each side of the lake was one unbroken forest in the same periagua with us a cow was embarked to get so large an animal into a small boat appears at first a difficulty but the indians managed it in a minute they brought the cow alongside the boat which was heeled towards her then placing two oars under her belly with their ends resting on the gunwale by the aid of these levers they fairly tumbled the poor beast heels over head into the bottom of the boat and then lashed her down with ropes at cucao we found an uninhabited hovel which is the residence of the padre when he pays this capella a visit where lighting a fire we cooked our supper and were very comfortable the district of cucao is the only inhabited part on the whole west coast of chiloe it contains about thirty or forty indian families who are scattered along four or five miles of the shore they are very much secluded from the rest of chiloe and have scarcely any sort of commerce except sometimes in a little oil which they get from sealblubber they are pretty well dressed in clothes of their own manufacture and they have plenty to eat they seemed however discontented yet humble to a degree which it was quite painful to witness the former feeling is i think chiefly to be attributed to the harsh and authoritative manner in which they are treated by their rulers our companions although so very civil to us behaved to the poor indians as if they had been slaves rather than free men they ordered provisions and the use of their horses without ever condescending to say how much or indeed whether the owners should be paid at all in the morning being left alone with these poor people we soon ingratiated ourselves by presents of cigars and maté a lump of white sugar was divided between all present and tasted with the greatest curiosity the indians ended all their complaints by saying and it is only because we are poor indians and know nothing but it was not so when we had a king the next day after breakfast we road to punta huantamó a few miles to the northward the road lay along a very broad beach on which even after so many fine days a terrible surf was breaking i was assured that after a heavy gale the roar can be heard at night even at castro a distance of no less than twentyone sea miles across a hilly and wooded country we had some difficulty in reaching the point owing to the intolerably bad paths for every where in the shade the ground soon becomes a perfect quagmire the point itself is a bold rocky hill it is covered by a plant allied i believe to bromelia and called by the inhabitants chepones in scrambling through the beds our hands were very much scratched i was amused by observing the precaution our indian guide took in turning up his trousers thinking that they were more delicate than his own hard skin this plant bears a fruit in shape like an artichoke in which a number of seedvessels are packed these contain a pleasant sweet pulp here much esteemed i saw at lowes harbour the chilotans making chichi or cider with this fruit so true is it as humboldt remarks that almost every where man finds means of preparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom the savages however of tierra del fuego and i believe of australia have not advanced thus far in the arts the coast to the northward of punta huantamó is exceedingly rugged and broken and is fronted by many breakers on which the sea is eternally roaring mr king and myself were anxious to return if it had been possible on foot along this coast but even the indians said it is quite impracticable we were told that men have crossed by striking directly through the woods from cucao to s carlos but never by the coast on these expeditions the indians carry with them only toasted corn and of this they eat sparingly twice a day threembarking in the periagua we returned across the lake and then mounted our horses the whole of chiloe took advantage of this week of unusually fine weather to clear the ground by burning in every direction volumes of smoke were curling upwards although the inhabitants were so assiduous in setting fire to every part of the wood yet i did not see a single fire which they had succeeded in making extensive we dined with our friend the commandant and did not reach castro till after dark the next morning we started very early after having ridden for some time we obtained from the brow of a steep hill an extensive view and it is a rare thing on this road of the great forest over the horizon of trees the volcano of corcovado and the great flattopped one to the northward stood out in proud preeminence scarcely another peak in the long range showed its snowy top i hope it will be long before i forget this farewell view of the magnificent cordillera of chiloe at night we bivouacked under a cloudless sky and the next morning reached s carlos we arrived on the right day for before evening heavy rain commenced february thsailed from chiloe during the last week i made several short excursions one was to examine a great bed of oyster and venus shells of the same kind now living in the neighbouring bay but elevated feet measured by the barometer above the level of the sea from among these shells large foresttrees were growing another ride was to p huechucucuy i had with me a guide who knew the country far too well for he would pertinaciously tell me the indian name for every little point rivulet and creek in the same manner as in tierra del fuego the indian language appears singularly well adapted for attaching names to the most trivial divisions of the land i believe every one was glad to say farewell to chiloe yet if we could forget the gloom and ceaseless rain of winter chiloe might pass for a charming island there is also something very attractive in the simplicity and humble politeness of all the poor inhabitants we steered along shore to the northward but owing to thick weather did not reach valdivia till the night of the eighth the external features of the whole line of country were the same with the central parts of chiloe the forest was nowhere cleared away on the seacoast bold rocky points projected but further inland the older formations were covered up by plains belonging to geological periods of no great antiquity the next morning after anchoring in the fine harbour of valdivia the boat proceeded to the town which is distant about ten miles we followed the course of the river occasionally passing a few hovels and patches of ground cleared out of the otherwise unbroken forest and sometimes meeting a canoe with an indian family the town is situated on the low banks of the stream and is so completely buried in a wood of appletrees that the streets are merely paths in an orchard i have never seen any country where appletrees appeared to thrive so well as in this damp part of south america on the borders of the roads there were many young trees which had evidently planted themselves in chiloe the inhabitants possess a marvellously short method of making an orchard at the lower part of almost every branch small conical brown wrinkled points project these are always ready to change into roots as may sometimes be seen where any mud has been accidentally splashed against the tree a branch as thick as a mans thigh is chosen and is cut off just beneath a group of these points all the smaller branches are lopped off and it is then placed about two feet deep in the ground the operation is performed in the earliest part of the spring during the succeeding summer the stump throws out very long shoots and sometimes even bears fruit i was shown one which had produced as many as twentythree apples but this was thought very unusual the ensuing summer the first year shoots throw out others and by the third season the stump is changed as i have myself seen into a wellwooded tree loaded with an abundance of fruit i understand there is one kind of appletree in england which can be treated in a similar manner but i believe the rapidity of growth and at the same time production of fruit is very inferior to that of the trees in chiloe an old man near valdivia illustrated his motto necessidad es la madre del invencion by giving an account of the several useful things he manufactured from his apples after making cider he extracted from the refuse a white and very finelyflavoured spirit by another process he procured a sweet treacle or as he called it honey he likewise showed us wine derived from the same fruit the children and pigs seemed almost to live during this season of the year in the orchards february thi set out with a guide on a short ride in which however i managed to see singularly little either of the geology of the country or of its inhabitants there is not much cleared land near valdivia after crossing a river at the distance of a few miles we entered the forest and then passed only one miserable hovel before reaching our sleepingplace for the night the short difference in latitude of miles has given another aspect to the forest compared to that of chiloe this is owing to a slightly different proportion in the kinds of trees the evergreens do not appear to be quite so numerous and the forest in consequence is coloured by a brighter and more lively green in the same manner as in chiloe the lower parts are matted together by canes here also another kind of the same family resembling the bamboo of brazil and about twenty feet in height grows in clusters and ornaments the banks of some of the streams in a very pretty manner it is with this plant that the indians make their chuzos or long tapering spears our restinghouse was so dirty that i preferred sleeping outside the first night on these journeys is generally an uncomfortable one because ones body is not accustomed to the tickling and biting of the fleas i am sure in the morning there was not a space on my legs of the size of a shilling which had not its little red mark where the flea had feasted thwe continued to ride through the uncleared forest only occasionally meeting an indian on horseback or a troop of fine mules bringing alerce planks and corn from the southern plains in the afternoon one of the horses knocked up we were then on the brow of a hill which commanded a fine view of the llanos the view of these open plains was very refreshing after being hemmed in and buried amongst a wilderness of trees the uniformity of a forest soon becomes very wearisome this west coast makes me remember with pleasure the free unbounded plains of patagonia yet with the true spirit of contradiction i cannot forget how sublime is the silence of the forest the llanos are the most fertile and thicklypeopled parts of the country as they possess the immense advantage of being nearly free from trees before leaving the forest we crossed some flat little lawns around which single trees encroached in the same manner as in an english park it is curious how frequently a plain seems hostile to the growth of trees humboldt found much difficulty in endeavouring to account for their presence in certain parts of south america and their absence in other parts it appears to me that the level state of the surface very frequently determines this point but the cause of its doing so i do not know in the case of tierra del fuego the deficiency of trees on level ground is probably owing to the accumulation of too much moisture in such situations but to the northward of maldonado in banda oriental where we have a fine undulating country with streams of water which are themselves fringed with woods the circumstance appears to me as i have before stated of very difficult explanation on account of the tired horse i determined to stop close by at the mission of cudico to the friar of which i had a letter of introduction cudico is an intermediate district between the forest and the llanos there are a good many cottages with patches of corn and potatoes nearly all belonging to indians the tribes dependant on valdivia are reducidos y cristianos the indians further northward about arauco and imperial are still very wild and not converted but they all have much intercourse with the spaniards the padre said that the christian indians did not much like coming to mass but that otherwise they show respect for religion the greatest difficulty is in making them observe the ceremonies of marriage the wild indians take as many wives as they can support and a cacique will sometimes have more than ten on entering his house the number may be told by that of the separate fires this plan must be a good one to prevent quarrelling each wife lives a week in turn with the cacique but all are employed in weaving ponchos c for his advantage to be the wife of a cacique is an honour much sought after by the indian women the men of all the tribes wear a coarse woollen poncho but those south of valdivia wear short trousers and those northward a petticoat like the chilipa of the gauchos all have their long hair bound by a scarlet fillet round their heads but otherwise they are uncovered these indians are goodsized men their cheekbones are very prominent and in general appearance they resemble the great american family to which they belong but their physiognomy seemed to me to be slightly different from that of any other tribe which i had before seen their expression is generally grave and even austere and possesses much character this may pass either for honest bluntness or fierce determination the long black hair the grave and muchlined features and the dark complexion called to my mind old portraits of james the first but very likely the resemblance may be imaginary on the road we met with none of that humble politeness so universal in chiloe some gave their mari mari good morning with promptness but the greater number did not seem inclined to offer any salute this independence of manners is probably a consequence of their long wars and the repeated victories which they alone of all the tribes in america have gained over the spaniards i spent the evening very pleasantly talking with the padre he was exceedingly kind and hospitable and coming from santiago had contrived to surround himself with some few comforts being a man of some little education he bitterly complained of the total want of society with no particular zeal for religion no business or pursuit how completely must this mans life be wasted finding nothing which tempted me either to stay or to proceed the next day we set out on our return through the forest we met on the road seven very wild indians amongst them were some caciques who had been receiving a yearly stipend which is paid to some who have long remained faithful they were finelooking men and they rode one after the other with most gloomy faces an old cacique who headed them had been i suppose more excessively drunk than the rest for he seemed both extremely grave and very crabbed shortly before this two indians joined us who were travelling from a distant mission to valdivia concerning some lawsuit one was a goodhumoured old man but from his wrinkled beardless face looked more like an old woman than a man i frequently presented both of them with cigars and though ready to receive them and i dare say grateful they would hardly condescend to thank me a chilotan indian would have taken off his hat and given his dios le page may god repay you the travelling was very tedious both from the badness of the roads and from the number of great fallen trees which it was necessary either to leap over or to avoid by making long circuits we slept on the road and next morning reached valdivia whence i proceeded on board a few days afterwards i crossed the bay with a party of officers and landed near the fort called niebla the buildings were in a most ruinous state and the guncarriages quite rotten mr wickham remarked to the commanding officer that with one discharge they would certainly all fall to pieces the poor man trying to put a good face upon it gravely replied no i am sure sir they would stand two the spaniards must have intended to have made this place impregnable there is now lying in the middle of the courtyard a little mountain of mortar which rivals in hardness the rock on which it is placed it was brought from chile and cost seven thousand dollars the revolution having broken out prevented its being applied to any purpose and now it remains a monument of the fallen greatness of spain i wanted to go to a house about a mile and a half distant but my guide said it was quite impossible to penetrate the wood in a straight line he offered however to lead me by following obscure cattletracks the shortest way the walk nevertheless took no less than three hours this man is employed in hunting strayed cattle yet well as he must know the woods he was not long since lost for two whole days and had nothing to eat these facts convey a good idea of the impracticability of the forests of these countries a question often occurred to mehow long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain this man showed me one which a party of fugitive royalists had cut down fourteen years ago and taking this as a criterion i should think a bole a foot and a half in diameter would in thirty years present a mere ridge of mould february ththe day has been memorable in the annals of valdivia for the most severe earthquake experienced by the oldest inhabitant i happened to be on shore and was lying down in the wood to rest myself it came on suddenly and lasted two minutes but the time appeared much longer the rocking of the ground was most sensible the undulations appeared to my companion and myself to come from due east whilst others thought they proceeded from southwest which shows how difficult it is in all cases to perceive the direction of these vibrations there was no difficulty in standing upright but the motion made me almost giddy it was something like the movement of a vessel in a little cross ripple or still more like that felt by a person skating over thin ice which bends under the weight of his body a bad earthquake at once destroys the oldest associations the world the very emblem of all that is solid has moved beneath our feet like a crust over a fluidone second of time has conveyed to the mind a strange idea of insecurity which hours of reflection would never have created in the forest as a breeze moved the trees i only felt the earth tremble but saw no consequences from it captain fitzroy and the officers were at the town during the shock and there the scene was more awful for although the houses from being built of wood did not fall yet they were so violently shaken that the boards creaked and rattled the people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm i feel little doubt that it is these accompaniments which cause that horror of earthquakes experienced by all those who have thus seen as well as felt their effects within the forest it was a deeply interesting but by no means an aweexciting phenomenon the tides were very curiously affected the great shock took place at the time of low water and an old woman who was on the beach told me that the water flowed very quickly but not in big waves to highwater mark and then as quickly returned to its proper level this was also evident by the line of wet sand this same kind of quick but quiet movement in the tide happened a few years since at chiloe during a slight earthquake and created much causeless alarm in the course of the evening there were other weaker shocks all of which seemed to produce in the harbour the most complicated currents and some of great strength dwe sailed from valdivia and on the th of march entered the harbour of concepcion while the ship was beating up to the anchorage which is distant several miles i was landed on the island of quiriquina the mayordomo of the estate quickly rode down to tell us the terrible news of the great earthquake of the ththat not a house in concepcion or talcuhano the port was standing that seventy villages were destroyed and that a great wave had almost washed away the ruins of talcuhano of this latter fact i soon saw abundant proof the whole coast being strewed over with timber and furniture as if a thousand great ships had been wrecked besides chairs tables bookshelves c in great numbers there were several roofs of cottages which had been drifted in an almost entire state the storehouses at talcuhano had burst open and great bags of cotton yerba and other valuable merchandise were scattered about on the shore during my walk round the island i observed that numerous fragments of rock which from the marine productions adhering to them must recently have been lying in deep water had been cast up high on the beach one of these was a slab six feet by three and about two feet thick the island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of the earthquake as the beach did that of the consequent great wave the ground was fissured in many parts in north and south lines which direction perhaps was caused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of the narrow island some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide many enormous masses had already fallen on the beach and the inhabitants thought that when the rains commenced even much greater slips would happen the effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate which composes the foundation of the island was still more curious the superficial parts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had been blasted by gunpowder this effect which was rendered very evident by the fresh fractures and displaced soil must during earthquakes be confined to near the surface for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock throughout chile this limited action is not improbable as it is certain that the surface of any body when vibrating is in a different condition from the central parts it is perhaps owing to this same reason that earthquakes do not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would at first have been expected i believe this convulsion has been more effectual in lessening the size of the island of quiriquina than the ordinary wear and tear of the weather and the sea during the course of an entire century the next day i landed at talcuhano and afterwards rode to concepcion captain fitzroy has given so detailed and accurate an account of the earthquake that it is almost useless for me to say any thing on the subject but i will extract a few passages from my journal both towns presented the most awful yet interesting spectacle i ever beheld to a person who had formerly known the places it possibly might have been still more impressive for the ruins were so mingled together and the whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place that it was scarcely possible to imagine its former appearance or condition the earthquake commenced at halfpast eleven in the forenoon if it had happened in the middle of the night the greater number of the inhabitants which in this one province amount to many thousands instead of less than a hundred must have perished in concepcion each house or row of houses stood by itself a heap or line of ruins but in talcuhano owing to the great wave little more than one layer of bricks tiles and timber with here and there part of a wall left standing could be distinguished from this circumstance concepcion although not so completely desolated was a more terrible and if i may so call it picturesque sight the first shock was very sudden the invariable practice among the residents in these provinces of running out of doors at the first trembling of the ground alone saved them the mayordomo at quiriquina told me that the first notice he received of the earthquake was finding both the horse he rode and himself rolling together on the ground rising up he was again thrown down he also told me that some cows which were standing on the steep sides of the island were rolled into the sea the great wave however was far more destructive in this respect on one low island near the head of the bay seventy animals were washed off and drowned it is generally thought that this has been the worst earthquake ever recorded in chile but as the very bad ones occur only after long intervals this cannot easily be known nor indeed would a much more severe shock have made any great difference for the ruin is now complete after viewing concepcion i cannot understand how the greater number of inhabitants escaped unhurt the houses in many parts fell outwards thus forming in the middle of the streets little hillocks of brickwork and rubbish mr rous the english consul told us that he was at breakfast when the first movement warned him to run out he had scarcely reached the middle of the courtyard when one side of his house came thundering down he retained presence of mind to remember that if he once got on the top of that part which had already fallen he should be safe not being able from the motion of the ground to stand he crawled up on his hands and knees and no sooner had he ascended this little eminence than the other side of the house fell in the great beams sweeping close in front of his head with his eyes blinded and his mouth choked with the cloud of dust which darkened the sky at last he gained the street as shock succeeded shock at the interval of a few minutes no one dared approach the shattered ruins and no one knew whether his dearest friends and relations might not be perishing from the want of help the thatched roofs fell over the fires and flames burst forth in all parts hundreds knew themselves to be ruined and few had the means of providing food for the day can a more miserable and fearful scene be imagined earthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any country if for instance beneath england the now inert subterranean forces should exert those powers which most assuredly in former geological ages they have exerted how completely would the entire condition of the country be changed what would become of the lofty houses thicklypacked cities great manufacturies the beautiful public and private edifices if the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great earthquake in the dead of the night how terrific would be the carnage england would at once be bankrupt all papers records and accounts would from that moment be lost government being unable to collect the taxes and failing to maintain its authority the hand of violence and rapine would go uncontrolled in every large town famine would be proclaimed pestilence and death following in its train captain fitzroy has given an account of the great wave which travelling from seaward burst over talcuhano in the middle of the bay it was seen as one unbroken swell of the water but on each side meeting with resistance it curled over and tore up cottages and trees as it swept onwards with overwhelming force at the head of the bay it is easy to imagine the fearful line of white breakers which three times rushed over and almost obliterated the ruins of the former town pools of salt water yet remained in the streets and children making boats with old tables and chairs appeared as happy as their parents were miserable it was however exceedingly interesting to observe how active and cheerful all appeared after their heavy misfortune it was remarked with much truth that from the destruction being universal no one individual was humbled more than another or could suspect his friends of coldness and this latter effect is perhaps the most grievous one of the loss of wealth mr rous and a large party whom he kindly took under his protection lived for the first week in a garden beneath some appletrees at first they were as merry as if it had been a picnic but soon afterwards heavy rain caused much discomfort for they were absolutely without shelter in captain fitzroys paper it is said that two explosions one like a column of smoke and another like the blowing of a great whale were seen in the bay of concepcion the water also appeared every where to be boiling and it became black and exhaled a most disagreeable sulphureous smell i am informed by mr alison that during the earthquake of these lastmentioned circumstances occurred in the bay of valparaiso the two great explosions in the first case must no doubt be connected with deepseated changes but the bubbling water its black colour and fetid smell the usual concomitants of a severe earthquake may i think be attributed to the disturbance of mud containing organic matter in decay in the bay of callao during a calm day i noticed that as the ship dragged her cable over the bottom its course was marked by a line of bubbles the lower orders in talcuhano thought that the earthquake was caused by some old indian women who two years ago having been offended stopped the volcano of antuco this silly belief is curious because it shows that experience has taught them to observe the constant relation between the suppressed activity of volcanoes and the trembling of the ground it was necessary to apply the witchcraft to the point where their knowledge stopped and this was the closing of the volcanic vent this saying is the more odd in this particular instance because the result of captain fitzroys investigation was to discountenance the belief that antuco whatever might have been the case with the volcanoes further northward was any way affected the town of concepcion was built in the usual spanish fashion with all the streets running at right angles to each other one set ranged sw by w and ne by e and the other nw by n and se by s the walls in the former direction certainly stood better than those in the other captain fitzroy has likewise remarked that the greater number of the masses of brickwork were thrown down towards the ne both these circumstances perfectly agree with the general idea of the undulation having come from the sw in which quarter subterranean noises were also sometimes heard it is evident on this supposition that the nw and s e walls being nearly coincident with the line of undulation or with the crests of the successive waves would be much more likely to fall than those which had their extremities presented towards the point whence the vibration proceeded for in the first case the whole wall would be thrown at the same moment out of its perpendicular this may be illustrated by placing books edgewise on a carpet and then after the manner suggested by michell imitating the undulations of an earthquake it will be found that they fall with more or less readiness according to their direction the fissures in the ground though not uniform generally had a se and nw direction and therefore they corresponded to the lines of principal flexure bearing in mind all these circumstances which so clearly point to the sw as the chief focus of disturbance it is a very interesting fact that the island of s maria situated in that quarter was during the general uplifting of the land to which i shall presently refer raised to nearly three times the altitude of any other part of the coast the different resistance offered by the walls according to their direction was well exemplified in the case of the cathedral the side which fronted the ne presented a grand pile of ruins in the midst of which doorcases and masses of timber stood up as if floating in a stream some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great dimensions and they had been rolled to a distance on the level plaza like fragments of rock round the base of some high mountain the side walls though exceedingly fractured yet remained standing but the vast buttresses at right angles to them and therefore parallel to the walls that fell were in many cases cut clean off as if by a chisel and hurled to the ground some square ornaments on the coping of these same walls were moved by the earthquake into a diagonal position the buttresses of the church of la merced at valparaiso and some heavy pieces of furniture in the rooms were similarly affected by the shock of mr lyell has also given a drawing of an obelisk in calabria of which the separate stones were partially turned round in these instances the displacement at first appears to be owing to a vorticose movement beneath each point thus affected but such can hardly be the case may it not be caused by a tendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular position with respect to the lines of vibration in a manner somewhat similar to pins on a sheet of paper or on a board when it is shaken generally speaking arched doorways or windows stood much better than any other kind of building nevertheless a poor lame old man who had been in the habit during trifling shocks of crawling to a certain doorway was this time crushed to pieces i have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance of concepcion for i feel it is quite impossible to convey the mingled feelings with which one beholds such a spectacle several of the officers visited it before me but their strongest language failed to communicate a just idea of the desolation it is a bitter and humiliating thing to see works which have cost men so much time and labour overthrown in one minute yet compassion for the inhabitants is almost instantly forgotten from the interest excited in finding that state of things produced in a moment of time which one is accustomed to attribute to a succession of ages in my opinion we have scarcely beheld since leaving england any other sight so deeply interesting in almost every severe earthquake which has been described the neighbouring waters of the sea are said to have been greatly agitated the disturbance seems generally as in the case of concepcion to have been of two kinds first at the instant of the shock the water swells high up on the beach with a gentle motion and then as quietly retreats secondly some little time afterwards the whole body of the sea retires from the coast and then returns in great waves of overwhelming force the first and less regular movement seems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake differently affecting a fluid and a solid so that their respective levels are slightly deranged but the second case is a far more important phenomenon and at first appears of less easy explanation in reading accounts of earthquakes and especially of those on the west coast of america as collated from various authors by sir w parish it is certain that the first great movement of the waters has been that of retiring several hypotheses have been invented to explain this fact some have supposed it owing to a vertical oscillation in the land the water retaining its level but this can hardly happen even on a moderately shoal coast for the water near the land must partake of the motion of the bottom moreover as mr lyell has urged a change of level in the land will not account for movements in the sea of a similar nature affecting islands distant from the line of uplifted coast this occurred at madeira during the famous lisbon earthquake juan fernandez also offers a parallel instance for the sea was disturbed there much in the same manner as on the coast of chile the whole phenomenon it appears to me is due to a common undulation in the water proceeding from a line or point of disturbance some little way distant if the waves sent off from the paddles of a steamvessel be watched breaking on the sloping shore of a still river the water will be seen first to retire two or three feet and then to return in little breakers precisely analogous to those consequent on an earthquake from the oblique direction in which the waves are sent off from the paddles the vessel has proceeded a long way ahead before the undulation reaches the shore and hence it is at once manifest that this movement bears no relation to the actual displacement of the fluid from the bulk of the vessel indeed it seems a general circumstance that in all cases where the equilibrium of an undulation is thus destroyed the water is drawn from the resisting surface to form the advancing breaker considering then a wave produced by an earthquake as an ordinary undulation proceeding from some point or line in the offing we can see the cause first of its occurrence some time after the shock secondly of its affecting the shores of the mainland and of outlying islets in a uniform mannernamely the water retiring first and then returning in a mountainous breaker and lastly of its size being modified as appears to be the case by the form of the neighbouring coast for instance talcuhano and callao are situated at the head of great shoaling bays and they have always suffered from this phenomenon whereas the town of valparaiso which is seated close on the border of a profound ocean though shaken by the severest earthquakes has never been overwhelmed by one of these terrific deluges on this view we have only to imagine in the case of concepcion a point of disturbance in the bottom of the sea in a southwest direction whence the wave was seen to travel and where the land was elevated to a greater height than any other partand the whole phenomenon will be explained it is probable that near every coast the chief line of disturbance would be situated at that distance in the offing where the fluid which was most agitated from overlying the shallow bottom near the land joined on to that part which covered the depths but slightly moved of the ocean in all distant parts of the coast the small oscillations of the sea both at the moment of the great shock and during the lesser following ones would be confounded with the undulation propagated from the focus of disturbance and hence the series of movements would be undistinguishable the most remarkable effect or perhaps speaking more correctly cause of this earthquake was the permanent elevation of the land captain fitzroy having twice visited the island of santa maria for the purpose of examining every circumstance with extreme accuracy has brought a mass of evidence in proof of such elevation far more conclusive than that on which geologists on most other occasions place implicit faith the phenomenon possesses an uncommon degree of interest from this particular part of the coast of chile having previously been the theatre of several earthquakes of the worst class it is almost certain from the altered soundings together with the circumstance of the bottom of the bay near penco consisting of hard stone that there has been an uplifting to the amount of four fathoms since the famous convulsion of with this additional instance fresh before us we may assume as probable according to the principles laid down by mr lyell other small successive elevations and may fearlessly maintain that the problem of the raised shells recorded by ulloa is explained some of the consequences which may be deduced from the phenomena connected with this earthquake are most important in a geological point of view but in the present work i cannot do more than simply allude to the results although it is known that earthquakes have been felt over enormous spaces and strange subterranean noises likewise heard over nearly equal areas yet few cases are on record of volcanoes very far distant from each other bursting out at the same moment of time in this instance however at the same hour when the whole country around concepcion was permanently elevated a train of volcanoes situated in the andes in front of chiloe instantaneously spouted out a dark column of smoke and during the subsequent year continued in uncommon activity it is moreover a very interesting circumstance that in the immediate neighbourhood these eruptions entirely relieved the trembling ground although at a little distance and in sight of the volcanoes the island of chiloe was strongly affected to the northward a volcano burst out at the bottom of the sea adjoining the island of juan fernandez and several of the great chimneys in the cordillera of central chile commenced a fresh period of activity we thus see a permanent elevation of the land renewed activity through habitual vents and a submarine outburst forming parts of one great phenomenon the extent of country throughout which the subterranean forces were thus unequivocally displayed measures by geographical miles from several considerations which i have not space here to enter on and especially from the number of intermediate points whence liquefied matter was ejected we can scarcely avoid the conclusion however fearful it may be that a vast lake of melted matter of an area nearly doubling in extent that of the black sea is spread out beneath a mere crust of solid land the elevation of the land to the amount of some feet during these earthquakes appears to be a paroxysmal movement in a series of lesser and even insensible steps by which the whole west coast of south america has been raised above the level of the sea in the same manner the most violent explosion from any volcano is merely one in a series of lesser eruptions and we have seen that both these phonomena which are in so many ways related are parts of one common action only modified by local circumstances with respect to the cause of the paroxysmal convulsion in particular portions of the great area which is simultaneously affected it can be shown to be extremely probable that it is owing to the giving way of the superincumbent strata and this giving way probably is a consequence of the tension from the general elevation and their interjection by fluid rockone step in the formation of a mountain chain on this view we are led to conclude that the unstratified mass forming the axis of any mountain has been pumped in when in a fluid state by as many separate strokes as there were earthquakes for instance in the case of concepcion during the few months subsequent to the great shock upwards of three hundred tremours of the ground were felt each of which indicated a fresh fracture and injection of the fluid stone it is a case precisely analogous to what happens in all bad eruptions which are invariably followed by a succession of smaller ones the difference is that in the volcano the lava is ejected while in the formation of a mountain chain it is injected this view of the extremely gradual elevation of a line of mountains will alone explain the difficulty which as far as i am aware has never been attempted to be solved of the axis consisting of rock which has become solid under the pressure of the superincumbent strata while yet these same strata in their present inclined and vertical positions cannot possibly cover more than a small portion of that axis chapter xvii valparaiso passage of andes by portillo pass sagacity of mules mountain torrents mines how discovered marine

river cumbre valparaiso passage of cordillera march th we staid only three days at concepcion and then sailed for valparaiso the wind being northerly we only reached the mouth of the harbour of concepcion before it was dark being very near the land and a fog coming on the anchor was dropped presently a large american whaler appeared close alongside of us and we heard the yankee swearing at his men to make them keep quiet whilst he listened where the breakers were captain fitzroy hailed him in a loud clear voice to anchor where he then was the poor man must have thought the voice came from the shore such a babel of cries issued at once from the ship every one hallooing out let go the anchor veer cable shorten sail it was the most laughable thing i ever heard if the ships crew had been all captains and no men there could not have been a greater uproar of orders we afterwards found that the mate stuttered i suppose all hands were assisting him in giving his orders on the th we anchored at valparaiso and two days afterwards i set out on an excursion to cross the cordillera i proceeded to santiago where mr caldcleugh most kindly assisted me in every possible way in making the little preparations which were necessary in this immediate part of chile there are two passes across the andes to mendoza and the plains on the opposite side the one most commonly used namely that of aconcagua or uspallata is situated some way to the northward of the capital the other called the portillo is to the southward and less distant the latter is however rather more lofty and from the double chain more dangerous during a snowstorm for these reasons it is but little used especially late in the season march thwe set out for the portillo pass leaving santiago we crossed the wide burntup plain on which that city stands and in the afternoon arrived at the maypo one of the principal rivers in chile the valley at the point where it enters the first cordillera is bounded on each side by lofty barren mountains and although not broad it is very fertile numerous cottages were surrounded by vines and by orchards of apple nectarine and peach trees the boughs of the latter breaking with the weight of the beautiful ripe fruit in the evening we passed the customhouse where our luggage was examined the frontier of chile is better guarded by the cordillera than by the waters of the sea there are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges and except by these the mountains are far too steep and lofty for any beast of burden to pass over them the customhouse officers were very civil which was perhaps partly owing to the passport which the president of the republic had given me but i must also express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost every chileno in this instance the contrast with the same class of men in most other countries was strongly marked i may mention an anecdote with which i was much pleased at the time we met near mendoza a little and very fat negress riding astride on a mule she had a goître so enormous that it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment but my two companions almost instantly by way of apology made the common salute of the country by taking off their hats where would one of the lower classes in europe have shown such feeling politeness to a poor and miserable object of a degraded race at night we slept at a cottage our manner of travelling was delightfully independent in the inhabited parts we bought a little firewood hired pasture for the animals and bivouacked in the corner of the same field with them carrying an iron pot we cooked and ate our supper under the cloudless sky and knew no trouble my companions were mariano gonzales who had formerly accompanied me and an arriero with his ten mules and a madrina the madrina or godmother is a most important personage she is an old steady mare with a little bell round her neck and wheresoever she goes the mules like good children follow her if several large troops are turned into one field to graze in the morning the muleteer has only to lead the madrinas a little apart and tinkle their bells and although there may be two or three hundred mules together each immediately knows its own bell and separates itself from the rest the affection of these animals for their madrinas saves infinite trouble it is nearly impossible to lose an old mule for if detained for several hours by force she will by the power of smell like a dog track out her companions or rather the madrina for according to the muleteer she is the chief object of affection the feeling however is not of an individual nature for i believe i am right in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as madrina in a troop each animal carries on a level road a cargo weighing pounds more than twentynine stone but in a mountainous country a hundred pounds less yet with what delicate slim limbs without any proportional bulk of muscle these animals support so great a burden the mule always appears to me a most surprising animal that a hybrid should possess more reason memory obstinacy social affection and powers of muscular endurance than either of its parents seems to indicate that art has here outmastered nature of our ten animals six were intended for riding and four for carrying cargoes each taking turn about we carried a good deal of food in case we should be snowed up as the season was rather late for passing the portillo march thwe rode during this day to the last and therefore most elevated house in the valley the number of inhabitants became scanty but wherever water could be brought on the land it was very fertile all the valleys in the cordillera agree in the same kind of structure an irregularlystratified mass of wellrounded shingle together with a little mud and sand fills up the bottom to the depth of some hundred feet this deposit follows the course of the valley sloping upwards with a most gradual and gentle inclination the rivers have removed a large part in the centre thus leaving a terrace of equal height but varying width on each side this narrow space between the cliffs bordering the bed of the river and the foot of the mountains is the only part fit for cultivation and on it likewise the road is carried the rivers such as the maypo which flow in these valleys should rather be called mountain torrents their inclination is very great and their water the colour of mud the roar which the maypo made as it rushed over the great rounded fragments was like that of the sea amidst the din of rushing waters the noise from the stones as they rattled one over another was most distinctly audible even at a distance this rattling noise night and day may be heard along the whole course of the torrent the sound spoke eloquently to the geologist the thousands and thousands of stones which striking against each other make the one dull uniform sound are all hurrying in one direction it is like thinking of time where the minute that now glides past is irrecoverable so is it with these stones the ocean is their eternity and each note of that wild music tells of one other step towards their destiny it is not possible for the mind to comprehend except by a slow process any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often that the multiplier itself ceases to convey any more definite idea than the savage receives when he points to the hairs of his head as often as i have seen beds of mud sand and shingle accumulated to the thickness of many thousand feet i have felt inclined to exclaim that causes such as the present rivers and the present beaches could never have ground down such masses but on the other hand when listening to the rattling noise of these torrents and calling to mind that whole races of animals have passed away from the surface of the globe during the period throughout which night and day these stones have gone rattling onwards in their course i have thought to myself can any mountains any continent withstand such waste in this part of the valley the mountains on each side are from about three to six or eight thousand feet high their outline is rounded but with steep and bare flanks the general colour of the rock is a dullish purple and the stratification very distinct if the scenery is not beautiful it is remarkable and grand we met during the day several herds of cattle which men were driving down from the higher valleys in the cordillera this sign of the approaching winter hurried our steps more than was convenient for geological purposes the house where we slept was situated at the foot of a mountain on the summit of which are the mines of s pedro de nolasko sir f head wonders how mines have been discovered in situations so extraordinary as the bleak summit of the mountain of s pedro de nolasko in the first place metallic veins in this country are generally harder than the surrounding strata hence during the gradual degradation of the hills they project above the surface of the ground secondly almost every labourer especially in the northern parts of chile understands something about the appearance of ores in the great mining provinces of coquimbo and copiapó firewood is very scarce and men are employed in searching for it over every hill and dale and by this means nearly all the richest mines have there been discovered chanuncillo from which silver to the value of many hundred thousand pounds has been raised in the course of a few years was thus discovered a man having thrown a stone at his loaded donkey afterwards thought that it was very heavy and picking it up again he found it was full of pure silver the vein occurred at no great distance standing up like a wedge of silver the miners also on sundays taking a crowbar with them often set out on such discoveries in the south part of chile the men who drive cattle into the cordillera and who frequent every ravine where there is a little pasture are the usual agents march thas we ascended the valley the vegetation with the exception of a few pretty alpine flowers became exceedingly scanty and of birds animals or insects scarcely one could be seen the lofty mountains their summits marked with a few patches of snow stood well separated from each other the valleys being filled up with an immense thickness of stratified alluvium
