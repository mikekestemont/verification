and granular oxide of iron near the baths of cauquenes between two short parallel lines of elevation where they are intersected by the valley there is a small though distinct volcanic district the rock is a dark grey andesitic trachyte which fuses into a greenishgrey bead and is formed of long crystals of fractured glassy albite judging from one measurement mingled with wellformed crystals often twin of augite the whole mass is vesicular but the surface is darker coloured and much more vesicular than any other part this trachyte forms a cliffbounded horizontal narrow strip on the steep southern side of the valley at the height of or feet above the riverbed judging from an apparently corresponding line of cliff on the northern side the valley must once have been filled up to this height by a field of lava on the summit of a lofty mountain some leagues higher up this same valley of the cachapual i found columnar pitchstone porphyritic with feldspar i do not suppose this rock to be of volcanic origin and only mention it here from its being intersected by masses and dikes of a vesicular rock approaching in character to trachyte in no other part of chile did i observe vesicular or amygdaloidal dikes though these are so common in ordinary volcanic districts passage of the andes by the portillo or peuquenes pass although i crossed the cordillera only once by this pass and only once by that of the cumbre or uspallata presently to be described riding slowly and halting occasionally to ascend the mountains there are many circumstances favourable to obtaining a more faithful sketch of their structure than would at first be thought possible from so short an examination the mountains are steep and absolutely bare of vegetation the atmosphere is resplendently clear the stratification distinct and the rocks brightly and variously coloured some of the natural sections might be truly compared for distinctness to those coloured ones in geological works considering how little is known of the structure of this gigantic range to which i particularly attended most travellers having collected only specimens of the rocks i think my sketchsections though necessarily imperfect possess some interest the section given in plate i fig which i will now describe in detail is on a horizontal scale of a third of an inch to a nautical mile and on a vertical scale of one inch to a mile or feet the width of the range excluding a few outlying hillocks from the plain on which st jago the capital of chile stands to the pampas is sixty miles as far as i can judge from the maps which differ from each other and are all exceedingly imperfect the st jago plain at the mouth of the maypu i estimate from adjoining known points at feet and the pampas at feet both above the level of the sea the height of the peuquenes line according to dr gillies is feet and that of the portillo line both in the gaps where the road crosses them is feet the lowest part of the intermediate valley of tenuyan is feetall above the level of the sea the cordillera here and indeed i believe throughout chile consist of several parallel anticlinal and uniclinal mountainlines ranging north or north with a little westing and south some exterior and much lower ridges often vary considerably from this course projecting like oblique spurs from the main ranges in the district towards the pacific the mountains as before remarked extend in various directions even east and west in the main exterior lines the strata as also before remarked are seldom inclined at a high angle but in the central lofty ridges they are almost always highly inclined broken by many great faults and often vertical as far as i could judge few of the ranges are of great length and in the central parts of the cordillera i was frequently able to follow with my eye a ridge gradually becoming higher and higher as the stratification increased in inclination from one end where its height was trifling and its strata gently inclined to the other end where vertical strata formed snowclad pinnacles even outside the main cordillera near the baths of cauquenes i observed one such case where a north and south ridge had its strata in the valley inclined at and less than a mile south of it at another parallel and similarly inclined ridge rose at the distance of about five miles into a lofty mountain with absolutely vertical strata within the cordillera the height of the ridges and the inclination of the strata often became doubled and trebled in much shorter distances than five miles this peculiar form of upheaval probably indicates that the stratified crust was thin and hence yielded to the underlying intrusive masses unequally at certain points on the lines of fissure the valleys by which the cordillera are drained follow the anticlinal or rarely synclinal troughs which deviate most from the usual north and south course or still more commonly those lines of faults or of unequal curvature that is lines with the strata on both hands dipping in the same direction but at a somewhat different angle which deviate most from a northerly course occasionally the torrents run for some distance in the north and south valleys and then recover their eastern or western course by bursting through the ranges at those points where the strata have been least inclined and the height consequently is less hence the valleys along which the roads run are generally zigzag and in drawing an east and west section it is necessary to contract greatly that which is actually seen on the road commencing at the western end of the coloured section plate i where the r maypu debouches on the plain of st jago we immediately enter on the porphyritic conglomerate formation and in the midst of it find some hummocks a of granite and syenite which probably for i neglected to collect specimens belong to the andesitic class these are succeeded by some rugged hills b of darkgreen crystalline feldspathic and in some parts slaty rocks which i believe belong to the altered clayslate formation from this point great mountains of purplish and greenish generally thinly stratified highly porphyritic conglomerates including many strata of amygdaloidal and greenstone porphyries extend up the valley to the junction of the rivers yeso and volcan as the valley here runs in a very southerly course the width of the porphyritic conglomerate formation is quite conjectural and from the same cause i was unable to make out much about the stratification in most of the exterior mountains the dip was gentle and directed inwards and at only one spot i observed an inclination as high as near the junction of the r colorado with the main stream there is a hill of whitish brecciated partially decomposed feldspathic porphyry having a volcanic aspect but not being really of that nature at tolla however in this valley dr meyen met with a hill of pumice containing mica at the junction of the yeso and volcan d there is an extensive mass in white conical hillocks of andesite containing some mica and passing either into andesitic granite or into a spotted semigranular mixture of albitic feldspar and hornblende in the midst of this formation dr meyen found true trachyte the andesite is covered by strata of darkcoloured crystalline obscurely porphyritic rocks and above them by the ordinary porphyritic conglomeratesthe strata all dipping away at a small angle from the underlying mass the surrounding lofty mountains appear to be entirely composed of the porphyritic conglomerate and i estimated its thickness here at between and feet beyond the junction of the yeso and volcan the porphyritic strata appear to dip towards the hillocks of andesite at an angle of but at some distant points on the same ridge they are bent up and vertical following the valley of the yeso trending ne and therefore still unfavourable for our transverse section the same porphyritic conglomerate formation is prolonged to near the cuestadel indio situated at the western end of the basin like a drained lake of yeso some way before arriving at this point distant lofty pinnacles capped by coloured strata belonging to the great gypseous formation could first be seen from the summit of the cuesta looking southward there is a magnificent sectional view of a mountainmass at least feet in thickness e of fine andesitic granite containing much black mica a little chlorite and quartz which sends great white dikes far into the superincumbent darkcoloured porphyritic conglomerates at the line of junction the two formations are wonderfully interlaced together in the lower part of the porphyritic conglomerate the stratification has been quite obliterated whilst in the upper part it is very distinct the beds composing the crests of the surrounding mountains being inclined at angles of between and and some being even vertical on the northern side of the valley there is a great corresponding mass of andesitic granite which is encased by porphyritic conglomerate dipping both on the western and eastern sides at about to west but on the eastern side with the tips of the strata bent in such a manner as to render it probable that the whole mass had been on that side thrown over and inverted in the valleybasin of the yeso which i estimated at feet above the level of the sea we first reach at f the gypseous formation its thickness is very great it consists in most parts of snowwhite hard compact gypsum which breaks with a saccharine fracture having translucent edges under the blowpipe gives out much vapour it frequently includes nests and exceedingly thin layers of crystallised blackish carbonate of lime large irregularly shaped concretions externally still exhibiting lines of aqueous deposition of blackishgray but sometimes white coarsely and brilliantly crystallised hard anhydrite abound within the common gypsum hillocks formed of the hardest and purest varieties of the white gypsum stand up above the surrounding parts and have their surfaces cracked and marked just like newly baked bread there is much pale brown soft argillaceous gypsum and there were some intercalated green beds which i had not time to reach i saw only one fragment of selenite or transparent gypsum and that perhaps may have come from some subsequently formed vein from the mineralogical characters here given it is probable that these gypseous beds have undergone some metamorphic action the strata are much hidden by detritus but they appeared in most parts to be highly inclined and in an adjoining lofty pinnacle they could be distinctly seen bending up and becoming vertical conformably with the underlying porphyritic conglomerate in very many parts of the great mountainface f composed of thin gypseous beds there were innumerable masses irregularly shaped and not like dikes yet with welldefined edges of an imperfectly granular pale greenish or yellowishwhite rock essentially composed of feldspar with a little chlorite or hornblende epidote ironpyrites and ferruginous powder i believe that these curious trappean masses have been injected from the not far distant mountainmass e of andesite whilst still fluid and that owing to the softness of the gypseous strata they have not acquired the ordinary forms of dikes subsequently to the injection of these feldspathic rocks a great dislocation has taken place and the much shattered gypseous strata here overlie a hillock g composed of vertical strata of impure limestone and of black highly calcareous shale including threads of gypsum these rocks as we shall presently see belong to the upper parts of the gypseous series and hence must here have been thrown down by a vast fault proceeding up the valleybasin of the yeso and taking our section sometimes on one hand and sometimes on the other we come to a great hill of stratified porphyritic conglomerate h dipping at to the west and a few hundred yards farther on we have a bed between or feet thick of gypsum i dipping eastward at a very high angle here then we have a fault and anticlinal axis on the opposite side of the valley a vertical mass of red conglomerate conformably underlying the gypsum appears gradually to lose its stratification and passes into a mountain of porphyry the gypsum i is covered by a bed k at least feet in thickness of a purplishred compact heavy finegrained sandstone or mudstone which fuses easily into a white enamel and is seen under a lens to contain triturated crystals this is succeeded by a bed l feet thick i believe i understate the thickness of gypsum exactly like the beds before described and this again is capped by another great bed m of purplishred sandstone all these strata dip eastward but the inclination becomes less and less as we leave the first and almost vertical bed i of gypsum leaving the basinplain of yeso the road rapidly ascends passing by mountains composed of the gypseous and associated beds with their stratification greatly disturbed and therefore not easily intelligible hence this part of the section has been left uncoloured shortly before reaching the great peuquenes ridge the lowest stratum visible n is a red sandstone or mudstone capped by a vast thickness of black compact calcareous shaly rock o which has been thrown into four lofty though small ridges looking northward the strata in these ridges are seen gradually to rise in inclination becoming in some distant pinnacles absolutely vertical the ridge of peuquenes which divides the waters flowing into the pacific and atlantic oceans extends in a nearly nnw and sse line its strata dip eastward at an angle of between and but in the higher peaks bending up and becoming almost vertical where the road crosses this range the height is feet above the sealevel and i estimated the neighbouring pinnacles at from to feet the lowest stratum visible in this ridge is a red stratified sandstone p on it are superimposed two great masses q and s of black hard compact even having a conchoidal fracture calcareous more or less laminated shale passing into limestone this rock contains organic remains presently to be enumerated the compacter varieties fuse easily in a white glass and this i may add is a very general character with all the sedimentary beds in the cordillera although this rock when broken is generally quite black it everywhere weathers into an ashgray tint between these two great masses q and s a bed r of gypsum is interposed about feet in thickness and having the same characters as heretofore described i estimated the total thickness of these three beds q r s at nearly feet and to this must be added as will be immediately seen a great overlying mass of red sandstone in descending the eastern slope of this great central range the strata which in the upper part dip eastward at about an angle of become more and more curved till they are nearly vertical and a little farther onwards there is seen on the farther side of a ravine a thick mass of strata of bright red sandstone t with their upper extremities slightly curved showing that they were once conformably prolonged over the beds s on the southern and opposite side of the road this red sandstone and the underlying black shaly rocks stand vertical and in actual juxtaposition continuing to descend we come to a synclinal valley filled with rubbish beyond which we have the red sandstone t corresponding with t and now dipping as is seen both north and south of the road at to the west and under it the beds s r q and i believe p in corresponding order and of similar composition with those on the western flank of the peuquenes range but dipping westward close to the synclinal valley the dip of these strata is but at the eastern or farther end of the series it increases to here the great gypseous formation abruptly terminates and is succeeded eastward by a pile of more modern strata considering how violently these central ranges have been dislocated and how very numerous dikes are in the exterior and lower parts of the cordillera it is remarkable that i did not here notice a single dike the prevailing rock in this neighbourhood is the black calcareous compact shale whilst in the valleybasin of the yeso the purplish red sandstone or mudstone predominatesboth being associated with gypseous strata of exactly the same nature it would be very difficult to ascertain the relative superposition of these several masses for we shall afterwards see in the cumbre pass that the gypseous and intercalated beds are lensshaped and that they thin out even where very thick and disappear in short horizontal distances it is quite possible that the black shales and red sandstones may be contemporaneous but it is more probable that the former compose the uppermost parts of the series the fossils above alluded to in the black calcareous shales are few in number and are in an imperfect condition some of the fragments of ammonites were as thick as a mans arm the gryphæa is much the most abundant shell these fossils m dorbigny considers as belonging to the neocomian stage of the cretaceous system dr meyen who ascended the valley of the rio volcan a branch of the yeso found a nearly similar but apparently more calcareous formation with much gypsum and no doubt the equivalent of that here described the beds were vertical and were prolonged up to the limits of perpetual snow at the height of feet above the sea they abounded with fossils consisting according to von buch von buch concludes that this formation is intermediate between the limestone of the jura and the chalk and that it is analogous with the uppermost jurassic beds forming the plains of switzerland hence m dorbigny and von buch under different terms compare these fossils to those from the same late stage in the secondary formations of europe some of the fossils which i collected were found a good way down the western slope of the main ridge and hence must originally have been covered up by a great thickness of the black shaly rock independently of the now denuded thick overlying masses of red sandstone i neglected at the time to estimate how many hundred or rather thousand feet thick the superincumbent strata must have been and i will not now attempt to do so this however would have been a highly interesting point as indicative of a great amount of subsidence of which we shall hereafter find in other parts of the cordillera analogous evidence during this same period the altitude of the peuquenes range considering its not great antiquity is very remarkable many of the fossils were embedded at the height of feet and the same beds are prolonged up to at least from to above the level of the sea the portillo or eastern chainthe valley of tenuyan separating the peuquenes and portillo lines is as estimated by dr gillies and myself about twenty miles in width the lowest part where the road crosses the river being feet above the sealevel the pass on the portillo line is feet high feet higher than that on the peuquenes and the neighbouring pinnacles must i conceive rise to nearly feet above the sea the river draining the intermediate valley of tenuyan passes through the portillo line to return to our sectionshortly after leaving the lower beds p of the gypseous formation we come to grand masses of a coarse red conglomerate v totally unlike any strata hitherto seen in the cordillera this conglomerate is distinctly stratified some of the beds being well defined by the greater size of the pebbles the cement is calcareous and sometimes crystalline though the mass shows no signs of having been metamorphosed the included pebbles are either perfectly or only partially rounded they consist of purplish sandstones of various porphyries of brownish limestone of black calcareous compact shale precisely like that in situ in the peuquenes range and containing some of the same fossil shells also very many pebbles of quartz some of micaceous schist and numerous broken rounded crystals of a reddish orthitic or potash feldspar as determined by professor miller and these from their size must have been derived from a coarsegrained rock probably granite from this feldspar being orthitic and even from its external appearance i venture positively to affirm that it has not been derived from the rocks of the western ranges but on the other hand it may well have come together with the quartz and metamorphic schists from the eastern or portillo line for this line mainly consists of coarse orthitic granite the pebbles of the fossiliferous slate and of the purple sandstone certainly have been derived from the peuquenes or western ranges the road crosses the valley of tenuyan in a nearly east and west line and for several miles we have on both hands the conglomerate everywhere dipping west and forming separate great mountains the strata where first met with after leaving the gypseous formation areinclined westward at an angle of only which farther on increases to about the gypseous strata as we have seen are also inclined westward hence when looking from the eastern side of the valley towards the peuquenes range a most deceptive appearance is presented as if the newer beds of conglomerate dipped directly under the much older beds of the gypseous formation in the middle of the valley a bold mountain of unstratified lilaccoloured porphyry with crystals of hornblende projects and farther on a little south of the road there is another mountain with its strata inclined at a small angle eastwards which in its general aspect and colour resembles the porphyritic conglomerate formation so rare on this side of the peuquenes line and so grandly developed throughout the western ranges the conglomerate is of great thickness i do not suppose that the strata forming the separate mountainmasses v v v have ever been prolonged over each other but that one mass has been broken up by several distinct parallel uniclinal lines of elevation judging therefore of the thickness of the conglomerate as seen in the separate mountainmasses i estimated it at least from to feet the lower beds rest conformably on some singularly coloured soft strata w which i could not reach to examine and these again rest conformably on a thick mass of micaceous thinly laminated siliceous sandstone x associated with a little black clayslate these lower beds are traversed by several dikes of decomposing porphyry the laminated sandstone is directly superimposed on the vast masses of granite y y which mainly compose the portillo range the line of junction between this latter rock which is of a bright red colour and the whitish sandstone was beautifully distinct the sandstone being penetrated by numerous great tortuous dikes branching from the granite and having been converted into a granular quartz rock singularly like that of the falkland islands containing specks of an ochery powder and black crystalline atoms apparently of imperfect mica the quartzose strata in one spot were folded into a regular dome the granite which composes the magnificent bare pinnacles and the steep western flank of the portillo chain is of a brickred colour coarsely crystallized and composed of orthitic or potash feldspar quartz and imperfect mica in small quantity sometimes passing into chlorite these minerals occasionally assume a laminar or foliated arrangement the fact of the feldspar being orthitic in this range is very remarkable considering how rare or rather as i believe entirely absent this mineral is throughout the western ranges in which sodafeldspar or at least a variety cleaving like albite is so extremely abundant in one spot on the western flank and on the eastern flank near los manantiales and near the crest i noticed some great masses of a whitish granite parts of it finegrained and parts containing large crystals of feldspar i neglected to collect specimens so i do not know whether this feldspar is also orthitic though i am inclined to think so from its general appearance i saw also some syenite and one mass which resembled andesite but of which i likewise neglected to collect specimens from the manner in which the whitish granites formed separate mountainmasses in the midst of the brickred variety and from one such mass near the crest being traversed by numerous veins of fleshcoloured and greenish eurite into which i occasionally observed the brickred granite insensibly passing i conclude that the white granites probably belong to an older formation almost overwhelmed andpenetrated by the red granite on the crest i saw also at a short distance some coloured stratified beds apparently like those w at the western base but was prevented examining them by a snowstorm mr caldcleugh however collected here specimens of ribboned jasper magnesian limestone and other minerals a little way down the eastern slope a few fragments of quartz and micaslate are met with but the great formation of this latter rock z which covers up much of the eastern flank and base of the portillo range cannot be conveniently examined until much lower down at a place called mal paso the micaschist here consists of thick layers of quartz with intervening folia of finelyscaly mica often passing into a substance like black glossy clayslate in one spot the layers of quartz having disappeared the whole mass became converted into glossy clayslate where the folia were best defined they were inclined at a high angle westward that is towards the range the line of junction between the dark micaslate and the coarse red granite was most clearly distinguishable from a vast distance the granite sent many small veins into the micaslate and included some angular fragments of it as the sandstone on the western base has been converted by the red granite into a granular quartzrock so this great formation of micaschist may possibly have been metamorphosed at the same time and by the same means but i think it more probable considering its more perfect metamorphic character and its wellpronounced foliation that it belongs to an anterior epoch connected with the white granites i am the more inclined to this view from having found at the foot of the range the micaschist surrounding a hummock y exclusively composed of white granite near los arenales the mountains on all sides are composed of the micaslate and looking backwards from this point up to the bare gigantic peaks above the view was eminently interesting the colours of the red granite and the black micaslate are so distinct that with a bright light these rocks could be readily distinguished even from the pampas at a level of at least feet below the red granite from being divided by parallel joints has weathered into sharp pinnacles on some of which even on some of the loftiest little caps of micaschist could be clearly seen here and there isolated patches of this rock adhered to the mountainflanks and these often corresponded in height and position on the opposite sides of the immense valleys lower down the schist prevailed more and more with only a few quite small points of granite projecting through looking at the entire eastern face of the portillo range the red colour far exceeds in area the black yet it was scarcely possible to doubt that the granite had once been almost wholly encased by the micaschist at los arenales low down on the eastern flank the micaslate is traversed by several closely adjoining broad dikes parallel to each other and to the foliation of the schist the dikes are formed of three different varieties of rock of which a pale brown feldspathic porphyry with grains of quartz was much the most abundant these dikes with their granules of quartz as well as the micaschist itself strikingly resemble the rocks of the chonos archipelago at a height of about feet above the dikes and perhaps connected with them there is a range of cliffs formed of successive lavastreams a a between and feet in thickness and in places finely columnar the lava consists of darkgrayish harsh rocks intermediate in character between trachyte and basalt containing glassy feldspar olivine and a little mica and sometimes amygdaloidal with zeolite the basis is either quite compact or crenulated with airvesicles arranged in laminæ the streams are separated from each other by beds of fragmentary brown scoriæ firmly cemented together and including a few wellrounded pebbles of lava from their general appearance i suspect that these lavastreams flowed at an ancient period under the pressure of the sea when the atlantic covered the pampas and washed the eastern foot of the cordillera on the opposite and northern side of the valley there is another line of lavacliffs at a corresponding height the valley between being of considerable breadth and as nearly as i could estimate feet in depth this field of lava is confined on both sides by the mountains of micaschist and slopes down rapidly but irregularly to the edge of the pampas where having a thickness of about feet it terminates against a little range of claystone porphyry the valley in this lower part expands into a baylike gentle slope bordered by the cliffs of lava which must certainly once have extended across this wide expanse the inclination of the streams from los arenales to the mouth of the valley is so great that at the time though ignorant of m elie de beaumonts researches on the extremely small slope over which lava can flow and yet retain a compact structure and considerable thickness i concluded that they must subsequently to their flowing have been upheaved and tilted from the mountains of this conclusion i can now entertain not the smallest doubt at the mouth of the valley within the cliffs of the above lavafield there are remnants in the form of separate small hillocks and of lines of low cliffs of a considerable deposit of compact white tuff quarried for filteringstones composed of broken pumice volcanic crystals scales of mica and fragments of lava this mass has suffered much denudation and the hard micaschist has been deeply worn since the period of its deposition and this period must have been subsequent to the denudation of the basaltic lavastreams as attested by their encircling cliffs standing at a higher level at the present day under the existing arid climate ages might roll past without a square yard of rock of any kind being denuded except perhaps in the rarely moistened drainagechannel of the valley must we then look back to that ancient period when the waves of the sea beat against the eastern foot of the cordillera for a power sufficient to denude extensively though superficially this tufaceous deposit soft although it be there remains only to mention some little waterworn hillocks b b a few hundred feet in height and mere molehills compared with the gigantic mountains behind them which rise out of the sloping shinglecovered margin of the pampas the first little range is composed of a brecciated purple porphyritic claystone with obscurely marked strata dipping at to the sw the other ranges consist ofa palecoloured feldspathic porphyrya purple claystone porphyry with grains of quartzand a rock almost exclusively composed of brickred crystals of feldspar these outermost small lines of elevation extend in a nw by w and se by s direction concluding remarks on the portillo rangewhen on the pampas and looking southward and whilst travelling northward i could see for very many leagues the red granite and dark micaschist forming the crest and eastern flank of the portillo line this great range according to dr gillies can be traced with little interruption for miles southward to the r diamante where it unites with the western ranges northward according to this same author it terminates where the r mendoza debouches from the mountains but a little farther north in the eastern part of the cumbre section there are as we shall hereafter see some mountainmasses of a brickred porphyry the last injected amidst many other porphyries and having so close an analogy with the coarse red granite of the portillo line that i am tempted to believe that they belong to the same axis of injection if so the portillo line is at least miles in length its height even in the lowest gap on the road is feet and some of the pinnacles apparently attain an elevation of about feet above the sea the geological history of this grand chain appears to me eminently interesting we may safely conclude that at a former period the valley of tenuyan existed as an arm of the sea about twenty miles in width bordered on one hand by a ridge or chain of islets of the black calcareous shales and purple sandstones of the gypseous formation and on the other hand by a ridge or chain of islets composed of micaslate white granite and perhaps to a partial extent of red granite these two chains whilst thus bordering the old seachannel must have been exposed for a vast lapse of time to alluvial and littoral action during which the rocks were shattered the fragments rounded and the strata of conglomerate accumulated to a thickness of at least or feet the red orthitic granite now forms as we have seen the main part of the portillo chain it is injected in dikes not only into the micaschist and white granites but into the laminated sandstone which it has metamorphosed and which it has thrown off together with the conformably overlying coloured beds and stratified conglomerate at an angle of fortyfive degrees to have thrown off so vast a pile of strata at this angle is a proof that the main part of the red granite whether or not portions as perhaps is probable previously existed was injected in a liquified state after the accumulation both of the laminated sandstone and of the conglomerate this conglomerate we know was accumulated not only after the deposition of the fossiliferous strata of the peuquenes line but after their elevation and longcontinued denudation and these fossiliferous strata belong to the early part of the cretaceous system late therefore in a geological sense as must be the age of the main part of the red granite i can conceive nothing more impressive than the eastern view of this great range as forcing the mind to grapple with the idea of the thousands of thousands of years requisite for the denudation of the strata which originally encased itfor that the fluidified granite was once encased its mineralogical composition and structure and the bold conical shape of the mountainmasses yield sufficient evidence of the encasing strata we see the last vestiges in the coloured beds on the crest in the little caps of micaschist on some of the loftiest pinnacles and in the isolated patches of this same rock at corresponding heights on the now bare and steep flanks the lavastreams at the eastern foot of the portillo are interesting not so much from the great denudation which they have suffered at a comparatively late period as from the evidence they afford by their inclination taken conjointly with their thickness and compactness that after the great range had assumed its present general outline it continued to rise as an axis of elevation the plains extending from the base of the cordillera to the atlantic show that the continent has been upraised in mass to a height of feet and probably to a much greater height for the smooth shinglecovered margin of the pampas is prolonged in a gentle unbroken slope far up many of the great valleys nor let it be assumed that the peuquenes and portillo ranges have undergone only movements of elevation for we shall hereafter see that the bottom of the sea subsided several thousand feet during the deposition of strata occupying the same relative place in the cordillera with those of the peuquenes ridge moreover we shall see from the unequivocal evidence of buried upright trees that at a somewhat later period during the formation of the uspallata chain which corresponds geographically with that of the portillo there was another subsidence of many thousand feet here indeed in the valley of tenuyan the accumulation of the coarse stratified conglomerate to a thickness of or feet offers strong presumptive evidence of subsidence for all existing analogies lead to the belief that large pebbles can be transported only in shallow water liable to be affected by currents and movements of undulationand if so the shallow bed of the sea on which the pebbles were first deposited must necessarily have sunk to allow of the accumulation of the superincumbent strata what a history of changes of level and of wear and tear all since the age of the latter secondary formations of europe does the structure of this one great mountainchain reveal passage of the andes by the cumbre or uspallata pass this pass crosses the andes about sixty miles north of that just described the section given in plate i fig is on the same scale as before namely at onethird of an inch to a mile in distance and one inch to a mile or feet in height like the last section it is a mere sketch and cannot pretend to accuracy though made under favourable circumstances we will commence as before with the western half of which the main range bears the name of the cumbre that is the ridge and corresponds to the peuquenes line in the former section as does the uspallata range though on a much smaller scale to that of the portillo near the point where the river aconcagua debouches on the basin plain of the same name at a height of about feet above the sea we meet with the usual purple and greenish porphyritic claystone conglomerate beds of this nature alternating with numerous compact and amygdaloidal porphyries which have flowed as submarine lavas and associated with great mountainmasses of various injected nonstratified porphyries are prolonged the whole distance up to the cumbre or central ridge one of the commonest stratified porphyries is of a green colour highly amygdaloidal with the various minerals described in the preliminary discussion and including fine tabular crystals of albite the mountainrange north often with a little westing and south the stratification wherever i could clearly distinguish it was inclined westward or towards the pacific and except near the cumbre seldom at angles above only at one spot on this western side on a lofty pinnacle not far from the cumbre i saw strata apparently belonging to the gypseous formation and conformably capping a pile of stratified porphyries hence both in composition and in stratification the structure of the mountains on this western side of the divortium aquarum is far more simple than in the corresponding part of the peuquenes section in the porphyritic claystone conglomerate the mechanical structure and the planes of stratification have generally been much obscured and even quite obliterated towards the base of the series whilst in the upper parts near the summits of the mountains both are distinctly displayed in these upper portions the porphyries are generally lighter coloured in three places x y z masses of andesite are exposed at y this rock contained some quartz but the greater part consisted of andesitic porphyry with only a few welldeveloped crystals of albite and forming a great white mass having the external aspect of granite capped by much dark unstratified porphyry in many parts of the mountains there are dikes of a green colour and other white ones which latter probably spring from underlying masses of andesite the cumbre where the road crosses it is according to mr pentland feet above the sea and the neighbouring peaks composed of dark purple and whitish porphyries some obscurely stratified with a westerly dip and others without a trace of stratification must exceed feet in height descending the eastern slope of the cumbre the structure becomes very complicated and generally differs on the two sides of the east and west line of road and section first we come to a great mass a of nearly vertical singularly contorted strata composed of highly compact red sandstones and of often calcareous conglomerates and penetrated by green yellow and reddish dikes but i shall presently have an opportunity of describing in some detail an analogous pile of strata these vertical beds are abruptly succeeded by others b of apparently nearly the same nature by more metamorphosed alternating with porphyries and limestones these dip for a short space westward but there has been here an extraordinary dislocation which on the north side of the road appears to have determined the excavation of the north and south valley of the r de las cuevas on this northern side of the road the strata b are prolonged till they come in close contact with a jagged lofty mountain d of darkcoloured unstratified intrusive porphyry where the beds have been more highly inclined and still more metamorphosed this mountain of porphyry seems to form a short axis of elevation for south of the road in its line there is a hill c of porphyritic conglomerate with absolutely vertical strata we now come to the gypseous formation i will first describe the structure of the several mountains and then give in one section a detailed account of the nature of the rocks on the north side of the road which here runs in an east and west valley the mountain of porphyry d is succeeded by a hill e formed of the upper gypseous strata tilted at an angle of between and to the west by an uniclinal axis of elevation which does not run parallel to the other neighbouring ranges and which is of short length for on the south side of the valley its prolongation is marked only by a small flexure in a pile of strata inclined by a quite separate axis a little farther on the north and south valley of horcones enters at right angles our line of section its western side is bounded by a hill of gypseous strata f dipping westward at about and its eastern side by a mountain of similar strata g inclined westward at and superimposed by an oblique fault on another mass of the same strata h also inclined westward but at an angle of only about the complicated relation of these three masses f g h is explained by the structure of a great mountainrange lying some way to the north in which a regular anticlinal axis represented in the section by dotted lines is seen with the strata on its eastern side again bending up and forming a distinct uniclinal axis of which the beds marked h form the lower part this great uniclinal line is intersected near the puente del inca by the valley along which the road runs and the strata composing it will be immediately described on the south side of the road in the space corresponding with the mountains e f and g the strata everywhere dip westward generally at an angle of occasionally mounting up to but not in an unbroken line for there are several vertical faults forming separate uniclinal masses all dipping in the same directiona form of elevation common in the cordillera we thus see that within a narrow space the gypseous strata have been unheaved and crushed together by a great uniclinal anticlinal and one lesser uniclinal line e of elevation and that between these three lines and the cumbre in the sandstones conglomerates and porphyritic formation there have been at least two or three other great elevatory axes the uniclinal axis i intersected near the puente del inca of which the strata at h form a part ranges n by w and s by e forming a chain of mountains apparently little inferior in height to the cumbre the strata as we have seen dip at an average angle of to the west the flanks of the mountains are here quite bare and steep affording an excellent section so that i was able to inspect the strata to a thickness of about feet and could clearly distinguish their general nature for feet higher making a total thickness of feet to which must be added about feet of the inferior strata seen a little lower down the valley i will describe this one section in detail beginning at the bottom st the lowest mass is the altered clayslate described in the preliminary discussion and which in this line of section was here first met with lower down the valley at the r de las vacas i had a better opportunity of examining it it is there in some parts well characterised having a distinct nearly vertical tortuous cleavage ranging nw and se and intersected by quartz veins in most parts however it is crystalline and feldspathic and passes into a true greenstone often including grains of quartz the clayslate in its upper half is frequently brecciated the embedded angular fragments being of nearly the same nature with the paste nd several strata of purplish porphyritic conglomerate of no very great thickness rest conformably upon the feldspathic slate a thick bed of fine purple claystone porphyry obscurely brecciated but not of metamorphosed sedimentary origin and capped by porphyritic conglomerate was the lowest bed actually examined in this section at the puente del inca rd a stratum eighty feet thick of hard and very compact impure whitish limestone weathering bright red with included layers brecciated and recemented obscure marks of shell are distinguishable in it th a red quartzose finegrained conglomerate with grains of quartz and with patches of white earthy feldspar apparently due to some process of concretionary crystalline action this bed is more compact and metamorphosed than any of the overlying conglomerates th a whitish cherty limestone with nodules of blueish argillaceous limestone th a white conglomerate with many particles of quartz almost blending into the paste th highly siliceous finegrained white sandstone th and th red and white beds not examined th yellow finegrained thinly stratified magnesian judging from its slow dissolution in acids limestone it includes some white quartz pebbles and little cavities lined with calcareous spar some retaining the form of shells th a bed between twenty and thirty feet thick quite conformable with the underlying ones composed of a hard basis tinged lilacgray porphyritic with numerous crystals of whitish feldspar with black mica and little spots of soft ferruginous matter evidently a submarine lava th yellow magnesian limestone as before partstained purple th a most singular rock basis purplish gray obscurely crystalline easily fusible into a dark green glass not hard thickly speckled with crystals more or less perfect of white carbonate of lime of red hydrous oxide of iron of a white and transparent mineral like analcime and of a green opaque mineral like soapstone the basis is moreover amygdaloidal with many spherical balls of white crystallised carbonate of lime of which some are coated with the red oxide of iron i have no doubt from the examination of a superincumbent stratum that this is a submarine lava though in northern chile some of the metamorphosed sedimentary beds are almost as crystalline and of as varied composition th red sandstone passing in the upper part into a coarse hard red conglomerate feet thick having a calcareous cement and including grains of quartz and broken crystals of feldspar basis infusible the pebbles consist of dull purplish porphyries with some of quartz from the size of a nut to a mans head this is the coarsest conglomerate in this part of the cordillera in the middle there was a white layer not examined th grand thick bed of a very hard yellowishwhite rock with a crystalline feldspathic base including large crystals of white feldspar many little cavities mostly full of soft ferruginous matter and numerous hexagonal plates of black mica the upper part of this great bed is slightly cellular the lower part compact the thickness varied a little in different parts manifestly a submarine lava and is allied to bed th and th dull purplish calcareous finegrained compact sandstones which pass into coarse white conglomerates with numerous particles of quartz th several alternations of red conglomerate purplish sandstone and submarine lava like that singular rock forming bed th a very heavy compact greenishblack stone with a finegrained obviously crystalline basis containing a few specks of white calcareous spar many specks of the crystallised hydrous red oxide of iron and some specks of a green mineral there are veins and nests filled with epidote certainly a submarine lava th many thin strata of compact finegrained pale purple sandstone st gypsum in a nearly pure state about feet in thickness this bed in its concretions of anhydrite and layers of small blackish crystals of carbonate of lime exactly resembles the great gypseous beds in the peuquenes range nd pale purple and reddish sandstone as in bed about feet in thickness rd a thick mass composed of layers often as thin as paper and convoluted of pure gypsum with others very impure of a purplish colour th pure gypsum thick mass th red sandstones of great thickness th pure gypsum of great thickness th alternating layers of pure and impure gypsum of great thickness i was not able to ascend to these few last great strata which compose the neighbouring loftiest pinnacles the thickness from the lowest to the uppermost bed of gypsum cannot be less than feet the beds beneath i estimated at feet and this does not include either the lower parts of the porphyritic conglomerate or the altered clayslate i concèive the total thickness must be about feet i distinctly observed that not only the gypsum but the alternating sandstones and conglomerates were lensshaped and repeatedly thinned out and replaced each other thus in the distance of about a mile a bed feet thick of sandstone between two beds of gypsum thinned out to nothing and disappeared the lower part of this section differs remarkablyin the much greater diversity of its mineralogical compositionin the abundance of calcareous matterin the greater coarseness of some of the conglomeratesand in the numerous particles and well rounded pebbles sometimes of large size of quartzfrom any other section hitherto described in chile from these peculiarities and from the lensform of the strata it is probable that this great pile of strata was accumulated on a shallow and very uneven bottom near some preexisting land formed of various porphyries and quartzrock the formation of porphyritic claystone conglomerate does not in this section attain nearly its ordinary thickness this may be partly attributed to the metamorphic action having been here much less energetic than usual though the lower beds have been affected to a certain degree if it had been as energetic as in most other parts of chile many of the beds of sandstone and conglomerate containing rounded masses of porphyry would doubtless have been converted into porphyritic conglomerate and these would have alternated with and even blended into crystalline and porphyritic strata without a trace of mechanical structurenamely into those which in the present state of the section we see are unquestionably submarine lavas the beds of gypsum together with the red alternating sandstones and conglomerates present so perfect and curious a resemblance with those seen in our former section in the basinvalley of yeso that i cannot doubt the identity of the two formations i may add that a little westward of the p del inca a mass of gypsum passed into a finegrained hard brown sandstone which contained some layers of black calcareous compact shaly rock precisely like that seen in such vast masses on the peuquenes range near the puente del inca numerous fragments of limestone containing some fossil remains were scattered on the ground these fragments so perfectly resemble the limestone of bed no in which i saw impressions of shells that i have no doubt they have fallen from it the yellow magnesian limestone of bed no which also includes traces of shells has a different appearance these fossils as named by m dorbigny consist of gryphæa near to g couloni neocomian formation area perhaps a gabrielis dorbig pal franc neocomian formation mr pentland made a collection of shells from this same spot and von buch considers them as consisting of trigonia resembling in form t costata pholadomya like one found by m dufresnoy near alenccedilon isocardia excentrica voltz identical with that from the jura two of these shells namely the gryphæa and trigonia appear to be identical with species collected by meyen and myself on the peuquenes range and in the opinion of von buch and m dorbigny the two formations belong to the same age i must here add that professor e forbes who has examined my specimens from this place and from the peuquenes range has likewise a strong impression that they indicate the cretaceous period and probably an early epoch in it so that all the palæontologists who have seen these fossils nearly coincide in opinion regarding their age the limestone however with these fossils here lies at the very base of the formation just above the porphyritic conglomerate and certainly several thousand feet lower in the series than the equivalent fossiliferous black shaly rocks high up on the peuquenes range it is well worthy of remark that these shells or at least those of which i saw impressions in the limestone bed no must have been covered up on the least computation by feet of strata now we know from professor e forbess researches that the sea at greater depths than feet becomes exceedingly barren of organic beingsa result quite in accordance with what little i have seen of deepsea soundings hence after this limestone with its shells was deposited the bottom of the sea where the main line of the cordillera now stands must have subsided some thousand feet to allow of the deposition of the superincumbent submarine strata without supposing a movement of this kind it would moreover be impossible to understand the accumulation of the several lower strata of coarse wellrounded conglomerates which it is scarcely possible to believe were spread out in profoundly deep water and which especially those containing pebbles of quartz could hardly have been rounded in submarine craters and afterwards ejected from them as i believe to have been the case with much of the porphyritic conglomerate formation i may add that in professor forbess opinion the aboveenumerated species of mollusca probably did not live at a much greater depth than twenty fathoms that is only feet to return to our section down the valley standing on the great n by w and s by e uniclinal axis of the puente del inca of which a section has just been given and looking northeast great tabular masses of the gypseous formation k k could be seen in the distance very slightly inclined towards the east lower down the valley the mountains are almost exclusively composed of porphyries many of them of intrusive origin and nonstratified others stratified but with the stratification seldom distinguishable except in the upper parts disregarding local disturbances the beds are either horizontal or inclined at a small angle eastwards hence when standing on the plain of uspallata and looking to the west or backwards the cordillera appear composed of huge square nearly horizontal tabular masses so wide a space with such lofty mountains so equably elevated is rarely met with within the cordillera in this line of section the interval between the puente del inca and the neighbourhood of the cumbre includes all the chief axes of dislocation the altered clayslate formation already described is seen in several parts of the valley as far down as las vacas underlying the porphyritic conglomerate at the casa de pujios l there is a hummock of andesitic granite and the stratification of the surrounding mountains here changes from w by s to sw again near the r vacas there is a larger formation of andesitic granite m which sends a meshwork of veins into the superincumbent clayslate and which locally throws off the strata on one side to nw and on the other to se but not at a high angle at the junction the clayslate is altered into finegrained greenstone this granitic axis is intersected by a green dike which i mention because i do not remember having elsewhere seen dikes in this lowest and latest intrusive rock from the r vacas to the plain of uspallata the valley runs ne so that i have had to contract my section it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks as far as the pass of jaula the claystone conglomerate formation in most parts highly porphyritic and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstoneporphyry attains a great thickness there is also much intrusive porphyry from the jaula to the plain the stratification has been in most places obliterated except near the tops of some of the mountains and the metamorphic action has been extremely great in this space the number and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured porphyries injected one into another and intersected by dikes is truly extraordinary i saw one mountain of whitish porphyry from which two huge dikes thinning out branched downwards into an adjoining blackish porphyry another hill of white porphyry which had burst through darkcoloured strata was itself injected by a purple brecciated and recemented porphyry both being crossed by a green dike and both having been upheaved and injected by a granitic dome one brickred porphyry which above the jaula forms an isolated mass in the midst of the porphyritic conglomerate formation and lower down the valley a magnificent group of peaked mountains differs remarkably from all the other porphyries it consists of a red feldspathic base including some rather large crystals of red feldspar numerous large angular grains of quartz and little bits of a soft green mineral answering in most of its characters to soapstone the crystals of red feldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite though from being partially decomposed i was unable to measure them and they certainly are quite unlike the variety so abundantly met with in almost all the other rocks of this line of section and which wherever i tried it cleaved like albite this brickred porphyry appears to have burst through all the other porphyries and numerous red dikes traversing the neighbouring mountains have proceeded from it in some few places however it was intersected by white dikes from this posteriority of intrusive originfrom the close general resemblance between this red porphyry and the red granite of the portillo line the only difference being that the feldspar here is less perfectly granular and that soapstone replaces the mica which is there imperfect and passes into chloriteand from the portillo line a little southward of this point appearing to blend according to dr gillies into the western rangesi am strongly urged to believe as formerly remarked that the grand mountainmasses composed of this brickred porphyry belong to the same axis of injection with the granite of the portillo line if so the injection of this porphyry probably took place as long subsequently to the several axes of elevation in the gypseous formation near the cumbre as the injection of the portillo granite has been shown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the gypseous strata composing the peuquenes range and this interval we have seen must have been a very long one the plain of uspallata has been briefly described in chap x it resembles the basinplains of chile it
