clayslate districts are thus composed the slate near the dikes generally becomes palercoloured harder less fissile of a feldspathic nature and passes into a porphyry or greenstone in one case however it became more fissile of a red colour and contained minute scales of mica which were absent in the unaltered rock on the east side of ponsonby sound some dikes composed of a pale sonorous feldspathic rock porphyritic with a little feldspar were remarkable from their numberthere being within the space of a mile at least one hundredfrom their nearly equalling in bulk the intermediate slateand more especially from the excessive fineness like the finest inlaid carpentry and perfect parallelism of their junctions with the almost vertical laminæ of clayslate i was unable to persuade myself that these great parallel masses had been injected until i found one dike which abruptly thinned out to half its thickness and had one of its walls jagged with fragments of the slate embedded in it in southern t del fuego the clayslate towards its sw boundary becomes much altered and feldspathic thus on wollaston island slate and grauwacke can be distinctly traced passing into feldspathic rocks and greenstones including iron pyrites and epidote but still retaining traces of cleavage with the usual strike and dip one such metamorphosed mass was traversed by large veinlike masses of a beautiful mixture as ascertained by professor miller of green epidote garnets and white calcareous spar on the northern point of this same island there were various ancient submarine volcanic rocks consisting of amygdaloids with dark bole and agateof basalt with decomposed olivineof compact lava with glassy feldsparand of a coarse conglomerate of red scoriæ parts being amygdaloidal with carbonate of lime the southern part of wollaston island and the whole of hermite and horn islands seem formed of cones of greenstone the outlying islets of ii defenso and d raminez are said to consist of porphyritic lava in crossing hardy peninsula the slate still retaining traces of its usual cleavage passes into columnar feldspathic rocks which are succeeded by an irregular tract of trappean and basaltic rocks containing glassy feldspar and much iron pyrites there is also some harsh red claystone porphyry and an almost true trachyte with needles of hornblende and in one spot a curious slaty rock divided into quadrangular columns having a base almost like trachyte with drusy cavities lined by crystals too imperfect according to professor miller to be measured but resembling zeagonite in the midst of these singular rocks no doubt of ancient submarine volcanic origin a high hill of feldspathic clayslate projected retaining its usual cleavage near this point there was a small hillock having the aspect of granite but formed of white albite brilliant crystals of hornblende both ascertained by the reflecting goniometer and mica but with no quartz no recent volcanic district has been observed in any part of tierra del fuego five miles west of the bifurcation of the beagle channel the slateformation instead of becoming as in the more southern parts of tierra del fuego feldspathic and associated with trappean or old volcanic rocks passes by alternations into a great underlying mass of fine gneiss and glossy clayslate which at no great distance is succeeded by a grand formation of micaslate containing garnets the folia of these metamorphic schists strike parallel to the cleavageplanes of the clayslate which have a very uniform direction over the whole of this part of the country the folia however are undulatory and tortuous whilst the cleavagelaminæ of the slate are straight these schists compose the chief mountainchain of southern t del fuego ranging along the north side of the northern arm of the beagle channel in a short wnw and ese line with two points mounts sarmiento and darwin rising to heights of and feet on the southwestern side of this northern arm of the beagle channel the clayslate is seen with its strata dipping from the great chain so that the metamorphic schists here form a ridge bordered on each side by clayslate farther north however to the west of this great range there is no clayslate but only gneiss mica and hornblendic slates resting on great barren hills of true granite and forming a tract about sixty miles in width again westward of these rocks the outermost islands are of trappean formation which from information obtained during the voyages of the adventure and beagle seem together with granite chiefly to prevail along the western coast as far north as the entrance of the st of magellan a little more inland on the eastern side of clarence island and s desolation granite greenstone micaslate and gneiss appear to predominate i am tempted to believe that where the clayslate has been metamorphosed at great depths beneath the surface gneiss micaslate and other allied rocks have been formed but where the action has taken place nearer the surface feldspathic porphyries greenstones etc have resulted often accompanied by submarine volcanic eruptions only one other rock met with in both arms of the beagle channel deserves any notice namely a granulocrystalline mixture of white albite black hornblende ascertained by measurement of the crystals and confirmed by professor miller and more or less of brown mica but without any quartz this rock occurs in large masses closely resembling in external form granite or syenite in the southern arm of the channel one such mass underlies the micaslate on which clayslate was superimposed this peculiar plutonic rock which as we have seen occurs also in hardy peninsula is interesting from its perfect similarity with that hereafter often to be referred to under the name of andesite forming the great injected axes of the cordillera of chile the stratification of the clayslate is generally very obscure whereas the cleavage is remarkably well defined to begin with the extreme eastern parts of t del fuego the cleavageplanes near the st of le maire strike either w and e or wsw and ene and are highly inclined the form of the land including staten island indicates that the axes of elevation have run in this same line though i was unable to distinguish the planes of stratification proceeding westward i accurately examined the cleavage of the clayslate on the northern eastern and western sides thirtyfive miles apart of navarin island and everywhere found the laminæ ranging with extreme regularity wnw and ese seldom varying more than one point of the compass from this direction both on the east and west coasts i crossed at rightangles the cleavageplanes for a space of about eight miles and found them dipping at an angle of between and generally to ssw sometimes to nne and often quite vertically the ssw dip was occasionally succeeded abruptly by a nne dip and this by a vertical cleavage or again by the ssw dip as in a lofty cliff on the eastern end of the island the laminæ of slate were seen to be folded into very large steep curves ranging in the usual wnw line i suspect that the varying and opposite dips may possibly be accounted for by the cleavagelaminæ though to the eye appearing straight being parts of large abrupt curves with their summits cut off and worn down in several places i was particularly struck with the fact that the fine laminæ of the clayslate where cutting straight through the bands of stratification and therefore indisputably true cleavageplanes differed slightly in their greyish and greenish tints of colour in compactness and in some of the laminæ having a rather more jaspery appearance than others i have not seen this fact recorded and it appears to me important for it shows that the same cause which has produced the highly fissile structure has altered in a slight degree the mineralogical character of the rock in the same planes the bands of stratification just alluded to can be distinguished in many places especially in navarin island but only on the weathered surfaces of the slate they consist of slightly undulatory zones of different shades of colour and of thicknesses and resemble the marks more closely than anything else to which i can compare them left on the inside of a vessel by the draining away of some dirty slightly agitated liquor no difference in composition corresponding with these zones could be seen in freshly fractured surfaces in the more level parts of navarin island these bands of stratification were nearly horizontal but on the flanks of the mountains they were inclined from them but in no instance that i saw at a very high angle there can i think be no doubt that these zones which appear only on the weathered surfaces are the last vestiges of the original planes of stratification now almost obliterated by the highly fissile and altered structure which the mass has assumed the clayslate cleaves in the same wnw and ese direction as on navarin island on both sides of the beagle channel on the eastern side of hoste island on the ne side of hardy peninsula and on the northern point of wollaston island although in these two latter localities the cleavage has been much obscured by the metamorphosed and feldspathic condition of the slate within the area of these several islands including navarin island the direction of the stratification and of the mountainchains is very obscure though the mountains in several places appeared to range in the same wnw line with the cleavage the outline of the coast however does not correspond with this line near the bifurcation of the beagle channel where the underlying metamorphic schists are first seen they are foliated with some irregularities in this same wnwline and parallel as before stated to the main mountainaxis of this part of the country westward of this main range the metamorphic schists are foliated though less plainly in the same direction which is likewise common to the zone of old erupted trappean rocks forming the outermost islets hence the area over which the cleavage of the slate and the foliation of the metamorphic schists extends with an average wnw and ese strike is about forty miles in a north and south line and ninety miles in an east and west line further northward near port famine the stratification of the clayslate and of the associated rocks is well defined and there alone the cleavage and strataplanes are parallel a little north of this port there is an anticlinal axis ranging nw or a little more westerly and se south of the port as far as admiralty sound and grabriel channel the outline of the land clearly indicates the existence of several lines of elevation in this same nw direction which i may add is so uniform in the western half of the st of magellan that as captain king has remarked a parallel ruler placed on the map upon the projecting points of the south shore and extended across the strait will also touch the headlands on the opposite coast it would appear from captain kings observations that over all this area the cleavage extends in the same line deepwater channels however in all parts of tierra del fuego have burst through the trammels both of stratification and cleavage most of them may have been formed during the elevation of the land by longcontinued erosion but others for instance the beagle channel which stretches like a narrow canal for miles obliquely through the mountains can hardly have thus originated finally we have seen that in the extreme eastern point of tierra del fuego the cleavage and coastlines extend w and e and even wsw and ene over a large area westward the cleavage the main range of mountains and some subordinate ranges but not the outlines of the coast strike wnw and ese in the central and western parts of the strait of magellan the stratification the mountainranges the outlines of the coast and the cleavage all strike nearly nw and se north of the strait the outline of the coast and the mountains on the mainland run nearly north and south hence we see at this southern point of the continent how gradually the cordillera bend from their north and south course of so many thousand miles in length into an e and even ene direction west coast from the southern chonos islands to northern chilethe first place at which we landed north of the st of magellan was near cape tres montes in lat s between this point and the northern chonos islands a distance of miles the beagle visited several points and specimens were collected for me from the intermediate spaces by lieut stokes the predominant rock is micaslate with thick folia of quartz very frequently alternating with and passing into a chloritic or into a black glossy often striated slightly anthracitic schist which soils paper and becomes white under a great heat and then fuses thin layers of feldspar swelling at intervals into well crystallised kernels are sometimes included in these black schists and i observed one mass of the ordinary black variety insensibly lose its fissile structure and pass into a singular mixture of chlorite epidote feldspar and mica great veins of quartz are numerous in the micaschist wherever these occur the folia are much convoluted in the southern part of the peninsula of tres montes a compact altered feldspathic rock with crystals of feldspar and grains of quartz is the commonest variety this rock exhibits occasionally traces of an original brecciated structure and often presents like the altered state of tierra del fuego traces of cleavageplanes which strike in the same direction with the folia of micaschist farther northward at inchemo island a similar rock gradually becomes granulocrystalline and acquires scales of mica and this variety at s estevan becomes highly laminated and though still exhibiting some rounded grains of quartz passes into the black glossy slightly anthracitic schist which as we have seen repeatedly alternates with and passes into the micaceous and chloritic schists hence all the rocks on this line of coast belong to one series and insensibly vary from an altered feldspathic clayslate into largely foliated true micaschist the cleavage of the homogeneous schists the foliation of those composed of more or less distinct minerals in layers and the planes of alternation of the different varieties or socalled stratification are all parallel and preserve over this miles of coast a remarkable degree of uniformity in direction at the northern end of the group at lows harbour the welldefined folia of micaschist everywhere ranged within eight degrees or less than one point of the compass of n w and s e and even the point of dip varied very little being always directed to the west and generally at an angle of forty degrees i should mention that i had here good opportunities of observation for i followed the naked rock on the beach transversely to the strike for a distance of four miles and a half and all the way attended to the dip along the outer islands for miles south of lows harbour lieutenant stokes during his boatsurvey kindly observed for me the strike of the foliation and he assures me that it was invariably northerly and the dip with one single exception to the west farther south at vallenar bay the strike was almost universally n w and the dip generally at an angle of about to w s but in some places almost vertical still farther south in the neighbourhood of the harbours of anna pink s estevan and s andres and judging from a distance along the southern part of tres montes the foliation and cleavage extended in a line between n to w and s to e and the planes dipped generally westerly but often easterly at angles varying from a gentle inclination to vertical at a pinks harbour where the schists generably dipped easterly wherever the angle became high the strike changed from n w to even as much as n w in an analogous manner at vallenar bay where the dip was westerly viz on an average directed to w s as soon as the angle became very high the planes struck in a line more than west of north the average result from all the observations on this miles of coast is a strike of n w and s e considering that in each specified place my examination extended over an area of several miles and that lieut stokes observations apply to a length of miles i think this remarkable uniformity is pretty well established the prevalence throughout the northern half of this line of coast of a dip in one direction that is to the west instead of being sometimes west and sometimes east is judging from what i have elsewhere seen an unusual circumstance in brazil la plata the falkland islands and tierra del fuego there is generally an obvious relation between the axes of elevation the outline of the coast and the strike of the cleavage or foliation in the chonos archipelago however neither the minor details of the coastline nor the chain of the cordillera nor the subordinate transverse mountainaxes accord with the strike of the foliation and cleavage the seaward face of the numerous islands composing this archipelago and apparently the line of the cordillera range n e whereas as we have just seen the average strike of the foliation is n w there is one interesting exception to the uniformity in the strike of the foliation at the northern point of tres montes lat a bold chain of granite between and feet in height runs from the coast far into the interior in a ese line or more strictly e s and w n in a bay at the northern foot of this range there are a few islets of micaslate with the folia in some parts horizontal but mostly inclined at an average angle of to the north on the northern steep flank of the range there are a few patches some quite isolated and not larger than halfacrown of the micaschist foliated with the same northerly dip on the broad summit as far as the southern crest there is much micaslate in some places even feet in thickness with the folia all dipping north at angles varying from to but sometimes mounting up to the southern flank consists of bare granite the micaslate is penetrated by small veins of granite branching from the main body leaving out of view the prevalent strike of the folia in other parts of this archipelago it might have been expected that here they would have dipped n e that is directly from the ridge and considering its abruptness at a high inclination but the real dip as we have just seen both at the foot and on the northern flank and over the entire summit is at a small angle and directed nearly due north from these considerations it occurred to me that perhaps we here had the novel and curious case of already inclined laminæ obliquely tilted at a subsequent period by the granitic axis mr hopkins so well known from his mathematical investigations has most kindly calculated the problem the proposition sent wastake a district composed of laminæ dipping at an angle of to w s and let an axis of elevation traverse it in an e s line what will the position of the laminæ be on the northern flank after a tilt we will first suppose of mr hopkins informs me that the angle of the dip will be and its direction to north west by varying the supposed angle of the tilt our previously inclined folia can be thrown into any angle between which is the least possible angle and but if a small inclination be thus given to them their point of dip will depart far from the north and therefore not accord with the actual position of the folia of micaschist on our granitic range hence it appears very difficult without varying considerably the elements of the problem thus to explain the anomalous strike and dip of the foliated micaschist especially in those parts namely at the base of the range where the folia are almost horizontal mr hopkins however adds that great irregularities and lateral thrusts might be expected in every great line of elevation and that these would account for considerable deviations from the calculated results considering that the granitic axis as shown by the veins has indisputably been injected after the perfect formation of the micaslate and considering the uniformity of the strike of the folia throughout the rest of the archipelago i cannot but still think that their anomalous position at this one point is someway directly and mechanically related to the intrusion of this wnw and ese mountainchain of granite dikes are frequent in the metamorphic schists of the chonos islands and seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient volcanic rocks on the southwestern coast of t del fuego at s andres i observed in the space of halfamile seven broad parallel dikes composed of three varieties of trap running in a nw and se line parallel to the neighbouring mountainranges of altered clayslate but they must be of long subsequent origin to these mountains for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the last chapter north of tres montes i noticed three dikes differing from each other in composition one of them having an euritic base including large octagons of quartz these dikes as well as several of porphyritic greenstone at vallenar bay extended ne and sw nearly at right angles to the foliation of the schists but in the line of their joints at lows harbour however a set of great parallel dikes one ninety yards and another sixty yards in width have been guided by the foliation of the micaschist and hence are inclined westward at an angle of these dikes are formed of various porphyritic traps some of which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded grains of quartz a porphyritic trap of this latter kind passed in one of the dikes into a most curious hornstone perfectly white with a waxy fracture and pellucid edges fusible and containing many grains of quartz and specks of iron pyrites in the ninety yard dike several large apparently now quite isolated fragments of micaslate were embedded but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the surrounding solid rock no doubt these now separate fragments originally formed wedgeshaped depending portions of a continuous vault or crust once extending over the dike but since worn down and denuded chiloe valdivia concepcionin chiloe a great formation of micaschist strikingly resembles that of the chonos islands for a space of eleven miles on the se coast the folia were very distinct though slightly convoluted and ranged within a point of nnw and sse dipping either ene or more commonly wsw at an average angle of in one spot however at and therefore decidedly at a lesser inclination than amongst the chonos islands on the west and northwestern shores the foliation was often obscure though where best defined it ranged within a point of n by w and s by e dipping either easterly or westerly at varying and generally very small angles hence from the southern part of tres montes to the northern end of chiloe a distance of miles we have closely allied rocks with their folia striking on an average in the same direction namely between n and w again at valdivia we meet with the same micaschist exhibiting nearly the same mineralogical passages as in the chonos archipelago often however becoming more ferruginous and containing so much feldspar as to pass into gneiss the folia were generally well defined but nowhere else in south america did i see them varying so much in direction this seemed chiefly caused by their forming parts as i could sometimes distinctly trace of large flat curves nevertheless both near the settlement and towards the interior a nw and se strike seemed more frequent than any other direction the angle of the dip was generally small at concepcion a highly glossy clayslate had its cleavage often slightly curvilinear and inclined seldom at a high angle towards various points of the compass but here as at valdivia a nw and se strike seemed to be the most frequent one in certain spots large quartz veins were numerous and near them the cleavage as was the case with the foliation of the schists in the chonos archipelago became extremely tortuous at the northern end of quiriquina island in the bay of conception at least eight rudely parallel dikes which have been guided to a certain extent by the cleavage of the slate occur within the space of a quarter of a mile they vary much in composition resembling in many respects the dikes at lows harbour the greater number consist of feldspathic porphyries sometimes containing grains of quartz one however was black and brilliant like an augitic rock but really formed of feldspar others of a feldspathic nature were perfectly white with either an earthly or crystalline fracture and including grains and regular octagons of quartz these white varieties passed into ordinary greenstones although both here and at lows harbour the nature of the rock varied considerably in the same dike yet i cannot but think that at these two places and in other parts of the chonos group where the dikes though close to each other and running parallel are of different composition that they must have been formed at different periods in the case of quiriquina this is a rather interesting conclusion for these eight parallel dikes cut through the metamorphic schists in a nw and se line and since their injection the overlying cretaceous or tertiary strata have been tilted whilst still under the sea from a nw by n and se by s line and again during the great earthquake of february the ground in this neighbourhood was fissured in nw and se lines and from the manner in which buildings were thrown down it was evident that the surface undulated in this same direction central and northern chilenorthward of concepcion as far as copiapo the shores of the pacific consist with the exception of some small tertiary basins of gneiss micaschist altered clayslate granite greenstone and syenite hence the coast from tres montes to copiapo a distance of miles and i have reason to believe for a much greater space is almost similarly constituted near valparaiso the prevailing rock is gneiss generally including much hornblende concretionary balls formed of feldspar hornblende and mica from two to three feet in diameter are in very many places conformably enfolded by the foliated gneiss veins of quartz and feldspar including black schorl and wellcrystallised epidote are numerous epidote likewise occurs in the gneiss in thin layers parallel to the foliation of the mass one large vein of a coarse granitic character was remarkable from in one part quite changing its character and insensibly passing into a blackish porphyry including acicular crystals of glassy feldspar and of hornblende i have never seen any other such case i shall in the few following remarks on the rocks of chile allude exclusively to their foliation and cleavage in the gneiss round valparaiso the strike of the foliation is very variable but i think about n by w and s by e is the commonest direction this likewise holds good with the cleavage of the altered feldspathic clayslates occasionally met with on the coast for ninety miles north of valparaiso some feldspathic slate alternating with strata of claystone porphyry in the bell of quillota and at jajuel and therefore perhaps belonging to a later period than the metamorphic schists on the coast cleaved in this same direction in the eastern cordillera in the portillo pass there is a grand mass of micaslate foliated in a north and south line and with a high westerly dip in the uspallata range clayslate and grauwacke have a highly inclined nearly north and south cleavage though in some parts the strike is irregular in the main or cumbre range the direction of the cleavage in the feldspathic clayslate is nw and se between coquimbo and guasco there are two considerable formations of micaslate in one of which the rock passed sometimes into common clayslate and sometimes into a glossy black variety very like that in the chonos archipelago the folia and cleavage of these rocks ranged between n and nw by n and s and sw by s near the port of guasco several varieties of altered clayslate have a quite irregular cleavage between guasco and copiapo there are some siliceous and talcaceous slates cleaving in a north and south line with an easterly dip of between and high up also the main valley of copiapo there is micaslate with a high easterly dip in the whole space between valparaiso and copiapo an easterly dip is much more common than an opposite or westerly one concluding remarks on cleavage and foliation in this southern part of the southern hemisphere we have seen that the cleavagelaminæ range over wide areas with remarkable uniformity cutting straight through the planes of stratification but yet being parallel in strike to the main axes of elevation and generally to the outlines of the coast the dip however is as variable both in angle and in direction that is sometimes being inclined to the one side and sometimes to the directly opposite side as the strike is uniform in all these respects there is a close agreement with the facts given by professor sedgwick in his celebrated memoir in the geological transactions and by sir r i murchison in his various excellent discussions on this subject the falkland islands and more especially tierra del fuego offer striking instances of the lines of cleavage the principal axes of elevation and the outlines of the coast gradually changing together their courses the direction which prevails throughout tierra del fuego and the falkland islands namely from west with some northing to east with some southing is also common to the several ridges in northern patagonia and in the western parts of banda oriental in this latter province in the sierra tapalguen and in the western falkland island the w by n or wnw and ese ridges are crossed at right angles by others ranging nne and ssw the fact of the cleavagelaminæ in the clayslate of tierra del fuego where seen cutting straight through the planes of stratification and where consequently there could be no doubt about their nature differing slightly in colour texture and hardness appears to me very interesting in a thick mass of laminated feldspathic and altered clayslate interposed between two great strata of porphyritic conglomerate in central chile and where there could be but little doubt about the bedding i observed similar slight differences in composition and likewise some distinct thin layers of epidote parallel to the highly inclined cleavage of the mass again i incidentally noticed in north wales where glaciers had passed over the truncated edges of the highly inclined laminæ of clayslate that the surface though smooth was worn into small parallel undulations caused by the component laminæ being of slightly different degrees of hardness with reference to the slates of north wales professor sedgwick describes the planes of cleavage as coated over with chlorite and semicrystalline matter which not only merely define the planes in question but strike in parallel flakes through the whole mass of the rock in some of those glossy and hard varieties of clayslate which may often be seen passing into micaschist it has appeared to me that the cleavageplanes were formed of excessively thin generally slightly convoluted folia composed of microscopically minute scales of mica from these several facts and more especially from the case of the clayslate in tierra del fuego it must i think be concluded that the same power which has impressed on the slate its fissile structure or cleavage has tended to modify its mineralogical character in parallel planes let us now turn to the foliation of the metamorphic schists a subject which has been much less attended to as in the case of cleavagelaminæ the folia preserve over very large areas a uniform strike thus humboldt found for a distance of miles in venezuela and indeed over a much larger space gneiss granite mica and clayslate striking very uniformly ne and sw and dipping at an angle of between and to nw it would even appear from the facts given in this chapter that the metamorphic rocks throughout the northeastern part of s america are generally foliated within two points of ne and sw over the eastern parts of banda oriental the foliation strikes with a high inclination very uniformly nne to ssw and over the western parts in a w by n and e by s line for a space of miles on the shores of the chonos and chiloe islands we have seen that the foliation seldom deviates more than a point of the compass from a n w and s e strike as in the case of cleavage the angle of the dip in foliated rocks is generally high but variable and alternates from one side of the line of strike to the other side sometimes being vertical in the northern chonos islands however the folia are inclined almost always to the west in nearly the same manner the cleavagelaminæ in southern tierra del fuego certainly dip much more frequently to ssw than to the opposite point in eastern banda oriental in parts of brazil and in some other districts the foliation runs in the same direction with the mountainranges and adjoining coastlines amongst the chonos islands however this coincidence fails and i have given my reasons for suspecting that one granitic axis has burst through and tilted the already inclined folia of micaschist in the case of cleavage the coincidence between its strike and that of the main stratification seems sometimes to fail foliation and cleavage resemble each other in the planes winding round concretions and in becoming tortuous where veins of quartz abound on the flanks of the mountains both in tierra del fuego and in other countries i have observed that the cleavageplanes frequently dip at a high angle inwards and this was long ago observed by von buch to be the case in norway this fact is perhaps analogous to the folded fanlike or radiating structure in the metamorphic schists of the alps in which the folia in the central crests are vertical and on the two flanks inclined inwards where masses of fissile and foliated rocks alternate together the cleavage and foliation in all cases which i have seen are parallel where in one district the rocks are fissile and in another adjoining district they are foliated the planes of cleavage and foliation are likewise generally parallel this is the case with the feldspathic homogeneous slates in the southern part of the chonos group compared with the fine foliated micaschists of the northern part so again the clayslate of the whole eastern side of tierra del fuego cleaves in exactly the same line with the foliated gneiss and micaslate of the western coast other analogous instances might have been adduced with respect to the origin of the folia of quartz mica feldspar and other minerals composing the metamorphic schists professor sedgwick mr lyell and most authors believe that the constituent parts of each layer were separately deposited as sediment and then metamorphosed this view in the majority of cases i believe to be quite untenable in those not uncommon instances where a mass of clayslate in approaching granite gradually passes into gneiss we clearly see that folia of distinct minerals can originate through the metamorphosis of a homogeneous fissile rock the deposition it may be remarked of numberless alternations of pure quartz and of the elements of mica or feldspar does not appear a probable event in those districts in which the metamorphic schists are foliated in planes parallel to the cleavage of the rocks in an adjoining district are we to believe that the folia are due to sedimentary layers whilst the cleavagelaminæ though parallel have no relation whatever to such planes of deposition on this view how can we reconcile the vastness of the areas over which the strike of the foliation is uniform with what we see in disturbed districts composed of true strata and especially how can we understand the high and even vertical dip throughout many wide districts which are not mountainous and throughout some as in western banda oriental which are not even hilly are we to admit that in the northern part of the chonos archipelago micaslate was first accumulated in parallel horizontal folia to a thickness of about four geographical miles and then upturned at an angle of forty degrees whilst in the southern part of this same archipelago the cleavagelaminæ of closely allied rocks which none would imagine had ever been horizontal dip at nearly the same angle to nearly the same point seeing then that foliated schists indisputably are sometimes produced by the metamorphosis of homogeneous fissile rocks seeing that foliation and cleavage are so closely analogous in the several aboveenumerated respects seeing that some fissile and almost homogeneous rocks show incipient mineralogical changes along the planes of their cleavage and that other rocks with a fissile structure alternate with and pass into varieties with a foliated structure i cannot doubt that in most cases foliation and cleavage are parts of the same process in cleavage there being only an incipient separation of the constituent minerals in foliation a much more complete separation and crystallisation the fact often referred to in this chapter of the foliation and the socalled strata in the metamorphic seriesthat is the alternating masses of different varieties of gneiss micaschist and hornblendeslate cbeing parallel to each other at first appears quite opposed to the view that the folia have no relation to the planes of original deposition where the socalled beds are not very thick and of widely different mineralogical composition from each other i do not think that there is any difficulty in supposing that they have originated in an analogous manner with the separate folia we should bear in mind what thick strata in ordinary sedimentary masses have obviously been formed by a concretionary process in a pile of volcanic rocks on the island of ascension there are strata differing quite as much in appearance as the ordinary varieties of the metamorphic schists which undoubtedly have been produced not by successive flowings of lava but by internal molecular changes near monte video where the stratification as it would be called of the metamorphic series is in most parts particularly well developed being as usual parallel to the foliation we have seen that a mass of chloritic schist netted with quartzveins is entangled in gneiss in such a manner as to show that it had certainly originated in some process of segregation again in another spot the gneiss tended to pass into hornblendic schist by alternating with layers of quartz but these layers of quartz almost certainly had never been separately deposited for they were absolutely continuous with the numerous intersecting veins of quartz i have never had an opportunity of tracing for any distance along the line both of strike and of dip the socalled beds in the metamorphic schists but i strongly suspect that they would not be found to extend with the same character very far in the line either of their dip or strike hence i am led to believe that most of the socalled beds are of the nature of complex folia and have not been separately deposited of course this view cannot be extended to thick masses included in the metamorphic series which are of totally different composition from the adjoining schists and which are far extended as is sometimes the case with quartz and marble these must generally be of the nature of true strata such strata however will almost always strike in the same direction with the folia owing to the axes of elevation being in most countries parallel to the strike of the foliation but they will generally dip at a different angle from that of the foliation and the angle of the foliation in itself almost always varies much hence in crossing a metamorphosed schistose district it would require especial attention to discriminate between true strata of deposition and complex foliated masses the mere presence of true strata in the midst of a set of metamorphic schists is no argument that the foliation is of sedimentary origin without it be further shown in each case that the folia not only strike but dip throughout in parallel planes with those of the true stratification as in some cases it appears that where a fissile rock has been exposed to partial metamorphic action for instance from the irruption of granite the foliation has supervened on the already existing cleavageplanes so perhaps in some instances the foliation of a rock may have been determined by the original planes of deposition or of oblique currentlaminæ i have however myself never seen such a case and i must maintain that in most extensive metamorphic areas the foliation is the extreme result of that process of which cleavage is the first effect that foliation may arise without any previous structural arrangement in the mass we may infer from injected and therefore once liquefied rocks both of volcanic and plutonic origin sometimes having a grain as expressed by professor sedgwick and sometimes being composed of distinct folia or laminæ of different compositions in the earlier chapters of the present work i have given several instances of this structure in volcanic rocks and it is not uncommonly seen in plutonic massesthus in the cordillera of chile there are gigantic mountainlike masses of red granite which have been injected whilst liquefied and which nevertheless display in parts a decidedly laminar structure finally we have seen that the planes of cleavage and of foliation that is of the incipient process and of the final result generally strike parallel to the principal axes of elevation and to the outline of the land the strike of the axes of elevation that is of the lines of fissures with the strata on their edges upturned according to the reasoning of mr hopkins is determined by the form of the area undergoing changes of level and the consequent direction of the lines of tension and fissure now in that remarkable pile of volcanic rocks at ascension which has several times been alluded to and in some other cases i have endeavoured to show that the lamination of the several varieties and their alternations have been caused by the moving mass just before its final consolidation having been subjected as in a glacier to planes of different tension this difference in the tension affecting the crystalline and concretionary processes one of the varieties of rock thus produced at ascension at first sight singularly resembles a finegrained gneiss it consists of quite straight and parallel zones of excessive tenuity of more and less coloured crystallised feldspar of distinct crystals of quartz diopside and oxide of iron these considerations notwithstanding the experiments made by mr fox showing the influence of electrical currents in producing a structure like that of cleavage and notwithstanding the apparently inexplicable variation both in the inclination of the cleavagelaminæ and in their dipping first to one side and then to the other side of the line of strike lead me to suspect that the planes of cleavage and foliation are intimately connected with the planes of different tension to which the area was long subjected after the main fissures or axes of upheavement had been formed but before the final consolidation of the mass and the total cessation of all molecular movement chapter xiv central chile structure of the cordillera central chilebasal formations of the

chain the district between the cordillera and the pacific on a rude average is from about eighty to one hundred miles in width it is crossed by many chains of mountains of which the principal ones in the latitude of valparaiso and southward of it range nearly north and south but in the more northern parts of the province they run in almost every possible direction near the pacific the mountainranges are generally formed of syenite or granite or of an allied euritic porphyry in the low country besides these granitic rocks and greenstone and much gneiss there are especially northward of valparaiso some considerable districts of true clayslate with quartz veins passing into a feldspathic and porphyritic slate there is also some grauwacke and quartzose and jaspery rocks the latter occasionally assuming the character of the basis of claystone porphyry trapdikes are numerous nearer the cordillera the ranges such as those of s fernando the prado and aconcagua are formed partly of granitic rocks and partly of purple porphyritic conglomerates claystone porphyry greenstone porphyry and other rocks such as we shall immediately see form the basal strata of the main cordillera in the more northern parts of chile this porphyritic series extends over large tracts of country far from the cordillera and even in central chile such occasionally occur in outlying positions i will describe the campana of quillota which stands only fifteen miles from the pacific as an instance of one of these outlying masses this hill is conspicuous from rising to the height of feet its summit shows a nucleus uncovered for a height of feet of fine greenstone including epidote and octahedral magnetic iron ore its flanks are formed of great strata of porphyritic claystone conglomerate associated with various true porphyries and amygdaloids alternating with thick masses of a highly feldspathic sometimes porphyritic palecoloured slaty rock with its cleavagelaminæ dipping inwards at a high angle at the base of the hill there are syenites a granular mixture of quartz and feldspar and harsh quartzose rocks all belonging to the basal metamorphic series i may observe that at the foot of several hills of this class where the porphyries are first seen as near s fernando the prado las vacas c similar harsh quartzose rocks and granular mixtures of quartz and feldspar occur as if the more fusible constituent parts of the granitic series had been drawn off to form the overlying porphyries in central chile the flanks of the main cordillera into which i penetrated by four different valleys generally consist of distinctly stratified rocks the strata are inclined at angles varying from sometimes even under ten to twenty degrees very rarely exceeding forty degrees in some however of the quite small exterior spurlike ridges the inclination was not unfrequently greater the dip of the strata in the main outer lines was usually outwards or from the cordillera but in northern chile frequently inwardsthat is their bassetedges fronted the pacific dikes occur in extraordinary numbers in the great central loftiest ridges the strata as we shall presently see are almost always highly inclined and often vertical before giving a detailed account of my two sections across the cordillera it will i think be convenient to describe the basal strata as seen often to a thickness of or feet on the flanks of the outer lines basal strata of the cordillerathe prevailing rock is a purplish or greenish porphyritic claystone conglomerate the embedded fragments vary in size from mere particles to blocks as much as six or eight inches rarely more in diameter in many places where the fragments were minute the signs of aqueous deposition were unequivocally distinct where they were large such evidence could rarely be detected the basis is generally porphyritic with perfect crystals of feldspar and resembles that of a true injected claystone porphyry often however it has a mechanical or sedimentary aspect and sometimes as at jajuel is jaspery the included fragments are either angular or partially or quite rounded in some parts the rounded in others the angular fragments prevail and usually both kinds are mixed together hence the word breccia ought strictly to be appended to the term porphyritic conglomerate the fragments consist of many varieties of claystone porphyry usually of nearly the same colour with the surrounding basis namely purplishreddish brownish mottled or bright green occasionally fragments of a laminated palecoloured feldspathic rock like altered clayslate are included as are sometimes grains of quartz but only in one instance in central chile namely at the mines of jajuel a few pebbles of quartz i nowhere observed mica in this formation and rarely hornblende where the latter mineral did occur i was generally in doubt whether the mass really belonged to this formation or was of intrusive origin calcareous spar occasionally occurs in small cavities and nests and layers of epidote are common in some few places in the finergrained varieties for instance at quillota there were short interrupted layers of earthy feldspar which could be traced exactly as at port desire passing into large crystals of feldspar i doubt however whether in this instance the layers had ever been separately deposited as tufaceous sediment all the varieties of porphyritic conglomerates and breccias pass into each other and by innumerable gradations into porphyries no longer retaining the least trace of mechanical origin the transition appears to have been effected much more easily in the finergrained than in the coarsergrained varieties in one instance near cauquenes i noticed that a porphyritic conglomerate assumed a spheroidal structure and tended to become columnar besides the porphyritic conglomerates and the perfectly characterized porphyries of metamorphic origin there are other porphyries which though differing not at all or only slightly in composition certainly have had a different origin these consist of pink or purple claystone porphyries sometimes including grains of quartzof greenstone porphyry and of other dusky rocks all generally porphyritic with fine large tabular opaque crystals often placed crosswise of feldspar cleaving like albite judging from several measurements and often amygdaloidal with silex agate carbonate of lime green and brown bole these several porphyritic and amygdaloidal varieties never show any signs of passing into masses of sedimentary origin they occur both in great and small intrusive masses and likewise in strata alternating with those of the porphyritic conglomerate and with the planes of junction often quite distinct yet not seldom blended together in some of these intrusive masses the porphyries exhibit more or less plainly a brecciated structure like that often seen in volcanic masses these brecciated porphyries could generally be distinguished at once from the metamorphosed porphyritic brecciaconglomerates by all the fragments being angular and being formed of the same variety and by the absence of every trace of aqueous deposition one of the porphyries above specified namely the greenstone porphyry with large tabular crystals of albite is particularly abundant and in some parts of the cordillera as near st jago seemed more common even than the purplish porphyritic conglomerate numerous dikes likewise consist of this greenstone porphyry others are formed of various finegrained trappean rocks but very few of claystone porphyry i saw no true basaltic dikes in several places in the lower part of the series but not everywhere thick masses of a highly feldspathic often porphyritic slaty rock occur interstratified with the porphyritic conglomerate i believe in one or two cases blackish limestone has been found in a similar position the feldspathic rock is of a pale grey or greenish colour it is easily fusible where porphyritic the crystals of feldspar are generally small and vitreous it is distinctly laminated and sometimes includes parallel layers of epidote the lamination appears to be distinct from stratification occasionally this rock is somewhat carious and at one spot namely at the c of quillota it had a brecciated structure near the mines of jajuel in a thick stratum of this feldspathic porphyritic slate there was a layer of hard blackish siliceous infusible compact clayslate such as i saw nowhere else at the same place i was able to follow for a considerable distance the junction between the slate and the conformably underlying porphyritic conglomerate and they certainly passed gradually into each other wherever these slaty feldspathic rocks abound greenstone seems common at the c of quillota a bed of wellcrystallized greenstone lay conformably in the midst of the feldspathic slate with the upper and lower junctions passing insensibly into it from this fact and from the frequently porphyritic condition of the slate i should perhaps have considered this rock as an erupted one like certain laminated feldspathic lavas in the trachytic series had i not seen in t del fuego how readily true clayslate becomes feldspathic and porphyritic and had i not seen at jajuel the included layer of black siliceous clayslate which no one could have thought of igneous origin the gentle passage of the feldspathic slate at jajuel into the porphyritic conglomerate which is certainly of aqueous origin should also be taken into account the alternating strata of porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate and with the occasionally included beds of feldspathic slate together make a grand formation in several places within the cordillera i estimated its thickness at from to feet it extends for many hundred miles forming the western flank of the chilian cordillera and even at iquique in peru miles north of the southernmost point examined by me in chile the coastescarpment which rises to a height of between and feet is thus composed in several parts of northern chile this formation extends much farther towards the pacific over the granitic and metamorphic lower rocks than it does in central chile but the main cordillera may be considered as its central line and its breadth in an east and west direction is never great at first the origin of this thick massive long but narrow formation appeared to me very anomalous whence were derived and how were dispersed the innumerable fragments often of large size sometimes angular and sometimes rounded and almost invariably composed of porphyritic rocks seeing that the interstratified porphyries are never vesicular and often not even amygdaloidal we must conclude that the pile was formed in deep water how then came so many fragments to be well rounded and so many to remain angular sometimes the two kinds being equally mingled sometimes one and sometimes the other preponderating that the claystone greenstone and other porphyries and amygdaloids which lie conformably between the beds of conglomerate are ancient submarine lavas i think there can be no doubt and i believe we must look to the craters whence these streams were erupted as the source of the brecciaconglomerate after a great explosion we may fairly imagine that the water in the heated and scarcely quiescent crater would remain for a considerable time sufficiently agitated to triturate and round the loose fragments lying within it these rounded fragments few or many in number would be shot forth at the next eruption associated with a few or many angular fragments according to the strength of the explosion the porphyritic conglomerate being purple or reddish even when alternating with duskycoloured or bright green porphyries and amygdaloids is probably an analogous circumstance to the scoriæ of the blackish basalts being often bright red the ancient submarine orifices whence the porphyries and their fragments were ejected having been arranged in a band like most still active volcanos accounts for the thickness the narrowness and linear extension of this formation this whole great pile of rock has suffered much metamorphic action as is very obvious in the gradual formation and appearance of the crystals of albitic feldspar and of epidotein the blending together of the fragmentsin the appearance of a laminated structure in the feldspathic slateand lastly in the disappearance of the planes of stratification which could sometimes be seen on the same mountain quite distinct in the upper part less and less plain on the flanks and quite obliterated at the base partly owing to this metamorphic action and partly to the close relationship in origin i have seen fragments of porphyriestaken from a metamorphosed conglomeratefrom a neighbouring stream of lavafrom the nucleus or centre as it appeared to me of the whole submarine volcanoand lastly from an intrusive mass of quite subsequent origin all of which were absolutely undistinguishable in external characters one other rock of plutonic origin and highly important in the history of the cordillera from having been injected in most of the great axes of elevation and from having apparently been instrumental in metamorphosing the superincumbent strata may be conveniently described in this preliminary discussion it has been called by some authors andesite it mainly consists of wellcrystallised white albite as determined with the goniometer in numerous specimens both by professor miller and myself of less perfectly crystallised green hornblende often associated with much mica with chlorite and epidote and occasionally with a few grains of quartz in one instance in northern chile i found crystals of orthitic or potash feldspar mingled with those of albite where the mica and quartz are abundant the rock cannot be distinguished from granite and it may be called andesitic granite where these two minerals are quite absent and when as often then happens the crystals of albite are imperfect and blend together the rock may be called andesitic porphyry which bears nearly the same relation to andesitic granite that euritic porphyry does to common granite these andesitic rocks form mountain masses of a white colour which in their general outline and appearancein their jointsin their occasionally including darkcoloured angular fragments apparently of some preexisting rockand in the great dikes branching from them into the superincumbent strata manifest a close and striking resemblance to masses of common granite and syenite i never however saw in these andesitic rocks those granitic veins of segregation which are so common in true granites we have seen that andesite occurs in three places in tierra del fuego in chile from st fernando to copiapo a distance of miles i found it under most of the axes of elevation in a collection of specimens from the cordillera of lima in peru i immediately recognised it and erman states that it occurs in eastern kamtschatka from its wide range and from the important part it has played in the history of the cordillera i think this rock has well deserved its distinct name of andesite the few still active volcanos in chile are confined to the central and loftiest ranges of the cordillera and volcanic matter such as appears to have been of subaërial eruption is everywhere rare according to meyen there is a hill of pumice high up the valley of the maypu and likewise a trachytic formation at colina a village situated north of st jago close to this latter city there are two hills formed of a pale feldspathic porphyry remarkable from being doubly columnar great cylindrical columns being subdivided into smaller four or five sided ones and a third hillock cerro blanco is formed of a fragmentary mass of rock which i believe to be of volcanic origin intermediate in character between the above feldspathic porphyry and common trachyte and containing needles of hornblende
