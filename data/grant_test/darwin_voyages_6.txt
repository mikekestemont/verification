we rode another stage and crossed the monge another brackish stream bearing the dregs of the washings of the pampas october d we passed through corunda which from the luxuriance of its gardens was one of the prettiest villages i saw from this point to st fe the road is not very safe the western side of the parana further northward ceases to be inhabited and hence the indians sometimes come down and waylay travellers the nature of the country also favours this for instead of a grassy plain there is an open woodland composed of low prickly mimosas we passed some houses that had been ransacked and since deserted we saw also a spectacle which my guides viewed with high satisfaction it was the skeleton of an indian with the dried skin hanging on the bones suspended to the branch of a tree in the morning we arrived at st fe i was surprised to observe how great a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of latitude between this place and buenos ayres had caused this was evident from the dress and complexion of the menfrom the increased size of the ombutreesthe number of new cacti and other plantsand especially from the birds in the course of an hour i remarked halfadozen of the latter which i had never seen at buenos ayres considering that there is no natural boundary between the two places and that the character of the country is nearly similar the difference was much greater than i should have expected october d and thi was confined to my bed by a headach for these two days a goodnatured old woman who attended me wished me to try many odd remedies a common practice is to bind an orangeleaf or a bit of black plaster to each temple and a still more general plan is to split a bean into halves moisten them and place one on each temple where they will easily adhere it is not thought proper ever to remove the beans or plaster but to allow them to drop off and sometimes if a man with patches on his head is asked what is the matter he will answer i had a headache the day before yesterday st fe is a quiet little town and is kept clean and in good order the governor lopez was a common soldier at the time of the revolution but has now been seventeen years in power this stability of government is owing to his tyrannical habits for tyranny seems as yet better adapted to these countries than republicanism the governors favourite occupation is hunting indians a short time since he slaughtered fortyeight and sold the children at the rate of three or four pounds apiece october thwe crossed the parana to st fe bajada a town on the opposite shore the passage took some hours as the river here consisted of a labyrinth of small streams separated by low wooded islands i had a letter of introduction to an old catalonian spaniard who treated me with the most uncommon hospitality the bajada is the capital of entre rios in the town contained inhabitants and the province yet few as they are none have suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions they boast here of representatives ministers a standing army and governors so it is no wonder that they have their revolutions at some future day this must be one of the richest countries of la plata the soil is varied and productive and its almost insular form gives it two grand lines of communication by the rivers parana and uruguay i was delayed here five days and employed myself in examining the geology of the surrounding country which was very interesting we here see beds of sand clay and limestone containing seashells and sharks teeth passing above into an indurated marl and from that into the red clayey earth of the pampas with its calcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial animals this vertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure saltwater gradually encroached on and at last becoming the bed of a muddy estuary into which floating carcasses were swept i found near the bajada a large piece nearly four feet across of the giant armadillolike case also a molar tooth of a mastodon and fragments of very many bones the greater number of which were rotten and as soft as clay a tooth which i discovered by one point projecting from the side of a bank interested me much for i at once perceived that it had belonged to a horse feeling much surprise at this i carefully examined its geological position and was compelled to come to the conclusion that a horse which cannot from a comparison of the tooth alone be distinguished from the existing species lived as a contemporary with the various great monsters that formerly inhabited south america mr owen and myself at the college of surgeons compared this tooth with a fragment of another probably belonging to the toxodon which was embedded at the distance only of a few yards in the same earthy mass no sensible difference in their state of decay could be perceived they were both tender and partially stained red if the horse did not coexist with the toxodon the tooth must by some accident not very easily understood have been embedded within the last three centuries the period of the introduction of the horse with the remains of those animals which ages since perished when the pampas was covered by the waters of the sea now i may ask will any one credit that two teeth of nearly equal size buried in the same substance close together after a period of so vast an inequality could exist in the same condition of decay we must conclude otherwise certainly it is a marvellous event in the history of animals that a native kind should have disappeared to be succeeded in after ages by the countless herds introduced with the spanish colonist but our surprise should be modified when it is already known that the remains of the mastodon angustidens the tooth formerly alluded to as embedded near that of the horse probably belonged to this species have been found both in south america and in the southern parts of europe with regard to north america cuvier says the elephas primigenius has left thousands of its carcasses from spain to the shores of siberia and it has been found in the whole of north america the fossil ox in a like manner he writes is buried dans toute la partie boréale des deux continens puisque on en a dallemagne ditalie de prussie de la sibérie occidentale et orientale et de lamérique i may here add that horses bones mingled with those of the mastodon have several times been transmitted for sale from north america to england but it has always been imagined from the simple fact of their being horses bones that they had been accidentally mingled with the fossils among the remains brought home by captain beechey from the west coast of the same continent in the frozen region of north dr buckland has described the astragalus metacarpus and metatarsus of the horse which were associated with the remains of the elephas primigenius and of the fossil ox thus we have an elephant an ox and a horse the species of the latter is only presumed to be identical common to europe and to north america very few species of living quadrupeds which are altogether terrestrial in their habits are common to the two continents and these few are chiefly confined to the extreme frozen regions of the north the separation therefore of the asiatic and american zoological provinces appears formerly to have been less perfect than at present the remains of the elephant and of the ox have been found on the banks of the anadir long e on the extreme part of siberia nearest the american coast and the former remains according to chamisso are common in the peninsula of kamtschatka on the opposite shores likewise of the narrow strait which divides these two great continents we know from the discoveries of kotzebue and beechey that the remains of both animals occur abundantly and as dr buckland has shown they are associated with the bones of the horse the teeth of which animal in europe according to cuvier accompany by thousands the remains of the pachydermata of the later periods with these facts we may safely look at this quarter as the line of communication now interrupted by the steady progress of geological change by which the elephant the ox and the horse entered america and peopled its wide extent the occurrence of the fossil horse and of mastodon angustidens in south america is a much more remarkable circumstance than that of the animals mentioned above in the northern half of the continent for if we divide america not by the isthmus of panama but by the southern part of mexico in lat where the great tableland presents an obstacle to the migration of species by affecting the climate and by forming with the exception of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast a broad barrier we shall then have two zoological provinces strongly contrasted with each other some few species alone have passed the barrier and may be considered as wanderers such as the puma opossum kinkajou and peccari the mammalogy of south america is characterized by possessing several species of the genera of llama cavy and the allied animals tapir peccari opossum anteater sloth and armadillo if north america had possessed species of these genera proper to it the distinction of the two provinces could not have been drawn but the presence of a few wanderers scarcely affects the case north america on the other hand is characterized by its numerous rodents and by four genera of solid horned ruminants of which section the southern half does not possess a single species whether from west to east or the reverse perhaps when we recollect how extraordinarily the pachydermata abounded during the tertiary epochs in the old world and that the representatives of these animals now only exist in that quarter it may seem most probable that the migration took place from asia to america this distinction of the two zoological provinces does not appear always to have existed at the present day the order of edentata is much more strongly developed in south america than in any other part of the world and concluding from the fossil remains which were discovered at bahia blanca such must have been the case during a former epoch in america north of mexico not one of this order is now found yet as is well known the gigantic megalonyx considered by cuvier as a species of megatherium has been found only in that country and as it appears from recent observations the megatherium cuvierii itself likewise occurs there mr owen showed me the tibia of some large animal which sir philip egerton had purchased out of a collection of the remains of the mastodon brought from north america mr owen says it certainly belongs to one of the edentata and it so closely resembles a bone which i found embedded together with fragments of the great armadillolike covering in banda oriental that it probably forms a species of the same genus lastly among the fossils brought home by captain beechey from the nw coast there was a cervical vertebra which when compared by mr pentland with the skeletons at paris was found to resemble that of the sloth and anteater more than that of any other animal although having some points of essential difference of the pachydermata four or five species are now found in america but as in the case of the edentata none are peculiar to the continent north of mexico and one alone seems to exist there as a wanderer yet the account of the multitude of bones of the mastodon and elephant which have been discovered in the saltlicks of north america is familiar to every one the remains of the mastodon giganteum have been found nowhere else but those of the elephas primigenius are common to a large part of the terrestrial globe this elephant must have existed in mexico and cuvier judging from a fragment of a tusk thinks it even extended to the neighbourhood of quito in south america in the latter country three species of mastodon have been discovered one of these m angustidens is common to europe it is singular that its remains as yet have never been brought from north america nevertheless considering that it was a contemporary of the extinct animals above mentioned it seems highly probable that it arrived by the same line of communication on the nw coast as its remains have frequently been found at a great elevation in the cordillera perhaps its habits led it to follow that chain of mountains from north to south after these facts it is only in conformity with what we might almost have expected that the horse belonging to the same order of pachydermata should formerly have inhabited both north and south america it is interesting thus to discover an epoch anterior to the division as far at least as two important orders among the mammalia are concerned of the continent into two separate zoological provinces the geologist who believes in considerable oscillations of level in the crust of the globe within recent periods will not fear to speculate either on the elevation of the mexican platform as a cause of the distinction or on the submergence of land in the west indian seasa circumstance which is perhaps indicated by the zoology of those islands the number of bones embedded in the grand estuary deposit of the pampas must he very great i myself heard of and saw many groups the names of such places as the stream of the animal the hill of the giant tell the same story at other times i heard of the marvellous property of certain rivers which had the power of changing small bones into large or as some maintained the bones themselves grew as far as i am aware not one of these animals as was formerly supposed perished in the marshes or muddy riverbeds of the present land but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the deposit in which their remains were formerly buried we may therefore conclude that the whole area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre for these extinct quadrupeds while travelling through the country i received several vivid descriptions of the effect of a great drought and the account of this may throw some light on the cases where vast numbers of animals of all kinds have been embedded together the period included between the years and is called the gran seco or the great drought during this time so little rain fell that the vegetation even to the thistles failed the brooks were dried up and the whole country assumed the appearance of a dusty highroad this was especially the case in the northern part of the province of buenos ayres and the southern part of st fe very great numbers of birds wild animals cattle and horses perished from the want of food and water a man told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well which he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water and that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued the lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of buenos ayres alone was taken at one million head a proprietor at san pedro had previously to these years cattle at the end not one remained san pedro is situated in the middle of the finest country and even now again abounds with animals yet during the latter part of the gran seco live cattle were brought in vessels for the consumption of the inhabitants the animals roamed from their estancias and wandering far to the southward were mingled together in such multitudes that a government commission was sent from buenos ayres to settle the disputes of the owners sir woodbine parish informed me of another and very curious source of dispute the ground being so long dry such quantities of dust were blown about that in this open country the landmarks became obliterated and people could not tell the limits of their estates i was informed by an eyewitness that the cattle in herds of thousands rushed into the parana and being exhausted by hunger they were unable to crawl up the muddy banks and thus were drowned the arm which runs by san pedro was so full of putrid carcasses that the master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impossible to pass that way without doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the river their bodies when putrid floated down the stream and many in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the plata all the small rivers became highly saline and this caused the death of vast numbers in particular spots for when an animal drinks of such water it does not recover i noticed but probably it was the effect of a gradual increase rather than of any one period that the smaller streams in the pampas were paved with a breccia of bones subsequently to this unusual drought a very rainy season commenced which caused great floods hence it is almost certain that some thousands of these skeletons were buried by the deposits of the very next year what would be the opinion of a geologist viewing such an enormous collection of bones of all kinds of animals and of all ages thus embedded in one thick earthy mass would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of the land rather than to the common order of things these droughts to a certain degree seem to be periodical i was told the dates of several others and the intervals were about fifteen years a tendency to periodical droughts is i believe common in most dry climates such certainly is the case in australia captain sturt says they return after every ten and twelve years and are then followed by excessive rains which gradually become less and less till another drought is the consequence the year and the two following were singularly dry in australia and the latter were the first of the gran seco i mention this because general beatson in his account of the island of st helena has remarked that variations in climate sometimes appear to be the effect of the operation of some very general cause he says page the severe drought felt here in and was far more calamitous in india doctor anderson states in a letter to colonel kyd dated the th of august that owing to a failure of rain during the above two years one half of the inhabitants in the northern provinces had perished by famine and the remainder were so feeble and weak that on the report of rice coming from the malabar coast poor people left rajamundy and very few of them reached the seaside although the distance is only miles it appears by mr bryan edwardss history of the west indies that the seasons were unusually dry at the island of montserrat barrow in the latter part of when at the cape de verd islands says in fact a drought of three years continuance and consequent famine for almost the same period had nearly desolated the island october thi had intended to have pushed my excursion further but not being quite well i was compelled to return by a balandra or onemasted vessel of about a hundred tons burden which was bound to buenos ayres as the weather was not fair we moored early in the day to a branch of a tree on one of the islands the parana is full of islands which undergo a constant round of decay and renovation in the memory of the master several large ones had disappeared and others again had been formed and protected by vegetation they are composed of muddy sand without even the smallest pebble and were then about four feet above the level of the river but during the periodical floods they are inundated they all present one character numerous willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of creeping plants thus forming a thick jungle these thickets afford a retreat for carpinchos and jaguars the fear of the latter animal quite destroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods this evening i had not proceeded a hundred yards before finding indubitable signs of the recent presence of the tiger i was obliged to come back on every island there are tracks and as on the former excursion el rastro de los indios had been the subject of conversation so in this was el rastro del tigre the wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be the favourite haunt of the jaguar but south of the plata i was told they frequented the reeds bordering lakes wherever they are they seem to require water the jaguar has been killed on the banks of the rio negro in lat and falconer states that the lake nahuelhuapi takes its name from the indian word for tiger the latitude of this lake is about which corresponds to the situation of the pyrenees in the northern hemisphere these animals are particularly abundant on the isles of the parana their common prey is the carpincho so that it is generally said where the carpinchos are plentiful there is little danger of the jaguar falconer states that near the mouth of the plata on the southern side the jaguars are numerous and that they chiefly live on fish this account i have heard repeated on the parana they have killed many woodcutters and have even entered vessels at night there is a man now living in the bajada who coming up from below when it was dark was seized on the deck he escaped however with the loss of the use of one arm when the floods drive these animals from the islands they are most dangerous i was told that a few years since a very large one found its way into a church at st fe two padres entering one after the other were killed and a third who came to see what was the matter escaped with difficulty the beast was destroyed by being shot from a corner of the building which was unroofed they commit also at these times great ravages among the cattle and horses it is said they kill their prey by breaking the vertebræ of the neck if driven from the carcass they seldom return to it the gauchos say that the jaguar when wandering about at night is much tormented by the foxes yelping as they follow him this is a curious coincidence with the fact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying in a similarly officious manner the east indian tiger the jaguar is a noisy animal roaring much by night and especially before bad weather one day when hunting on the banks of the uruguay i was shown certain trees to which these animals are said constantly to recur for the purpose of sharpening their claws i saw three wellknown trees in front the bark was worn smooth and on each side there were deep scratches or rather grooves extending in an oblique line nearly a yard in length the scars were of different ages a common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the neighbourhood is to examine these trees i imagine this habit of the jaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the common cat as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it scrapes the leg of a chair some such habit must be also common to the puma for on the bare hard soil of patagonia i have frequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made them the object of this practice is i should think to blunt rather than to sharpen as the gauchos say the points of their claws which are so seldom used the jaguar is killed without much difficulty by the aid of dogs baying and driving him up a tree where he is despatched with bullets owing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings our only amusement was catching fish for our dinner there were several kinds and all good eating a fish called the armado a silurus is remarkable from a harsh grating noise it makes when caught by hook and line and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is beneath the water this same fish has the power of firmly catching hold of any object such as the blade of an oar or the fishingline with the strong spine both of its pectoral and dorsal fin in the evening the weather was quite tropical the thermometer standing at numbers of fireflies were hovering about and the musquitoes were very troublesome i exposed my hand for five minutes and it was soon black with them i do not suppose there could have been less than fifty all busy sucking october thwe got under way and passed punta gorda where there is a colony of tame indians from the province of missiones we sailed rapidly down the current but before sunset from a silly fear of bad weather we brought to in a narrow arm of the river i took the boat and rowed some distance up this creek it was very narrow winding and deep on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high formed by trees intwined with creepers gave to the canal a singularly gloomy appearance i here saw a very extraordinary bird called the scissorbeak rhyncops nigra it has short legs web feet extremely longpointed wings and is of about the size of a tern the beak is flattened laterally that is in a plane at right angles to that of a spoonbill or duck it is as flat and elastic as an ivory papercutter and the lower mandible differently from every other bird is an inch and a half longer than the upper i will here detail all i know of the habits of the scissorbeak it is found both on the east and west coasts between lat and and frequents either salt or fresh water the specimen now at the zoological society was shot at a lake near maldonado from which the water had been nearly drained and which in consequence swarmed with small fry i there saw several of these birds generally in small flocks flying backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake they kept their bills wide open and with the lower mandible half buried in the water thus skimming the surface they ploughed it in their course the water was quite smooth and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirrorlike surface in their flight they frequently twist about with extreme rapidity and so dexterously manage that with their projecting lower mandible they plough up small fish which are secured by the upper half of their scissorlike bills this fact i repeatedly saw as like swallows they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before me occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild irregular and rapid they then also uttered loud harsh cries when these birds are fishing the length of the primary feathers of the wings is seen to be quite necessary in order to keep the latter dry when thus employed their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds the tail is much used in steering their irregular course these birds are common far inland along the course of the rio parana it is said they remain during the whole year and breed in the marshes during the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains at some distance from the water being at anchor as i have said in one of the deep creeks between the islands of the parana as the evening drew to a close one of these scissorbeaks suddenly appeared the water was quite still and many little fish were rising the bird continued for a long time to skim the surface flying in its wild and irregular manner up and down the narrow canal now dark with the growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees at monte video i observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the mudbanks at the head of the harbour in the same manner as on the grassy plains near the parana and every evening they took flight direct to seaward from these facts i suspect that the rhyncops generally fishes by night at which time many of the lower animals come most abundantly to the surface m lesson states that he has seen these birds opening the shells of the mactræ buried in the sandbanks on the coast of chile from their weak bills with the lower mandible so much produced their short legs and long wings it is very improbable that this can be a general habit in our course down the parana i only observed three other birds whose habits are worth mentioning one is a small kingfisher alcedo americana it has a longer tail than the european species and hence does not sit in so stiff and upright a position its flight also instead of being direct and rapid like the course of an arrow is weak and undulatory as among the softbilled birds it utters a low note like the clicking together of two small stones a small green parrot with a gray breast appears to prefer the tall trees on the islands to any other situation for its buildingplace a number of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of sticks these parrots always live in flocks and commit great ravages on the cornfields i was told that near colonia were killed in the course of one year a bird milvulus forficatus with a forked tail terminated by two long feathers and named by the spaniards scissortail is very common near buenos ayres it commonly sits on a branch of the ombu tree near the house and thence takes a short flight in pursuit of insects and returns to the same spot when on the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a caricaturelikeness of the common swallow it has the power in the air of turning very shortly and in so doing opens and shuts its tail sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical direction just like a pair of scissors in structure this bird is a true tyrantflycatcher although in its habits certainly allied to the swallows october thsome leagues above rozario the western shore was bounded by perpendicular cliffs which extended in a long line to below san nicholas hence the coast more resembled that of the sea than that of a freshwater river it is a great drawback to the scenery of the parana that from the soft nature of its banks the water is very muddy the uruguay flowing through a granitic country is much clearer and i am told that where the two channels unite at the head of the plata the waters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red colours in the evening the wind not being quite fair as usual we immediately moored and the next day as it blew rather freshlv though with a favouring current the master was much too indolent to think of starting at bajada he was described to me as hombre muy aflictoa man always miserable to get on but certainly he bore all delays with admirable resignation he was an old spaniard and had been many years in this country he professed a great liking to the english but stoutly maintained that the battle of trafalgar was merely won by the spanish captains having been all bought over and that the only really gallant action on either side was performed by the spanish admiral it struck me as rather characteristic that this man should prefer his countrymen being thought the worst of traitors rather than unskilful or cowardly th and thwe continued slowly to sail down the noble stream the current helped us but little azara has estimated that even near the sources between latitudes and the river has only a fall of one foot for each mile of latitude lower down this must be much diminished it is stated that a rise of seven feet at buenos ayres can be perceived sixty leagues up the course of the parana we met during our descent very few vessels one of the best gifts of nature seems here wilfully thrown away in so grand a channel of communication being left unoccupied a river in which ships might navigate from a temperate country as surprisingly abundant in certain productions as destitute of others to another possessing a tropical climate and a soil which according to the best of judges m bonpland is perhaps unequalled in fertility in any part of the world how different would have been the aspect of this river if english colonists had by good fortune first sailed up the plata what noble towns would now have occupied its shores till the death of francia the dictator of paraguay these two countries must remain distinct as if placed on opposite sides of the globe and when the old bloodyminded tyrant is gone to his long account paraguay will be torn by revolutions violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm that country will have to learn like every other south american state that a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men imbued with the principles of justice and honour october thbeing arrived at the mouth of the parana and as i was very anxious to reach buenos ayres i went on shore at las conchas with the intention of riding there upon landing i found to my great surprise that i was to a certain degree a prisoner a violent revolution having broken out all the ports were laid under an embargo i could not return to my vessel and as for going by land to the city it was out of the question after a long conversation with the commandant i obtained permission to go the next day to general rolor who commanded a division of the rebels on this side of the capital in the morning i rode to the encampment the general officers and soldiers all appeared and i believe really were great villains the general the very evening before he left the city voluntarily went to the governor and with his hand to his heart pledged his word of honour that he would remain faithful to the last the general told me that the city was in a state of close blockade and that all he could do was to give me a passport to the commanderinchief of the rebels at quilmes we had therefore to take a great sweep round the city and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses my reception at the encampment was quite civil but i was told it was impossible that i could be allowed to enter the city i was very anxious about this as i anticipated the beagles departure from the rio plata earlier than it took place having mentioned however general rosass obliging kindness to me when at the colorado magic itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this conversation i was instantly told that though they could not give me a passport if i chose to leave my guide and horses i might pass their sentinels i was too glad to accept of this and an officer was sent with me to give directions that i might not be stopped at the bridge the road for the space of a league was quite deserted i met one party of soldiers who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport and at length i was not a little pleased to find myself within the city this revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances but in a state which in the course of nine months from february to october underwent fifteen changes in its governmenteach governor according to the constitution being elected for three yearsit would be the height of illiberality to ask for pretexts in this case a party of men who being attached to rosas were disgusted with the governor balcarce to the number of seventy left the city and with the cry of rosas the whole country took arms the city was then blockaded no provisions cattle or horses were allowed to enter besides this there was only a little skirmishing and a few men daily killed the outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of meat they would certainly be victorious general rosas could not have known of this rising but it appears to me quite consonant with the plans of his party a year ago he was elected governor but he refused it without the sala would also confer on him extraordinary powers this was refused and since then his party have shown that no other governor can keep his place the warfare on both sides was avowedly protracted till it was possible to hear from rosas a note arrived a few days after i left buenos ayres which stated that the general disapproved of peace having been broken but that he thought the outside party had justice on their side on the bare reception of this the governor ministers and part of the military to the number of some hundreds fled from the city the rebels entered elected a new governor and were paid for their services to the number of men from these proceedings it was clear that rosas ultimately would become the dictator to the term king the people in this as in other republics have a particular dislike since leaving south america we have heard that rosas has been elected with powers and for a time altogether opposed to the constitutional principles of the republic chapter viii monte video excursion to colonia del sacramiento horse swimming value of an estancia cattle how counted geology great thistlebeds rio negro perforated pebbles shepherd dogs horses broken in gauchos riding feats with lazo toxodon armadillolike gigantic covering great tail return to monte video character of inhabitants banda oriental having been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city i was glad to escape on board a packet bound for monte video a town in a state of blockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence in this case moreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within the sentinels were the worst of all for from their office and from having arms in their hands they robbed with a degree of authority which other men could not imitate our passage was a very long and tedious one the plata looks like a noble estuary on the map but it is in truth a poor affair a wide expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty at one time of the day the two shores both of which are extremely low could just be distinguished from the deck on arriving at monte video i found the beagle would not sail for some time so i prepared for a short excursion in this part of banda oriental every thing which i said about the country near maldonado is applicable to this the land however with the one exception of the green mount feet high from which it takes its name is far more level very little of the undulating grassy plain is enclosed but near the town there are a few hedge banks covered with agaves cacti and fennel november thwe left monte video in the afternoon i intended to proceed to colonia del sacramiento situated on the northern bank of the plata and opposite to buenos ayres and thence following up the uruguay to the village of mercedes on the rio negro one of the many rivers of this name in south america and from this point to return direct to monte video we slept at the house of my guide at canelones in the morning we rose early in the hopes of being able to ride a good distance but it was a vain attempt for all the rivers were flooded we passed in boats the streams of canelones st lucia and san josè and thus lost much time on a former excursion i crossed the lucia near its mouth and i was surprised to observe how easily our horses although not used to swim passed over a width of at least six hundred yards on mentioning this at monte video i was told that a vessel containing some mountebanks and their horses being wrecked in the plata one horse swam seven miles to the shore in the course of the day i was amused by the dexterity with which a gaucho forced a restive horse to swim a river he stripped off his clothes and jumping on its back rode into the water till it was out of its depth then slipping off over the crupper he caught hold of the tail and as often as the horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its face as soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side the man pulled himself on and was firmly seated bridle in hand before the horse gained the bank a naked man on a naked horse is a fine spectacle i had no idea how well the two animals suited each other the tail of a horse is a very useful appendage i have passed a river in a boat with four people in it which was ferried across in the same way as the gaucho if a man and horse have to cross a broad river the best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pummel or mane and help himself with the other arm we slept and staid the following day at the post of cufre in the evening the postman or lettercarrier arrived he was a day after his time owing to the rio rozario being flooded it would not however be of much consequence for although he had passed through some of the principal towns in banda oriental his luggage consisted of two letters the view from the house was pleasing an undulating green surface with distant glimpses of the plata i find i look at this province with very different eyes from what i did upon my first arrival i recollect i then thought it singularly level but now after galloping over the pampas my only surprise is what could have induced me ever to have called it level the country is a series of undulations in themselves perhaps not absolutely great but as compared to the plains of st fe real mountains from these inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets and the turf is green and luxuriant november thwe crossed the rozario which was deep and rapid and passing the village of colla arrived at midday at colonia del sacramiento the distance is twenty leagues through a country covered with fine grass but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants i was invited to sleep at colonia and to accompany on the following day a gentleman to his estancia where there were some limestone rocks the town is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at monte video it is strongly fortified but both fortifications and town suffered much from the brazilian war it is very ancient and the irregularity of the streets and the surrounding groves of old orange and peach trees gave it a pretty appearance the church is a curious ruin it was used as a powdermagazine and was struck by lightning in one of the ten thousand thunderstorms of the rio plata twothirds of the building were blown away to the very foundation and the rest stands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of lightning and gunpowder in the evening i wandered about the halfdemolished walls of the town it was the chief seat of the brazilian wara war most injurious to this country not so much in its immediate effects as in being the origin of a multitude of generals and all other grades of officers more generals are numbered but not paid in the united provinces of la plata than in the united kingdom of great britain these gentlemen have learned to like power and do not object to a little skirmishing hence there are many always on the watch to create disturbance and to overturn a government which as yet has never rested on any stable foundation i noticed however both here and in other places a very general interest in the ensuing election for the president and this appears a good sign for the prosperity of this little country the inhabitants do not require much education in their representatives i heard some men discussing the merits of those for colonia and it was said that although they were not men of business they could all sign their names with this every reasonable man was satisfied th rode with my host to his estancia at the arroyo de san juan in the evening we took a ride round the estate it contained two square leagues and a half and was situated in what is called a rincon that is one side was fronted by the plata and the two others guarded by impassable brooks there was an excellent port for little vessels and an abundance of small wood which is valuable as supplying fuel to buenos ayres i was curious to know the value of so complete an estancia of cattle there were and it would well support three or four times that number of mares together with broken horses and sheep there was plenty of water and limestone a rough house excellent corrals and a peach orchard for all this he had been offered l and only wanted l additional and probably would sell it for less the chief trouble with an estancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot in order to make them tame and to count them this latter operation would be thought difficult where there are ten or fifteen thousand head together it is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably divide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred each troop is recognised by a few peculiarly marked animals and its number is known so that one being lost out of ten thousand it is perceived by its absence from one of the tropillas during a stormy night the cattle all mingle together but the next morning the tropillas separate as before november thpassing the village of las vacas we slept at a house of a north american who worked a limekiln on the arroyo de las vivoras in the morning we rode to a projecting headland on the banks of the river called punta gorda on the way we tried to find a jaguar there were plenty of fresh tracks and we visited the trees on which they are said to sharpen their claws but we did not succeed in disturbing one from this point the rio uruguay presented to our view a noble volume of water from the clearness and rapidity of the stream its appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the parana on the opposite coast several branches from the latter river entered the uruguay as the sun was shining the two colours of the waters could be seen quite distinct the geological section presented by the cliffs was interesting at st fe a stratum with marine remains was seen gradually passing into an estuary deposit here we have an alternation of actiona circumstance no ways improbable in a great bay a formation of red earthy clay with nodules of marl and in every respect identical with that of the pampas is covered by a white limestone containing large extinct oysters and other marine shells and over this again is placed the reddish earthy matter as in the rest of banda oriental in the evening we proceeded on our road towards mercedes on the rio negro at night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which we happened to arrive it was a very large estate being ten leagues square and the owner is one of the greatest landowners in the country his nephew had charge of it and with him there was a captain in the army who the other day ran away from buenos ayres considering their station their conversation was rather amusing they expressed as was usual unbounded astonishment at the globe being round and could scarcely credit that a hole would if deep enough come out on the other side they had however heard of a country where there were six months light and six of darkness and where the inhabitants were very tall and thin they were curious about the price and condition of horses and cattle in england upon finding out we did not catch our animals with the lazo they cried out ah then you use nothing but the bolas the idea of an enclosed country was quite novel to them the captain at last said he had one question to ask me which he should be very much obliged if i would answer with all truth i trembled to think how deeply scientific it would be it was whether the ladies of buenos ayres were not the handsomest in the world i replied charmingly so he added i have one other question do ladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs i solemnly assured him they did not they were absolutely delighted the captain exclaimed look there a man who has seen half the world says it is the case we always thought so but now we know it my excellent judgment in beauty procured me a most hospitable reception the captain forced me to take his bed and he would sleep on his recado ststarted at sunrise and rode slowly during the whole day the geological nature of this part of the province was different from the rest and closely resembled that of the pampas in consequence there were immense beds of the thistle as well as of the cardoon the whole country indeed may be called one great bed the two sorts grow separate each plant in company with its own kind the cardoon is as high as a horses back but the pampas thistle is often higher than the crown of the riders head to leave the road for a yard is out of the question and the road itself is partly and in some cases entirely closed pasture of course there is none if cattle or horses once enter the bed they are for the time completely lost hence it is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the year for when jaded enough to face the thistles they rush among them and are seen no more in these districts there are very few estancias and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys where fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist as night came on before we arrived at our journeys end we slept at a miserable little hovel inhabited by the poorest people the extreme though rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess considering their grade of life was quite delightful november darrived at an estancia on the berquelo belonging to a very hospitable englishman to whom i had a letter of introduction from my friend mr lumb i staid here three days one morning i rode with my host to the sierra del pedro flaco about twenty miles up the rio negro nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse grass which was as high as a horses belly yet there were square leagues without a single head of cattle the province of banda oriental if well stocked would support an astonishing number of animals at present the annual export of hides from monte video amounts to three hundred thousand and the home consumption from waste is very considerable the view of the rio negro from the sierra was the most picturesque which i any where saw the river broad deep and rapid wound at the foot of a rocky precipitous cliff a belt of wood followed its course and the horizon was terminated by the distant undulations of the plain of turf when in this neighbourhood i several times heard of the sierra de las cuentas a hill distant many miles to the northward the name signifies hill of beads i was assured that vast numbers of little round stones of various colours each with a small cylindrical hole are found there formerly the indians used to collect them for the purpose of making necklaces and bracelets a taste i may observe which is common to all savage nations as well as to the most polished i did not know what to understand from this story but upon mentioning it at the cape of good hope to dr andrew smith he told me that he recollected finding on the southeastern coast of africa about one hundred miles to the eastward of st johns river some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from attrition and mixed with gravel on the seabeach each crystal was about five lines in diameter and from an inch to an inch and a half in length many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to the other perfectly cylindrical and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine catgut their colour was red or dull white the natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals i have mentioned these circumstances because although no crystallized body is at present known to assume this form it may lead some future traveller to investigate the real nature of such stones while staying at this estancia i was amused with what i saw and heard of the shepherd dogs of the country when riding it is a common thing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs at the distance of some miles from any house or man i often wondered how so firm a friendship had been established the method of education consists in separating the puppy while very young from the bitch and in accustoming it to its future companions an ewe is held three or four times a day for the little thing to suck and a nest of wool is made for it in the sheeppen at no time is it allowed to associate with other dogs or with the children of the family the puppy is moreover generally castrated so that when grown up it can scarcely have any feelings in common with the rest of its kind from this education it has no wish to leave the flock and just as another dog will defend its master man so will these the sheep it is amusing to observe when approaching a flock how the dog immediately advances barking and the sheep all close in his rear as if round the oldest ram these dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a certain hour in the evening their most troublesome fault when young is their desire of playing with the sheep for in their sport they sometimes gallop their poor subjects most unmercifully the shepherd dog comes to the house every day for some meat and immediately it is given him he skulks away as if ashamed of himself on these occasions the housedogs are very tyrannical and the least of them will attack and pursue the stranger the minute however the latter has reached the flock he turns round and begins to bark and then all the housedogs take very quickly to their heels in a similar manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs will scarcely ever and i was told by some never venture to attack a flock guarded even by one of these faithful shepherds the whole account appears to me a curious instance of the pliability of the affections in the dog race and yet whether wild or however educated with a mutual feeling of respect or fear for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association for we can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the single one with its flock except that they consider from some confused notion that the one thus associated gains power as if in company with its own kind f cuvier has observed that all animals that readily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their society and thus fulfil their instinct of association in the above case the shepherd dogs rank the sheep as their fellow brethren and the wild dogs though knowing that the individual sheep are not dogs but are good to eat yet partly consent to this view when seeing them in a flock with a shepherd dog at their head one evening a domidor a subduer of horses came for the purpose of breaking in some colts i will describe the preparatory steps for i believe they have not been mentioned by other travellers a troop of wild young horses is driven into the corral or large enclosure of stakes and the door is shut we will suppose that one man alone has to catch and mount a horse which as yet had never felt bridle or saddle i conceive except by a gaucho such a feat would be utterly impracticable the gaucho picks out a fullgrown colt and as the beast rushes round the circus he throws his lazo so as to catch both the front legs instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock and whilst struggling on the ground the gaucho holding the lazo tight makes a circle so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the fetlock and draws it close to the two front he then hitches the lazo so that the three legs are bound together then sitting on the horses neck he fixes a strong bridle without a bit to the lower jaw this he does by passing a narrow thong through the eyeholes at the end of the reins and several times round both jaw and tongue the two front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern thong fastened by a slipknot the lazo which bound the three together being then loosed the horse rises with difficulty the gaucho now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw leads the horse outside the corral if a second man is present otherwise the trouble is much greater he holds the animals head
