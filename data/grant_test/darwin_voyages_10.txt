for the weight of the body forced a passage and all the slips and falls were in the right direction captain king has given a sketch of the geology of tierra del fuego to which i have little to add a great formation of clayslate rarely containing organic remains but sometimes presenting casts of a kind of ammonite is fronted on the east side by plains belonging probably to two tertiary epochs on the west coast a prolongation of the grand crevice of the andes from which so much heat has escaped from the interior of the globe has metamorphosed the slate there is however a double line the structure of which i do not quite comprehend the interior one consists of granite and mica slate the exterior one perhaps more modern of greenstone porphyritic and other curious trappean rocks almost every one at first thinks that this country owes its grand name of the land of fire to the number of its volcanoes such however is not the case i did not see even a pebble of any volcanic rock except in wollaston island where some rounded masses of scori√¶ were embedded in a conglomerate of no modern date in a geological point of view this circumstance allows us to consider the grand linear train of ancient and modern volcanoes which fall on parallel fissures in the andes as extending from lat south to north a distance little less than seven thousand geographical miles perhaps the most curious feature in the geology of this country is the extent to which the land is intersected by arms of the sea these channels as captain king remarks are irregular and dotted with islands where the granitic and trappean rocks occur but in the clayslate formation are so straight that in one instance a parallel ruler placed on the map upon the projecting points of the south shore extended across also touched the headlands of the opposite coast i have heard captain fitzroy remark that on entering any of these channels from the outer coast it is always necessary to look out directly for anchorage for further inland the depth soon becomes extremely great captain cook in entering christmas sound had first fathom then and immediately afterwards no soundings with this structure of the bottom i presume must arise from the sediment deposited near the mouths of the channels by the opposed tides and swell and likewise from the enormous degradation of the coast rocks caused by an ocean harassed by endless gales the strait of magellan is extremely deep in most parts even close to the shore about midchannel eastward of cape froward captain king found no bottom with feet if therefore the water should be drained off tierra del fuego would present a far more lofty range of mountains than it does at present i will not here enter on any speculations regarding the causes which have produced this remarkable structure in a district in which the latter movements at least have been those of elevation i may however observe that pebbles and great boulders of various and peculiar crystalline rocks which have undoubtedly travelled from the southwest coast lie scattered over the whole of the eastern part of tierra del fuego one enormous block of syenite near st sebastian bay was barnshaped and had a girth of feet it projected five feet above the sand and appeared to be deeply buried the very nearest point to which we can look for the parent rock is about ninety miles distant on the shores of the strait of magellan near port famine numerous semirounded fragments of various granites and hornblendic rocks are strewed on the beach and on the sides of the mountain to an elevation of thirty or forty feet now to this point the high road from the southern and western shores passes directly over the great abyss of more than feet deep whatever may have been the means of transport it has not been one of indiscriminate violence for the two places st sebastian bay and shoal harbour where the great fragments are most numerous certainly existed previously to the last and smallest change of level as channels connecting the strait of magellan in the one case with the open sea and in the other with otway water the climate of the southern part of south america presents many phenomena of the highest interest it has long been observed that there exists some essential difference between it and that of the countries in the northern hemisphere i have already remarked on the surprising contrast between the rank vegetation of the broken west coast consequent on the humid climate as compared with the dry and sterile plains of patagonia the clouded and boisterous state of the atmosphere is necessarily accompanied by a decrease in extreme temperature hence we find that fruits which ripen well and are very abundant such as the grape and fig in lat on the east coast succeed very poorly in a lower latitude on the opposite side of the continent the result is more strongly marked if we take europe as the standard of comparison in chiloe lat corresponding to the northern parts of spain peaches require the greatest care and seldom produce fruit but strawberries and apples succeed to admiration at valdivia lat or that of madrid standard peaches bear abundantly grapes and figs ripen but are far from common olives seldom even partially ripen and oranges not at all yet in europe this is the parallel most productive of these fruits even at concepcion lat oranges are not abundant though the other named fruits succeed perfectly at the falklands in the same latitude as the south of england wheat very seldom comes to maturity but we ought to feel little surprise at this when we hear that in chiloe lat the inhabitants are frequently compelled to cut their corn before it is ready and bring it into their houses to dry with respect to the climate of tierra del fuego during the colder parts of the year captain king has published some most interesting tables in the geographical journal the beagle during this voyage was employed in the extreme southern parts of the country from december th to february th from the appearance of the vegetation during the first part and from the weather we experienced at the falkland islands subsequent to the last date i feel little doubt that these sixtyfive days included the best part of the summer perhaps if another fortnight had been added the mean would have been a little higher the first eighteen of these days were spent partly at sea near cape horn and we were drifted for a short time by bad weather to nearly ninety miles to the southward the mean temperature from observations made every two hours by the officers on board the beagle was during the succeeding thirtyseven days the beagle was at anchor in different harbours a few leagues north of cape horn and then the mean from observations at am noon and pm was the mean therefore between these two periods which include the hottest part of the year is only the latter of the two periods was unusually warm but the former much the contrary and the station where the observations were made was a little further to the southward the whole of these observations apply to the extreme islands captain kings were made in a central position further northward if from the above considerations we add two degrees and a half to the mean obtained this voyage the result will probably give the temperature of the hottest part of the year in central tierra del fuego captain king gives as the mean temperature of june of july of the first twelve days in august answering to our december january and february which three months appear to be the coldest and the mean of these is dublin is nearly in the same latitude in the northern hemisphere as port famine is in the southern and we will take its temperature as a means of comparison latitudes summer temperature winter temperature difference mean of summer and winter dublin n o port famine s difference it will be seen by this that the temperature at port famine is very considerably lower both during summer and winter than at dublin and that at the former the difference between the seasons is not so great or that the climate is there more equable it seems the general opinion of those who have visited this country that the frosts are not so severe or so long as in england the sealers say that throughout the year they wear the same quantity of clothing nevertheless captain king states that during the winter of the temperature was once as low as i have drawn up these rough and approximate statements merely for the sake of illustrating some of the following remarks the kind of climate here described appears to be common to the southern parts of the whole of the southern hemisphere although so inhospitable to our feelings and to most of the plants from the warmer parts of europe yet it is most favourable to the native vegetation the forests which cover the entire country between the latitudes of and rival in luxuriance those of the glowing intertropical regions whilst in chiloe lat i could almost have fancied myself in brazil stately trees of many kinds with smooth and highly coloured barks are loaded by parasitical plants of the monocotyledonous structure large and elegant ferns are numerous and arborescent grasses intwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or forty feet above the ground palmtrees grow in lat an arborescent grass very like a bamboo in and another closelyallied kind of great length but not erect even as far south as in another part of this same hemisphere which has so uniform a character owing to its large proportional area of sea forster found parasitical orchideous plants living south of lat in new zealand treeferns thrive luxuriantly near hobart town in van diemens land i measured one there which was exactly six feet in circumference and its height from the ground to the base of the fronds appeared to be very little under twenty mr brown says an arborescent species of the same genus dicksonia was found by forster in new zealand at dusky bay in nearly s the highest latitude in which treeferns have yet been observed it is remarkable that although they have so considerable a range in the southern hemisphere no treefern has been found beyond the northern tropic a distribution in the two hemispheres somewhat similar to this has been already noticed respecting the orchide√¶ that are parasitical on trees even in tierra del fuego captain king describes the vegetation thriving most luxuriantly and large woody stemmed trees of fuchsia and veronica in england considered and treated as tender plants in full flower within a very short distance of the base of a mountain covered for twothirds down with snow and with the temperature at he states also that hummingbirds were seen sipping the sweets of the flowers after two or three days of constant rain snow and sleet during which time the thermometer had been at the freezing point i myself have seen parrots feeding on the seeds of the winters bark south of latitude although the limit of an almost tropical vegetation extends thus far southward yet the dearth of living things both vegetable and animal on the islands situated even far without the antarctic circle is surprising compared with the corresponding parallels in the northern hemisphere in south shetland in lat to same as ferroe or southern part of norway weddell states none of the islands afford any vegetation save a short straggling grass which is found in very small patches in places where there happens to be a little soil this together with a moss similar to that which is found in iceland appears in the middle of january at which time the islands are partially clear of snow in deception island one of the same group lieutenant kendall says there was nothing in the shape of vegetation except a small kind of lichen the island itself is partly composed of ice and volcanic ashes interstratified another curious proof of the rigour of the climate is mentioned having observed a mound on the hill immediately above this cove i opened it and found a rude coffin the rotten state of which bespoke its having been long consigned to the earth but the body had undergone scarcely any decomposition the legs were doubled up and it was dressed in the jacket and cap of a sailor but neither they nor the countenance were similar to those of an englishman sandwich land which is nearly three degrees further from the pole is thus described by captain cook february st hottest time in the year and in same latitude as north of scotland every part was blocked or filled up with ice and the whole country from the summits of the mountains down to the very brink of the cliffs which terminate the coast covered many fathoms thick with everlasting snow the cliffs alone were all which was to be seen like land again he adds talking of two islets these only were clear of snow and seemed covered with a green turf in georgia lat to the bays are terminated by ice cliffs of considerable height and according to cook the country in the very height of summer is in a manner wholly covered many fathoms deep with frozen snow but more especially on the southwest coast the only vegetable is a strongbladed grass growing in tufts wild burnet and a plant like moss although miles long and about ten broad it possesses not a single quadruped and only one land bird namely a small titlark an anthus a specimen of which i procured in the falklands this bird if undescribed certainly well deserves the name of antarcticus for although not living within that circle it inhabits a more inhospitable region than any other terrestrial animal anderson in cooks voyage says even in kerguelen land an island miles long by broad and situated in lat corresponding to the extreme southern point of england the whole catalogue of plants does not exceed sixteen or seventeen including some sorts of moss and a beautiful species of lichen which grows upon the rocks higher up than the rest of the vegetable productions nor is there even the least appearance of a shrub in the whole country it is doubtful whether there is a single land bird and then he adds the hills are of a moderate height yet many of their tops were covered with snow at this time though answering to our june these statements forcibly prove the intemperance of the climate even far without the frozen limits of the antarctic circle there are no direct observations by which to judge of the mean temperature of the year in these southern islands but after reading the above accounts it will readily be granted that it must be very low even in georgia in lat it is not improbable that the soil is perpetually frozen at a few feet beneath the surface at deception island in lat from the preservation of the dead body alluded to and the interstratification of ice with the volcanic ashes we may feel almost sure that such must be the case in the northern hemisphere it is only on the great continents that so low a mean temperature is found in corresponding latitudes in north america according to richardson north of lat the thaw does not penetrate to a greater depth than three feet in the steppes of siberia humboldt states that to the northward of the ground between twelve and fifteen feet below the surface is always frozen in the space however between these tw o great northern continents the line of perpetual congelation rises considerably towards the north it is a remarkable meteorological fact that in the northern and southern hemispheres a low mean temperature in latitudes without the frigid zone is the result of a directly opposite condition of things in the northern hemisphere the atmosphere is rendered extremely cold from the radiation of a large extent of country during a long winter nor is it moderated by the warmer currents of any neighbouring sea hence the extreme cold of the winter more than counterbalances the heat of summer in the southern hemisphere on the other hand although the winter is moderate the summer is cold for a sky constantly clouded rarely permits the rays of the sun to warm the surface itself a bad absorbent of the great ocean hence the mean temperature of the year falls below the freezing point it will at once be evident that a kind of vegetation which requires an equable temperature will approach much nearer the line of perpetual congelation in a climate such as this of the southern hemisphere than in the opposite one subject to extremes the height of the plane of perpetual snow in any country seems chiefly to be determined by the extreme heat of summer rather than by the mean of the year as the summer in tierra del fuego is so very wretched we ought not to feel surprised at the fact stated by capt kingthat in the strait of magellan the line descends to about or feet in the northern hemisphere we must travel about fourteen degrees nearer the pole to meet with so low a limit namely between lat and on the mountains of norway in the cordillera of south america between latitudes and the culminant peaks have altitudes pretty nearly equal several were measured by the officers of the beagle with considerable care by angles of elevation the positions of the mountains being accurately known osorno is feet mountain south of osorno minchinmadiva northern end of same range corcovado yntales not only these points but a great part of the range was thickly clothed with snow in the beginning of february answering to our august which descended some way down the mountains and presented to a distant beholder a perfectly horizontal line we were assured that the snow which it appeared must inevitably be the case remained throughout the year on january th after a week of uncommonly fine weather mr king measured with a pocket sextant the angle of this line with the summit of the corcovado and subtracting the result from the total height the snowline was found to descend to feet it is possible that there may have existed some unknown cause of error but as the average height of the few highest peaks in the snowclad range is under feet it is evident that the height of the snowline cannot at most much exceed feet as this is a point of interest i shall mention a few other circumstances by which i think we may come to a nearly definite conclusion on february d i obtained the last view of the cordillera on that day the lower line of the snow descended some way so as to form a considerable angle with the summit when viewed from a distance of miles on the mountain south of osorno lat which stands by itself and has a height of feet since arriving in england i have received a letter from mr douglas in chiloe who describing some volcanic phenomena accidentally mentions the snowline he says on february th same year on the volcano of minchinmadiva lat which has an elevation of feet lava was ejected from a crater just above the verge of the snow again on february th he alludes to the summit of the corcovado feet being covered with snow as was yntales feet in lat again mr douglas speaking of the corcovado says on the th of march the snow appeared to cover onefifth of its visible perpendicular height by this date the snowline must have attained its greatest height if indeed fresh snow had not fallen and as the corcovado rises in an unbroken slope close to the sea the proportion covered by snow might be judged of with some degree of accuracy the height of the corcovado feet was obtained by three angular measurements made by the officers on the survey and the mean nearly agreed with the three separate results reflecting on all these circumstances we may conclude with perfect safety that the limit of perpetual snow between the latitudes and cannot much if at all exceed feet proceeding northward along the cordillera we find a very different condition of things in the pass of the portillo to the southward of dr gillies determined barometrically the height of the double range and he found the two ridges to be respectively and feet on march st and d shortly before fresh snow fell i crossed these mountains and although there were large masses of snow there were much greater spaces at some height on each side uncovered dr gillies says the summit of the volcano of peuquenes is generally covered with snow and its elevation cannot be less than above the level of the sea from these statements compared with my observations the snowline when i crossed certainly was considerably above we may assume as about the limit from the results obtained by humboldt pentland gillies and king we are enabled to draw up the following table of the extraordinary range of the snowline on the cordillera of south america latitude height in feet of snowline observer equatorial region mean result humboldt bolivia lat s pentland central chile lat s to gillies chiloe lat s officers of the beagle tierra del fuego s to king in considering this table and beginning from the south we observe that through the first twelve degrees the height of the snowline rises only a little more than feet in this space the climate and productions of the country are in many respects very uniform in the succeeding nine degrees the rise is no less than nine thousand feet before any one pronounces this to be impossible let him reflect well that the height of the snowline very much depends on the heat of summer in chiloe no fruit excepting apples and strawberries comes to perfection it is even oftentimes necessary to carry the barley and corn into the houses to be ripened on the other hand in central chile even the sugarcane has been cultivated out of doors and during a long summer of seven months the sky is seldom clouded and rain never falls the island of chiloe as well as the neighbouring mainland is concealed by one dense forest dripping with moisture and abounding with ferns and other plants that love a humid atmosphere while the soil of central chile where not irrigated is arid and nearly desert these two countries so remarkably opposed to each other in every character blend together rather suddenly near concepcion in lat i do not doubt the plain of perpetual snow undergoes an extraordinary flexure in the district where the forest ceases for trees indicate a rainy climate and hence a clouded state of atmosphere from central chile to bolivia a space of the rise of the snowline is only feet if bolivia possessed an atmosphere as clear as that of chile the limit in all probability would be even higher than the present the cause why the limit in the equatorial regions should be lower than in a latitude seventeen degrees to the southward i leave to those to explain who have more means of information respecting the dryness and clouded state of the atmosphere in the respective regions the presence of glaciers depends on the accumulation of a large mass of snow subject to some variations of temperature sufficient partially to thaw and then reconsolidate the mass in its downward course they have been aptly compared to gigantic icicles the lower limit of glaciers must depend on that of the parent snow greatly affected by the form of the land in tierra del fuego the snowline descends very low and the mountain sides are abrupt therefore we might expect to find glaciers extending far down their flanks nevertheless when on first beholding in the middle of summer many of the creeks on the northern side of the beagle channel terminated by bold precipices of ice overhanging the salt water i felt greatly astonished for the mountains from which they descended were far from being very lofty captain fitzroy from angular measurements considers the general range to have an elevation rather under feet with one point called chain mountain rising to further inland there is indeed a more lofty mountain of feet but it is not directly connected with the glaciers to which i now allude this range which exceeds by so little the height of some mountains in britain which yet sends down in the middle of summer its frozen streams to the seacoast is situated in the latitude of the cumberland hills i was much interested by observing the great difference between the matter brought down by torrents and by glaciers in the former case a spit of gravel is formed but in the latter a pile of boulders on one occasion the boats being hauled on shore within the distance of half a mile from a glacier we were admiring the perpendicular cliff of blue ice and wishing that some more fragments would fall off like those we saw floating on the water at a distance of more than a mile from their source at last down came a mass with a roaring noise and immediately we saw the smooth outline of a wave travelling towards us the men ran down as quickly as they could to the boats for the chance of their being dashed to pieces was evident one of the seamen just caught hold of the bows as the curling breaker reached it he was knocked over and over but not hurt and the boats though thrice lifted on high and let fall again received no damage this was most fortunate for us for we were a hundred miles distant from the ship and we should have been left without provisions or firearms i had previously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach had been lately displaced but until seeing this wave i did not understand the cause the structure of the creek in which this happened was very curious one side was formed by a spur of mica slate of which rock the surrounding mountains were composed the head by a cliff of ice about forty feet high and the other side by a promontory which was built up of huge rounded fragments of granite and mica slate and was more than fifty feet in height to account for the present position of these blocks where they must have long remained for old trees were growing on the upper parts we must suppose either that the glacier formerly advanced half a mile further outward or that the land stood at a rather different level whether we are able fully to account or not for the height and size of this promontory of boulders certainly it must have been the work of the glacier one semirounded fragment of granite lying just above highwater mark was of enormous dimensions it projected six feet above the sand and was buried to an unknown depth its shape was oval with a circumference of thirty yards so that the longer axis probably measured about ten or eleven this fragment must have come from the higher parts of the range for the base of the mountain was entirely composed of mica slate the waves caused by the fall of the ice must be a most powerful agent in rounding and heaping together these huge fragments and likewise in wearing away projecting points of the solid rock in georgia situated in the very same latitude cook speaking of the great icecliffs at the head of every harbour says pieces were continually breaking off and floating out to sea and a great fall happened while we were in the bay which made a noise like cannon he adds it can hardly be doubted that a great deal of ice is formed here in winter which in the spring is broken off and dispersed over the sea mr sorrell the boatswain of the beagle who has long been accustomed to these seas informs me that at this season he has seen small icebergs with mud and gravel on them floating from the shores i have heard from another quarter of the same circumstance captain hunter says he met numerous iceislands in this neighbourhood and that many were half black apparently with earth from the land to which they had adhered or else with mud from the bottom on which they had been formed by the latter method large fragments might easily be transported and unless the iceberg should be upset they would never be discovered nevertheless the islands of ice floating in the southern ocean and especially those occurring far south appear generally to be quite free from all impurities excepting the dung of seafowl captain biscoe who extended his enterprising researches so far towards the antarctic pole informs me in a letter that he never observed in a single instance any mud or fragments of stone on the numerous icebergs which he encountered during his voyage glaciers occur at the head of the sounds along the whole western coast of the southern part of south america looking at the chart i find sixteen places mentioned besides these i know of several others such as those in the beagle channel and at the foot of mount sarmiento the sounds moreover were not all traced to the head and it is in this part that the glaciers most frequently occur of the sixteen referred to many include several frozen arms coming down from one vast body of ice in the canal of the mountains for instance no less than nine descend from a mountain the whole side of which according to the chart is covered by a glacier of the extraordinary length of twentyone miles and with an average breadth of a mile and a half it must not be supposed that the glacier merely ascends some valley for the twentyone miles but it extends apparently at the same height for that length parallel to the sound and here and there sends down an arm to the seacoast there are other glaciers having a similar structure and position with a length of ten and fifteen miles i will now specify a few of the more remarkable cases taken from captain kings paper to which i have so often referred the canal of st andrew is said by lieutenant skyring to be suddenly and boldly closed by tremendous and astonishing glaciers the highest mountain in this part mount stokes was ascertained during our ascent of the river of st cruz to be feet and this certainly exceeds considerably the height of the general range about ninety miles to the northward sir g eyres sound in the latitude of paris has its several arms terminated by glaciers mr bynoe the surgeon of the beagle who accompanied the boat when this part was surveyed informs me that about midchannel and more than twenty miles from the head of the sound there were great numbers of floating masses of ice standing in the boat he supposes he saw about fifty he together with four of the boats crew landed on one which although only two or three feet above the surface of the water felt quite steady and easily supported their weight on the surface in the central part a mass of granite of an angular form was partly embedded and the ice had thawed all round it so as to form a shallow pool of water it was a cube of nearly two feet and mr bynoe with a maul knocked off and brought away a piece as large as a mans head the iceberg was still floating and drifting outwards even if it had been stranded in the immediate neighbourhood the block of granite would have rested on the clayslate of the surrounding mountains for the parent rock we must look to the higher parts of the range near the head of the sound again a few miles to the northward i see in the chart an iceberg sound which no doubt was so called from the number of floating masses of ice it may be recollected that in this latitude on the opposite side of the cordillera the plains of st cruz at the distance of fifty and sixty miles from the mountains were strewed with great fragments of rock of these one was sixty feet in circumference and another which was angular measured five yards squareboth being partly buried in the gravel so that their thickness was unknown as it is probable that the plains were covered by the sea within a period geologically recent and as we absolutely know that icebergs at the present day both in the same latitude and even further northward are transporting angular blocks from the opposite side of the cordillera the explanation of the st cruz case through the same means of transport is rendered so evidently probable that we are not justified in doubting to receive it more especially as the unbroken surface of those plains and the terraceformed valley opposes a very great difficulty to the admission of any violent debacle the latitudes which we have now been talking of correspond to the southern extremity of cornwall and the northern provinces of france i will add only one other case namely the occurrence of glaciers at the level of the sea in the gulf of penas latitude a glacier is represented in the charts as in one part abutting on a flat swamp often inundated and in another reaching to the head of kelly harbour the accompanying woodcut is copied from the published charts captain king says its length is fifteen miles and from the chart one part is seven broad it is also described as being lofty so that we here have an enormous mountain covering a wide area composed of ice if we compare its situation with countries in the northern hemisphere the corresponding parallel crosses the alps of switzerland or we may state the case stronger by saying that glaciers here descend to the sea within less than nine degrees of latitude from where palms grow less than two and a half from arborescent grasses and looking to the westward in the same hemisphere less than two from orchideous parasites and within a single degree of treeferns in norway von buch found glaciers descending to the sea at kunnen in latitude that is twenty degrees nearer the pole than in this hemispherea difference of latitude rather greater than that between the snowlines of equal altitude in the same two countries the survey of the inner coast terminated at the gulf of penas so that i am far from knowing whether glaciers are not found much further northward and considering the immense size of the one just described it is extremely improbable that it should be the last on the island of chiloe which fronts the cordillera as the jura does the alps many angular fragments of granite of an enormous size which appear to have crossed the inland arm of sea lie scattered at different heights over the country although situated between the parallels of and i know of no sound objection to the supposition that these might formerly have been floated across on icebergs produced by the fall of glaciers we are not bound to suppose that the latitude has always been the northern limit of such phenomena even if it should be so at present we have endeavoured to show that the snowline in the parallel of chiloe has an elevation of about feet and since on mont blanc the glaciers descend feet beneath the line of perpetual snow we might at present expect to find them in front of chiloe at a very small altitude above the level of the sea with respect to the position of the glaciers they seem to occur only within the deep sounds which penetrate the central cordillera this may be attributed chiefly to the subordinate elevation of the outer lines when we consider the vast dimensions and number of these glaciers the effect produced on the land must be very great every one has heard of the mass of rubbish propelled by the glaciers of switzerland as they slowly creep onwards in the same manner in tierra del fuego on a still night the cracking and groaning of the great moving mass may be distinctly heard the same force which is known to uproot whole forests of lofty trees must when grating over the surface tear from the flanks of the mountain many huge fragments of rock beneath each glacier also a roaring torrent drains the upper part of the ice to these effects which are common to all cases there must be added in this country the wear and tear of the waves produced by each successive fall nor can this agency be inconsiderable when we remember that it goes on night and day century after century we must look at every portion of the mountain as having during the gradual rising of the land been successively exposed to the action of these combined forces it is perhaps useless to speculate on the effects of earthquakes without some positive data but as we find in the immediate neighbourhood of that great glacier which stands in the latitude of the alps byron mentioning with surprise the quantities of seashells lying on all the hilltops a fact which may be taken as a proof of recent continental elevations and bulkeley in his narrative saying this day we felt four great earthquakes three of which were very terrible we may feel well assured that the same power which in chile causes such vast masses of rock and soil to fall from the seacliffs has oftentimes precipitated fragments far more immense of a mass traversed by great fissures already in motion and resting on an inclined plane i cannot imagine any scene of more terrific violence than the waves produced by such a fall we know that they are very bad from the mere oscillation consequent on the movements of the ground but in this case i can readily believe that the water would be fairly beaten back out of the deepest inlet and then returning with an overwhelming force would whirl about rocks of vast size like so much chaff in after ages with a climate modified by the process of such physical changes as are now going on throughout the greater part of this continent the effects which had been produced by these glaciers would appear inexplicable to a person who doubted the possibility of their occurrence in such latitudes he would see in the most retired and protected valleys the present channels beaches composed of great rounded boulders such as those heaped up on the shore of the most turbulent ocean then perhaps he would speculate either that the outer chain of mountains had been elevated subsequently to the interior ones so as to protect a coast hitherto exposed or that overwhelming deluges had swept down the valleys and in some manner produced in one day the effects of attrition which on ordinary occasions require the prolonged action of centuries if we could at the present day submerge the greater part of tierra del fuego or leave unelevated that which we know has recently been gained an island with a few small outliers would be formed similar to georgia and situated in exactly the same latitude have we in such case the slightest right to deny the probability that the snowline would descend nearly to the waters edge and that every valley would be terminated by a wall of ice and that in winter masses would be broken off and dispersed over the seaall of which circumstances are now happening in georgia the currents which always set from the westward towards the east would drift these floating masses through the channels towards the eastern side and as we know that icebergs at the present day in both hemispheres occasionally transport fragments of rock so we cannot deny that those of tierra del fuego might formerly have done so when the land was elevated the fragments of rock would be found deposited on the eastern side of the continent in bands representing the ancient channels whether or not the hypothesis of their transport be true such is the position of the erratic blocks in tierra del fuego with respect to the general theory of the transport by great fragments of ice especially of such as are angular i may add a few remarks humboldt having observed that none occurred over the vast intertropical plains of the eastern side of south america believed that they were entirely absent from the whole continent as far as i am able to discover from the works of travellers and from what i have myself seen the remark holds good in the countries on both sides of the cordillera as far south as central chile azara has particularly stated such to be the case in chaco with respect to the tributaries of the amazons nothing can more strongly prove it than la condamines story he says below borja even for four or five hundred leagues a stone even a single flint is as great a rarity as a diamond would be the savages of those countries dont know what a stone is and have not even a notion of it it is diversion enough to see some of them when they come to borja and first meet with stones express their admiration at them with signs and be eager to pick them up loading themselves therewith as with a valuable merchandise it is therefore a remarkable circumstance that as soon as we reach the colder latitudes in the southern hemisphere from to cape horn the same phenomenon occurs almost on as grand a scale and with similar limits as in the northern parts both of the old and new world neither in the southern nor in the northern hemisphere do the fragments coming from the polar regions or from other mountain groups arrive within a considerable distance of the lines of the tropics we must couple the absence of erratic blocks along that part of the andes which is situated under a warmer climate with the similar nonoccurrence as i am informed by professor royle in northern india round the flanks of the himmalayathose loftiest pinnacles on the face of the globe with regard to southern africa from lat to the tropic dr andrew smith who has visited as a naturalist so large a portion of the interior assures me he has never seen any thing of the kind nor do i recollect meeting with any mention of them in the works of the numerous travellers in the equatorial regions of the same continent the same remark certainly holds good with australia in the parallel of sydney but perhaps is more doubtful with respect to van diemens land to my mind these negative facts have very great weight in support of the mass of positive evidence which mr lyell has brought to bear upon the question the circumstance of a luxuriant vegetation with a tropical character so largely encroaching on the temperate zones under the same kind of climate that allows of a limit of perpetual snow of little altitude and consequent descent of the glaciers into the sea is very important because it has been argued with great apparent truth that as there is the strongest presumptive evidence of a gradual cooling down of the climate or rather of a less favourable state for tropical productions in europe it is most unphilosophical to imagine that formerly glaciers could have acted where they do not now occur it may be asked what are the circumstances in the southern hemisphere that produce such results must we not attribute them to the large proportional area of water and do not plain geological inferences compel us to allow that during the epoch anterior to the present the northern hemisphere more closely approached to that condition than it now does we are all so much better acquainted with the position of places in our own than in any other quarter of the globe that i will recapitulate what is actually taking place in the southern hemisphere only transporting in imagination each part to a corresponding latitude in the north on this supposition in the southern provinces of france magnificent forests intwined by arborescent grasses and the trees loaded with parasitical plants would cover the face of the country in the latitude of mont blanc but on an island as far eastward as central siberia treeferns and parasitical orchide√¶ would thrive amidst the thick woods even as far north as central denmark hummingbirds might be seen fluttering about delicate flowers and parrots feeding amidst the evergreen woods with which the mountains would be clothed down to the waters edge nevertheless the southern part of scotland only removed twice as far to the westward would present an island almost wholly covered with everlasting snow and having each bay terminated by icecliffs from which great masses yearly detached would sometimes bear with them fragments of rock this island would only boast of one land bird a little grass and moss yet in the same latitude the sea might swarm with living creatures a chain of mountains which we will call the cordillera running north and south through the alps but having an altitude much inferior to the latter would connect them with the central part of denmark along this whole line nearly every deep sound would end in bold and astonishing glaciers in the alps themselves with their altitude reduced by about half we should find proofs of recent elevations and occasionally terrible earthquakes would cause such masses of ice to be precipitated into the sea that waves tearing all before them would heap together enormous fragments and pile them up in the corners of the valleys at other times icebergs charged with no inconsiderable blocks of granite would be floated from the flanks of mont blanc and then stranded on the outlying islands of the jura who then will deny the possibility of these things having actually taken place in europe during a former period and under circumstances known to be different from the present when on merely looking to the other hemisphere we see they are among the daily order of events to the northward of our new cape horn we should only have certain knowledge of a few island groups situated in the latitude of the south part of norway and others in that of ferroe these in the middle of summer would be buried under snow and surrounded by walls of ice so that scarcely a living thing of any kind would be supported on the land if some bold navigator attempted to penetrate beyond these islands towards the pole he would run a thousand dangers and only meet an ocean strewed with mountainmasses of ice at the ferroe islands or we may say a little to the southward of the wiljui where pallas found in lat n the frozen rhinoceros a body buried under the surface of the soil would undergo so little decomposition that years afterwards as in the instance mentioned at south shetland s every feature might be recognised perfect and unchanged i particularly allude to this circumstance because the case of the siberian animals preserved with their flesh in the ice offers the same apparent difficulty with the glaciers namely the union in the same hemisphere of a climate in some senses severe with one allowing of the life of those forms which at present although abounding without the tropics do not approach the frozen zones the perfect preservation of the siberian animals perhaps presented till within a few years one of the most difficult problems which geology ever attempted to solve on the one hand it was granted that the carcasses had not been drifted from any great distance by any tumultuous deluge and on the other it was assumed as certain that when the animals lived the climate must have been so totally different that the presence of ice in the vicinity was as incredible as would be the freezing of the ganges mr lyell in his principles of geology has thrown the greatest light on this subject by indicating the northerly course of the existing rivers with the probability that they formerly carried carcasses in the same direction by showing from humboldt how far the inhabitants of the hottest countries sometimes wander by insisting on the caution necessary in judging of habits between animals of the same genius when the species are not identical and especially by bringing forward in the clearest manner the probable change from an insular to an extreme climate as the consequence of the elevation of the land of which proofs have lately been brought to light in a former part of this volume i have endeavoured to prove that as far as regards the quantity of food there is no difficulty in supposing that these large quadrupeds inhabited sterile regions producing but a scanty vegetation with respect to temperature the woolly covering both of the elephant and the rhinoceros seems at once to render it at least probable although it has been argued that some animals living in the hottest regions are thickly clothed that they were fitted for a cold climate i suppose no reason can be assigned why during a former epoch when the pachydermata abounded over the greater part of the world some species should not have been fitted for the northern regions precisely as now happens with deer and several other animals if then we believe that the climate of siberia anteriorly to the physical changes above alluded to had some resemblance with that of the southern hemisphere at the present daya circumstance which harmonizes well with other facts as i think has been shown by the imaginary case when we transported existing phenomena from one to the other hemispherethe following conclusions may be deduced as probable first that the degree of cold formerly was not excessive secondly that snow did not for a long time together cover the ground such not being the case at the extreme parts of s america thirdly that the vegetation partook of a more tropical character than it now does in the same latitudes and lastly that at but a short distance to the northward of the country thus circumstanced even not so far as where pallas found the entire rhinoceros the soil might be perpetually congealed so that if the carcass of any animal should once be buried a few feet beneath the surface it would be preserved for centuries both humboldt and lyell have remarked that at the present day the bodies of any animals wandering beyond the line of perpetual congelation which extends as far south as if once embedded by any accident a few feet beneath the surface would be preserved for an indefinite length of time the same would happen with carcasses drifted by the rivers and by such means the extinct mammalia may have been entombed there is only one small step wanting as it appears to me and the whole problem would be solved with a degree of simplicity very striking compared with the several theories first invented from the account given by those which i found adjoining the glaciers presently existing between londfiord and lomb see ed new phil journal p october these facts afford a very strong and admirable confirmation of the view that the climate of europe has been gradually changing from a character resembling that of the southern hemisphere to its present condition for on this hypothesis we might have anticipated that proofs would have been discovered that glaciers formerly descended to a lower altitude than they now do and yet that the organic remains of that epoch instead of a former period of refrigeration would have indicated a climate of a more tropical charactera conclusion which may be deduced from plain geological evidence mr lyell of the siberian plains with their innumerable fossil bones the relics of many successive generations there can be little doubt that the beds were accumulated either in a shallow sea or in an estuary from the description given in beecheys voyage of eschscholtz bay the same remark is applicable to the northwest coast of america the formation there appears identical with the common littoral deposits recently elevated which i have seen on the shores of the southern part of the same continent it seems also well established that the siberian remains are only exposed where the rivers intersect the plain with this fact and the proofs of recent elevation the whole case appears to be precisely similar to that of the pampas namely that the carcasses were formerly floated into the sea and the remains covered up in the deposits which were then accumulating these beds have since been elevated and as the rivers excavate their channels the entombed skeletons are exposed here then is the difficulty how were the carcasses preserved at the bottom of the sea i do not think it has been sufficiently noticed that the preservation of the animal with its flesh was an occasional event and not directly consequent on its position far northward cuvier refers to the voyage of billing as showing that the bones of the elephant buffalo and rhinoceros are nowhere so abundant as on the islands between the mouths of the lena and indigirska it is even said that excepting some hills of rock the whole is composed of sand ice and bones these islands lie to the northward of the place where adams found the mammoth with its flesh preserved and even ten degrees north of the wiljui where the rhinoceros was discovered in a like condition in the case of the bones we may suppose that the carcasses were drifted into a deeper sea and there remaining at the bottom the flesh decomposed but in the second and more extraordinary case where putrefaction seems to have been arrested the body probably was soon covered up by deposits which were then accumulating it may be asked whether the mud a few feet deep at the bottom of a shallow sea which is annually frozen has a temperature higher than it must be remembered how intense a degree of cold is required to freeze salt water and that the mud at some depth below the surface would have a low mean temperature precisely in the same manner as the subsoil on the land is frozen in countries which enjoy a short but hot summer if this be possible the entombment of these extinct quadrupeds is rendered very simple and with regard to the conditions of their former existence the principal difficulties have i think already been removed having concluded this long discussion on the analogies which may be drawn from the existing climate of the southern parts of america together with its productions we will return to the description of tierra del fuego there is one vegetable production in this country which is worthy of mention as it affords a staple article of food to the aborigines it is a globular fungus of a bright yellow colour and of about the size of a small apple which adheres in vast numbers to the bark of the beechtrees it probably forms a new genus allied to the morell in the young state it is elastic and turgid from being charged with moisture the external skin is smooth yet slightly marked with small circular pits like those from the smallpox when cut in two the inside is seen to consist of a white fleshy substance which viewed under a high power resembles from the numerous threadlike cylinders vermicelli close beneath the surface cupshaped balls about onetwelfth of an inch in diameter are arranged at regular intervals these cups are filled with a slightly adhesive yet elastic colourless quite transparent matter and from the latter character they at first appeared empty these little gelatinous balls could be easily detached from the surrounding mass except at the upper extremity where the edge divided itself into threads which mingled with the rest of the vermicellilike mass the external skin directly above each of the balls is pitted and as the fungus grows old it is ruptured and the gelatinous mass which no doubt contains the sporules is disseminated after this process of fructification has taken place the whole surface becomes honeycombed with empty cells as represented in the accompanying woodcut and the fungus shrinks and grows tougher in this state it is eaten by the fuegians in large quantities uncooked and when well chewed has a mucilaginous and slightly sweet taste together with a faint odour like that of a mushroom excepting a few berries of a dwarf arbutus which need hardly be taken into the account these poor savages never eat any other vegetable food besides this fungus i have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the forests in which two or three species of trees grow to the exclusion of all others above the forest land there are many dwarf alpine plants which all spring from the mass of peat and help to compose it the central part of tierra del fuego where the clayslate formation occurs is most favourable to the growth of trees on the outer coast the poorer granitic soil and a situation more exposed to the violent winds do not allow of their attaining any great size near port famine i have seen more large trees than any where else i measured a winters bark which was four feet six inches in girth and several of the beech were thirteen feet captain king also mentions one of the latter which was seven feet in diameter seventeen feet above the roots the zoology of tierra del fuego as might have been expected from the nature of its climate and vegetation is very poor of mammalia besides cetacea and phoc√¶ there is one bat a mouse with grooved front teeth reithrodon of waterhouse and two other species the tucutuco the greater number of these rodents are confined to the eastern and dry part a fox seaotter guanaco and one deer the latter animal is rare and is not i believe to be found south of the strait of magellan as happens with the others observing the general correspondence of the cliffs of soft sandstone mud and shingle on the opposite sides of the strait together with those on some intervening islands one is strongly tempted to believe that the land was once joined and thus allowed animals so delicate and helpless as the tucutuco and reithrodon to pass over the correspondence of the cliffs is far from proving any junction because such cliffs generally are formed by the intersection of sloping deposits which before the elevation of the land had been accumulated near the then existing shores it is however a remarkable coincidence that in the two large islands cut off by the beagle channel from the rest of tierra del fuego one has cliffs composed of matter that may be called stratified
