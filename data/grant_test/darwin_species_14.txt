our best systematists we have no written pedigrees we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind therefore we choose those characters which as far as we can judge are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed rudimentary structures on this view are as good as or even sometimes better than other parts of the organisation we care not how trifling a character may belet it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw the manner in which an insects wing is folded whether the skin be covered by hair or feathersif it prevail throughout many and different species especially those having very different habits of life it assumes high value for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits only by its inheritance from a common parent we may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure but when several characters let them be ever so trifling occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits we may feel almost sure on the theory of descent that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor and we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in classification we can understand why a species or a group of species may depart in several of its most important characteristics from its allies and yet be safely classed with them this may be safely done and is often done as long as a sufficient number of characters let them be ever so unimportant betrays the hidden bond of community of descent let two forms have not a single character in common yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups we may at once infer their community of descent and we put them all into the same class as we find organs of high physiological importancethose which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existenceare generally the most constant we attach especial value to them but if these same organs in another group or section of a group are found to differ much we at once value them less in our classification we shall hereafter i think clearly see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large and widelydistributed genera because all the species of the same genus inhabiting any distinct and isolated region have in all probability descended from the same parents we can understand on these views the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances lamarck first called attention to this distinction and he has been ably followed by macleay and others the resemblance in the shape of the body and in the finlike anterior limbs between the dugong which is a pachydermatous animal and the whale and between both these mammals and fishes is analogical amongst insects there are innumerable instances thus linn√¶us misled by external appearances actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth we see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip the resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals on my view of characters being of real importance for classification only in so far as they reveal descent we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being are almost valueless to the systematist for animals belonging to two most distinct lines of descent may readily become adapted to similar conditions and thus assume a close external resemblance but such resemblances will not revealwill rather tend to conceal their bloodrelationship to their proper lines of descent we can also understand the apparent paradox that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another thus the shape of the body and finlike limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water but the shape of the body and finlike limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family for these cetaceans agree in so many characters great and small that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor so it is with fishes as members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstancesto inhabit for instance the three elements of land air and waterwe can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups in distinct classes a naturalist struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range and thus the septenary quinary quaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen as the modified descendants of dominant species belonging to the larger genera tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant they are almost sure to spread widely and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature the larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups thus we can account for the fact that all organisms recent and extinct are included under a few great orders under still fewer classes and all in one great natural system as showing how few the higher groups are in number and how widely spread they are throughout the world the fact is striking that the discovery of australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order and that in the vegetable kingdom as i learn from dr hooker it has added only two or three orders of small size in the chapter on geological succession i attempted to show on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the longcontinued process of modification how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups a few old and intermediate parentforms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified will give to us our socalled osculant or aberrant groups the more aberrant any form is the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost and we have some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction for they are generally represented by extremely few species and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other which again implies extinction the genera ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren for example would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one but such richness in species as i find after some investigation does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera we can i think account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances mr waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group this affinity in most cases is general and not special thus according to mr waterhouse of all rodents the bizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials but in the points in which it approaches this order its relations are general and not to any one marsupial species more than to another as the points of affinity of the bizcacha to marsupials are believed to be real and not merely adaptive they are due on my theory to inheritance in common therefore we must suppose either that all rodents including the bizcacha branched off from some very ancient marsupial which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing marsupials or that both rodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions on either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained by inheritance more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other rodents and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing marsupial but indirectly to all or nearly all marsupials from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor or of an early member of the group on the other hand of all marsupials as mr waterhouse has remarked the phascolomys resembles most nearly not any one species but the general order of rodents in this case however it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a rodent the elder de candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants on the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common parent together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together for the common parent of a whole family of species now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and subgroups will have transmitted some of its characters modified in various ways and degrees to all and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to mounting up through many predecessors as it is difficult to show the bloodrelationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family even by the aid of a genealogical tree and almost impossible to do this without this aid we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing without the aid of a diagram the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class extinction as we have seen in the fourth chapter has played an important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each otherfor instance of birds from all other vertebrate animalsby the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes there has been less entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with batrachians there has been still less in some other classes as in that of the crustacea for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long but broken chain of affinities extinction has only separated groups it has by no means made them for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties nevertheless a natural classification or at least a natural arrangement would be possible we shall see this by turning to the diagram the letters a to l may represent eleven silurian genera some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants every intermediate link between these eleven genera and their primordial parent and every intermediate link in each branch and subbranch of their descendants may be supposed to be still alive and the links to be as fine as those between the finest varieties in this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents or these parents from their ancient and unknown progenitor yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and on the principle of inheritance all the forms descended from a or from i would have something in common in a tree we can specify this or that branch though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together we could not as i have said define the several groups but we could pick out types or forms representing most of the characters of each group whether large or small and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them this is what we should be driven to if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time and space we shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a collection nevertheless in certain classes we are tending in this direction and milne edwards has lately insisted in an able paper on the high importance of looking to types whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong finally we have seen that natural selection which results from the struggle for existence and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant parentspecies explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings namely their subordination in group under group we use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages although having few characters in common under one species we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties however different they may be from their parent and i believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the natural system on this idea of the natural system being in so far as it has been perfected genealogical in its arrangement with the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent expressed by the terms genera families orders c we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification we can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs or others of trifling physiological importance why in comparing one group with a distinct group we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group we can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great system and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities we shall never probably disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the members of any one class but when we have a distinct object in view and do not look to some unknown plan of creation we may hope to make sure but slow progress morphologywe have seen that the members of the same class independently of their habits of life resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation this resemblance is often expressed by the term unity of type or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous the whole subject is included under the general name of morphology this is the most interesting department of natural history and may be said to be its very soul what can be more curious than that the hand of a man formed for grasping that of a mole for digging the leg of the horse the paddle of the porpoise and the wing of the bat should all be constructed on the same pattern and should include the same bones in the same relative positions geoffroy st hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size and yet they always remain connected together in the same order we never find for instance the bones of the arm and forearm or of the thigh and leg transposed hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals we see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinxmoth the curious folded one of a bee or bug and the great jaws of a beetleyet all these organs serving for such different purposes are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip mandibles and two pairs of maxill√¶ analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans so it is with the flowers of plants nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class by utility or by the doctrine of final causes the hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by owen in his most interesting work on the nature of limbs on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being we can only say that so it isthat it has so pleased the creator to construct each animal and plant the explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modificationseach modification being profitable in some way to the modified form but often affecting by correlation of growth other parts of the organisation in changes of this nature there will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern or to transpose parts the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane so as to serve as a fin or a webbed foot might have all its bones or certain bones lengthened to any extent and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent so as to serve as a wing yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts if we suppose that the ancient progenitor the archetype as it may be called of all mammals had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern for whatever purpose they served we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class so with the mouths of insects we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip mandibles and two pair of maxill√¶ these parts being perhaps very simple in form and then natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects nevertheless it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts by the soldering together of other parts and by the doubling or multiplication of othersvariations which we know to be within the limits of possibility in the paddles of the extinct gigantic sealizards and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans the general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class but of the different parts or organs in the same individual most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous withthat is correspond in number and in relative connexion withthe elemental parts of a certain number of vertebr√¶ the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans it is familiar to almost every one that in a flower the relative position of the sepals petals stamens and pistils as well as their intimate structure are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves arranged in a spire in monstrous plants we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals and in flowers that organs which when mature become extremely different are at an early stage of growth exactly alike how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone as owen has remarked the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat used as they are for such totally different purposes why should one crustacean which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts consequently always have fewer legs or conversely those with many legs have simpler mouths why should the sepals petals stamens and pistils in any individual flower though fitted for such widely different purposes be all constructed on the same pattern on the theory of natural selection we can satisfactorily answer these questions in the vertebrata we see a series of internal vertebr√¶ bearing certain processes and appendages in the articulata we see the body divided into a series of segments bearing external appendages and in flowering plants we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic as owen has observed of all low or littlemodified forms therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebr√¶ the unknown progenitor of the articulata many segments and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants many spiral whorls of leaves we have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure consequently it is quite probable that natural selection during a longcontinued course of modification should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements many times repeated and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes and as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or organs a certain degree of fundamental resemblance retained by the strong principle of inheritance in the great class of molluscs though we can homologise the parts of one species with those of another and distinct species we can indicate but few serial homologies that is we are seldom enabled to say that one part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual and we can understand this fact for in molluscs even in the lowest members of the class we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebr√¶ the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves but it would in these cases probably be more correct as professor huxley has remarked to speak of both skull and vertebr√¶ both jaws and legs cas having been metamorphosed not one from the other but from some common element naturalists however use such language only in a metaphorical sense they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent primordial organs of any kindvertebr√¶ in the one case and legs in the otherhave actually been modified into skulls or jaws yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification on my view these terms may be used literally and the wonderful fact of the jaws for instance of a crab retaining numerous characters which they would probably have retained through inheritance if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs or from some simple appendage is explained embryologyit has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes are in the embryo exactly alike the embryos also of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar a better proof of this cannot be given than a circumstance mentioned by agassiz namely that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal bird or reptile the vermiform larv√¶ of moths flies beetles c resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects but in the case of larv√¶ the embryos are active and have been adapted for special lines of life a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance sometimes lasts till a rather late age thus birds of the same genus and of closely allied genera often resemble each other in their first and second plumage as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush group in the cat tribe most of the species are striped or spotted in lines and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion we occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in plants thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminos√¶ the points of structure in which the embryos of widely different animals of the same class resemble each other often have no direct relation to their conditions of existence we cannot for instance suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar looplike course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditionsin the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest and in the spawn of a frog under water we have no more reason to believe in such a relation than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of a man wing of a bat and fin of a porpoise are related to similar conditions of life no one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp of a lion or the spots on the young blackbird are of any use to these animals or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed the case however is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic career is active and has to provide for itself the period of activity may come on earlier or later in life but whenever it comes on the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal from such special adaptations the similarity of the larv√¶ or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes much obscured and cases could be given of the larv√¶ of two species or of two groups of species differing quite as much or even more from each other than do their adult parents in most cases however the larv√¶ though active still obey more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance cirripedes afford a good instance of this even the illustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was as it certainly is a crustacean but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner so again the two main divisions of cirripedes the pedunculated and sessile which differ widely in external appearance have larv√¶ in all their several stages barely distinguishable the embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation i use this expression though i am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower but no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar in some cases however the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the scale than the larva as with certain parasitic crustaceans to refer once again to cirripedes the larv√¶ in the first stage have three pairs of legs a very simple single eye and a probosciformed mouth with which they feed largely for they increase much in size in the second stage answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs a pair of magnificent compound eyes and extremely complex antenn√¶ but they have a closed and imperfect mouth and cannot feed their function at this stage is to search by their welldeveloped organs of sense and to reach by their active powers of swimming a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis when this is completed they are fixed for life their legs are now converted into prehensile organs they again obtain a wellconstructed mouth but they have no antenn√¶ and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute single and very simple eyespot in this last and complete state cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition but in some genera the larv√¶ become developed either into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure or into what i have called complemental males and in the latter the development has assuredly been retrograde for the male is a mere sack which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth stomach or other organ of importance excepting for reproduction we are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the embryo and the adult and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of widely different animals within the same class that we might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth but there is no obvious reason why for instance the wing of a bat or the fin of a porpoise should not have been sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo and in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult thus owen has remarked in regard to cuttlefish there is no metamorphosis the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed and again in spiders there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis the larv√¶ of insects whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits or quite inactive being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment yet nearly all pass through a similar wormlike stage of development but in some few cases as in that of aphis if we look to the admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development of this insect we see no trace of the vermiform stage how then can we explain these several facts in embryologynamely the very general but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adultof parts in the same indivividual embryo which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes being at this early period of growth alikeof embryos of different species within the same class generally but not universally resembling each otherof the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itselfof the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal into which it is developed i believe that all these facts can be explained as follows on the view of descent with modification it is commonly assumed perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the embryo at a very early period that slight variations necessarily appear at an equally early period but we have little evidence on this headindeed the evidence rather points the other way for it is notorious that breeders of cattle horses and various fancy animals cannot positively tell until some time after the animal has been born what its merits or form will ultimately turn out we see this plainly in our own children we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short or what its precise features will be the question is not at what period of life any variation has been caused but at what period it is fully displayed the cause may have acted and i believe generally has acted even before the embryo is formed and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which either parent or their ancestors have been exposed nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period even before the formation of the embryo may appear late in life as when an hereditary disease which appears in old age alone has been communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one parent or again as when the horns of crossbred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either parent for the welfare of a very young animal as long as it remains in its mothers womb or in the egg or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life it would not signify for instance to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length as long as it was fed by its parents hence i conclude that it is quite possible that each of the many successive modifications by which each species has acquired its present structure may have supervened at a not very early period of life and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports this view but in other cases it is quite possible that each successive modification or most of them may have appeared at an extremely early period i have stated in the first chapter that there is some evidence to render it probable that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages for instance peculiarities in the caterpillar cocoon or imago states of the silkmoth or again in the horns of almost fullgrown cattle but further than this variations which for all that we can see might have appeared earlier or later in life tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent i am far from meaning that this is invariably the case and i could give a good many cases of variations taking the word in the largest sense which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent these two principles if their truth be admitted will i believe explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology but first let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties some authors who have written on dogs maintain that the greyhound and bulldog though appearing so different are really varieties most closely allied and have probably descended from the same wild stock hence i was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other i was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents and this judging by the eye seemed almost to be the case but on actually measuring the old dogs and their sixdays old puppies i found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference so again i was told that the foals of cart and racehorses differed as much as the fullgrown animals and this surprised me greatly as i think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a threedays old colt of a race and heavy carthorse i find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference as the evidence appears to me conclusive that the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species i compared young pigeons of various breeds within twelve hours after being hatched i carefully measured the proportions but will not here give details of the beak width of mouth length of nostril and of eyelid size of feet and length of leg in the wild stock in pouters fantails runts barbs dragons carriers and tumblers now some of these birds when mature differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak that they would i cannot doubt be ranked in distinct genera had they been natural productions but when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row though most of them could be distinguished from each other yet their proportional differences in the above specified several points were incomparably less than in the fullgrown birds some characteristic points of differencefor instance that of the width of mouthcould hardly be detected in the young but there was one remarkable exception to this rule for the young of the shortfaced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rockpigeon and of the other breeds in all its proportions almost exactly as much as in the adult state the two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties fanciers select their horses dogs and pigeons for breeding when they are nearly grown up they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life if the fullgrown animal possesses them and the cases just given more especially that of pigeons seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed and which have been accumulated by mans selection have not generally first appeared at an early period of life and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period but the case of the shortfaced tumbler which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions proves that this is not the universal rule for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual or if not so the differences must have been inherited not at the corresponding but at an earlier age now let us apply these facts and the above two principleswhich latter though not proved true can be shown to be in some degree probableto species in a state of nature let us take a genus of birds descended on my theory from some one parentspecies and of which the several new species have become modified through natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits then from the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late age and having been inherited at a corresponding age the young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the adults just as we have seen in the case of pigeons we may extend this view to whole families or even classes the forelimbs for instance which served as legs in the parentspecies may become by a long course of modification adapted in one descendant to act as hands in another as paddles in another as wings and on the above two principlesnamely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late age and being inherited at a corresponding late agethe forelimbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the parentspecies will still resemble each other closely for they will not have been modified but in each individual new species the embryonic forelimbs will differ greatly from the forelimbs in the mature animal the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather late period of life and having thus been converted into hands or paddles or wings whatever influence longcontinued exercise or use on the one hand and disuse on the other may have in modifying an organ such influence will mainly affect the mature animal which has come to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age whereas the young will remain unmodified or be modified in a lesser degree by the effects of use and disuse in certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene from causes of which we are wholly ignorant at a very early period of life or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared in either case as with the shortfaced tumbler the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parentform we have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals as with cuttlefish and spiders and with a few members of the great class of insects as with aphis with respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies firstly from the young during a course of modification carried on for many generations having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of development and secondly from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents for in this case it would be indispensable for the existence of the species that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents in accordance with their similar habits some further explanation however of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite if on the other hand it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner then on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages the active young or larv√¶ might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents such differences might also become correlated with successive stages of development so that the larv√¶ in the first stage might differ greatly from the larv√¶ in the second stage as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes the adult might become fitted for sites or habits in which organs of locomotion or of the senses c would be useless and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde as all the organic beings extinct and recent which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together and as all have been connected by the finest gradations the best or indeed if our collections were nearly perfect the only possible arrangement would be genealogical descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system on this view we can understand how it is that in the eyes of most naturalists the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult for the embryo is the animal in its less modified state and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor in two groups of animal however much they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits if they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar parents and are therefore in that degree closely related thus community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent it will reveal this community of descent however much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured we have seen for instance that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larv√¶ as belonging to the great class of crustaceans as the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendantsour existing species agassiz believes this to be a law of nature but i am bound to confess that i only hope to see the law hereafter proved true it can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state now supposed to be represented in many embryos has not been obliterated either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early age or by the variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared it should also be borne in mind that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms may be true but yet owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time may remain for a long period or for ever incapable of demonstration thus as it seems to me the leading facts in embryology which are second in importance to none in natural history are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life of each though perhaps caused at the earliest and being inherited at a corresponding not early period embryology rises greatly in interest when we thus look at the embryo as a picture more or less obscured of the common parentform of each great class of animals rudimentary atrophied or aborted organsorgans or parts in this strange condition bearing the stamp of inutility are extremely common throughout nature for instance rudimentary mamm√¶ are very general in the males of mammals i presume that the bastardwing in birds may be safely considered as a digit in a rudimentary state in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind limbs some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious for instance the presence of teeth in f≈ìtal whales which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads and the presence of teeth which never cut through the gums in the upper jaws of our unborn calves it has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight and not rarely lying under wingcases firmly soldered together the meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable for instance there are beetles of the same genus and even of the same species resembling each other most closely in all respects one of which will have fullsized wings and another mere rudiments of membrane and here it is impossible to doubt that the rudiments represent wings rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality and are merely not developed this seems to be the case with the mamm√¶ of male mammals for many instances are on record of these organs having become well developed in fullgrown males and having secreted milk so again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus bos but in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk in individual plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments and sometimes in a welldeveloped state in plants with separated sexes the male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil and k√∂lreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size and this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature an organ serving for two purposes may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one even the more important purpose and remain perfectly efficient for the other thus in plants the office of the pistil is to allow the pollentubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its base the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style but in some composit√¶ the male florets which of course cannot be fecundated have a pistil which is in a rudimentary state for it is not crowned with a stigma but the style remains well developed and is clothed with hairs as in other composit√¶ for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers again an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose and be used for a distinct object in certain fish the swimbladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung other similar instances could be given rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development and in other respects moreover in closely allied species the degree to which the same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much this latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted and this implies that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ which analogy would lead us to expect to find and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species thus in the snapdragon antirrhinum we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen but this may sometimes be seen in tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class nothing is more common or more necessary than the use and discovery of rudiments this is well shown in the drawings given by owen of the bones of the leg of the horse ox and rhinoceros it is an important fact that rudimentary organs such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants can often be detected in the embryo but afterwards wholly disappear it is also i believe a universal rule that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo than in the adult so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary hence also a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to have retained its embryonic condition i have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs in reflecting on them every one must be struck with astonishment for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless in works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created for the sake of symmetry or in order to complete the scheme of nature but this seems to me no explanation merely a restatement of the fact would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun satellites follow the same course round the planets for the sake of symmetry and to complete the scheme of nature an eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess or injurious to the system but can we suppose that the minute papilla which often represents the pistil in male flowers and which is formed merely of cellular tissue can thus act can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed can be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime when a mans fingers have been amputated imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps i could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared not from unknown laws of growth but in order to excrete horny matter as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose on my view of descent with modification the origin of rudimentary organs is simple we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productionsas the stump of a tail in tailless breedsthe vestige of an ear in earless breedsthe reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle more especially according to youatt in young animalsand the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower we often see rudiments of various parts in monsters but i doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature further than by showing that rudiments can be produced for i doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes i believe that disuse has been the main agency that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs until they have become rudimentaryas in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands which have seldom been forced to take flight and have ultimately lost the power of flying again an organ useful under certain conditions might become injurious under others as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands and in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary any change in function which can be effected by insensibly small steps is within the power of natural selection so that an organ rendered during changed habits of life useless or injurious for one purpose might easily be modified and used for another purpose or an organ might be retained for one alone of its former functions an organ when rendered useless may well be variable for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection at whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its full powers of action the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo thus we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo and their lesser relative size in the adult but if each step of the process of reduction were to be inherited not at the corresponding age but at an extremely early period of life as we have good reason to believe to be possible the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost and we should have a case of complete abortion the principle also of economy explained in a former chapter by which the materials forming any part or structure if not useful to the possessor will be saved as far as is possible will probably often come into play and this will tend to cause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ as the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation which has long existed to be inheritedwe can understand on the genealogical view of classification how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as or even sometimes more useful than parts of high physiological importance rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word still retained in the spelling but become useless in the pronunciation but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation on the view of descent with modification we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary imperfect and useless condition or quite aborted far from presenting a strange difficulty as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation might even have been anticipated and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance summaryin this chapter i have attempted to show that the subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time that the nature of the relationship by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex radiating and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications the value set upon characters if constant and prevalent whether of high vital importance or of the most trifling importance or as in rudimentary organs of no importance the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters and characters of true affinity and other such rulesall naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied together with their modification through natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character in considering this view of classification it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes ages and acknowledged varieties of the same species however different they may be in structure if we extend the use of this element of descentthe only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beingswe shall understand what is meant by the natural system it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties species genera families orders and classes on this same view of descent with modification all the great facts in morphology become intelligible whether we look to the same pattern displayed in the homologous organs to whatever purpose applied of the different species of a class or to the homologous parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and plant on the principle of successive slight variations not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life and being inherited at a corresponding period we can understand the great leading facts in embryology namely the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or organs though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible larv√¶ are active embryos which have become specially modified in relation to their habits of life through the principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages on this same principleand bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size either from disuse or selection it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritancethe occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion present to us no inexplicable difficulties on the contrary their presence might have been even anticipated the importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible
