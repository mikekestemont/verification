all these forms be considered as independently created species that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other so as to produce the intermediate form but the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire in some degree the character of the same part or organ in an allied species i have collected a long list of such cases but here as before i lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them i can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur and seem to me very remarkable i will however give one curious and complex case not indeed as affecting any important character but from occurring in several species of the same genus partly under domestication and partly under nature it is a case apparently of reversion the ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs like those on the legs of a zebra it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal and from inquiries which i have made i believe this to be true it has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double the shoulderstripe is certainly very variable in length and outline a white ass but not an albino has been described without either spinal or shoulderstripe and these stripes are sometimes very obscure or actually quite lost in darkcoloured asses the koulan of pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulderstripe the hemionus has no shoulderstripe but traces of it as stated by mr blyth and others occasionally appear and i have been informed by colonel poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder the quagga though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body is without bars on the legs but dr gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebralike bars on the hocks with respect to the horse i have collected cases in england of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds and of all colours transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns mouseduns and in one instance in a chestnut a faint shoulderstripe may sometimes be seen in duns and i have seen a trace in a bay horse my son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun belgian carthorse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with legstripes and a man whom i can implicitly trust has examined for me a small dun welch pony with three short parallel stripes on each shoulder in the northwest part of india the kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped that as i hear from colonel poole who examined the breed for the indian government a horse without stripes is not considered as purelybred the spine is always striped the legs are generally barred and the shoulderstripe which is sometimes double and sometimes treble is common the side of the face moreover is sometimes striped the stripes are plainest in the foal and sometimes quite disappear in old horses colonel poole has seen both gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first foaled i have also reason to suspect from information given me by mr w w edwards that with the english racehorse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the fullgrown animal without here entering on further details i may state that i have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries from britain to eastern china and from norway in the north to the malay archipelago in the south in all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouseduns by the term dun a large range of colour is included from one between brown and black to a close approach to creamcolour i am aware that colonel hamilton smith who has written on this subject believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal speciesone of which the dun was striped and that the abovedescribed appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun stock but i am not at all satisfied with this theory and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian carthorse welch ponies cobs the lanky kattywar race c inhabiting the most distant parts of the world now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horsegenus rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs i once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra and mr w c martin in his excellent treatise on the horse has given a figure of a similar mule in four coloured drawings which i have seen of hybrids between the ass and zebra the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body and in one of them there was a double shoulderstripe in lord moretons famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga the hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black arabian sire were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga lastly and this is another most remarkable case a hybrid has been figured by dr gray and he informs me that he knows of a second case from the ass and the hemionus and this hybrid though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulderstripe nevertheless had all four legs barred and had three short shoulderstripes like those on the dun welch pony and even had some zebralike stripes on the sides of its face with respect to this last fact i was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an accident that i was led solely from the occurrence of the facestripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask colonel poole whether such facestripes ever occur in the eminently striped kattywar breed of horses and was as we have seen answered in the affirmative what now are we to say to these several facts we see several very distinct species of the horsegenus becoming by simple variation striped on the legs like a zebra or striped on the shoulders like an ass in the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appearsa tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus the appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character we see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons they are descended from a pigeon including two or three subspecies or geographical races of a bluish colour with certain bars and other marks and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint these bars and other marks invariably reappear but without any other change of form or character when the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels i have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters isthat there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the longlost character and that this tendency from unknown causes sometimes prevails and we have just seen that in several species of the horsegenus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old call the breeds of pigeons some of which have bred true for centuries species and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horsegenus for myself i venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations and i see an animal striped like a zebra but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed the common parent of our domestic horse whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks of the ass the hemionus quagga and zebra he who believes that each equine species was independently created will i presume assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary both under nature and under domestication in this particular manner so as often to become striped like other species of the genus and that each has been created with a strong tendency when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes not their own parents but other species of the genus to admit this view is as it seems to me to reject a real for an unreal or at least for an unknown cause it makes the works of god a mere mockery and deception i would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists that fossil shells had never lived but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the seashore summaryour ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs more or less from the same part in the parents but whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species and the greater differences between species of the same genus the external conditions of life as climate and food c seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects homologous parts tend to vary in the same way and homologous parts tend to cohere modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts when one part is largely developed perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual will be saved changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed and there are very many other correlations of growth the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand multiple parts are variable in number and in structure perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised to any particular function so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection it is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole organisation more specialised and are higher in the scale rudimentary organs from being useless will be disregarded by natural selection and hence probably are variable specific charactersthat is the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parentare more variable than generic characters or those which have long been inherited and have not differed within this same period in these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable because they have recently varied and thus come to differ but we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual for in a district where many species of any genus are foundthat is where there has been much former variation and differentiation or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at workthere on an average we now find most varieties or incipient species secondary sexual characters are highly variable and such characters differ much in the species of the same group variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species and specific differences to the several species of the same genus any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts for variation is a longcontinued and slow process and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state but when a species with any extraordinarilydeveloped organ has become the parent of many modified descendantswhich on my view must be a very slow process requiring a long lapse of timein this case natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous variation such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parentsand a cause for each must existit is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive chapter vi difficulties on theory difficulties on the theory of descent with modification transitions absence or rarity of transitional varieties transitions in habits of life diversified habits in the same species species with habits widely different from those of their allies organs of extreme perfection means of transition cases of difficulty natura non facit saltum organs of small importance organs not in all cases absolutely perfect the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced by the theory of natural selection long before having arrived at this part of my work a crowd of difficulties will have occurred to the reader some of them are so grave that to this day i can never reflect on them without being staggered but to the best of my judgment the greater number are only apparent and those that are real are not i think fatal to my theory these difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined secondly is it possible that an animal having for instance the structure and habits of a bat could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits can we believe that natural selection could produce on the one hand organs of trifling importance such as the tail of a giraffe which serves as a flyflapper and on the other hand organs of such wonderful structure as the eye of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection thirdly can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection what shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells which have practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians fourthly how can we account for species when crossed being sterile and producing sterile offspring whereas when varieties are crossed their fertility is unimpaired the two first heads shall be here discussedinstinct and hybridism in separate chapters on the absence or rarity of transitional varietiesas natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications each new form will tend in a fullystocked country to take the place of and finally to exterminate its own less improved parent or other lessfavoured forms with which it comes into competition thus extinction and natural selection will as we have seen go hand in hand hence if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form but as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth it will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record and i will here only state that i believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea whilst it slowly subsides these contingencies will concur only rarely and after enormously long intervals whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising or when very little sediment is being deposited there will be blanks in our geological history the crust of the earth is a vast museum but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote but it may be urged that when several closelyallied species inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms let us take a simple case in travelling from north to south over a continent we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land these representative species often meet and interlock and as the one becomes rarer and rarer the other becomes more and more frequent till the one replaces the other but if we compare these species where they intermingle they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each by my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent and during the process of modification each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states hence we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region though they must have existed there and may be embedded there in a fossil condition but in the intermediate region having intermediate conditions of life why do we not now find closelylinking intermediate varieties this difficulty for a long time quite confounded me but i think it can be in large part explained in the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring because an area is now continuous that it has been continuous during a long period geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones by changes in the form of the land and of climate marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present but i will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty for i believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas though i do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species more especially with freelycrossing and wandering animals in looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines and finally disappearing hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each we see the same fact in ascending mountains and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly as alph de candolle has observed a common alpine species disappears the same fact has been noticed by forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge to those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the allimportant elements of distribution these facts ought to cause surprise as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly but when we bear in mind that almost every species even in its metropolis would increase immensely in numbers were it not for other competing species that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others in short that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions but in large part on the presence of other species on which it depends or by which it is destroyed or with which it comes into competition and as these species are already defined objects however they may have become so not blending one into another by insensible gradations the range of any one species depending as it does on the range of others will tend to be sharply defined moreover each species on the confines of its range where it exists in lessened numbers will during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey or in the seasons be extremely liable to utter extermination and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined if i am right in believing that allied or representative species when inhabiting a continuous area are generally so distributed that each has a wide range with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer then as varieties do not essentially differ from species the same rule will probably apply to both and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone the intermediate variety consequently will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area and practically as far as i can make out this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature i have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between wellmarked varieties in the genus balanus and it would appear from information given me by mr watson dr asa gray and mr wollaston that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect now if we may trust these facts and inferences and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect then i think we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periodswhy as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear sooner than the forms which they originally linked together for any form existing in lesser numbers would as already remarked run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it but a far more important consideration as i believe is that during the process of further modification by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone for forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance within any given period of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers hence the more common forms in the race for life will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms for these will be more slowly modified and improved it is the same principle which as i believe accounts for the common species in each country as shown in the second chapter presenting on an average a greater number of wellmarked varieties than do the rarer species i may illustrate what i mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept one adapted to an extensive mountainous region a second to a comparatively narrow hilly tract and a third to wide plains at the base and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow hilly tract and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed and thus the two breeds which originally existed in greater numbers will come into close contact with each other without the interposition of the supplanted intermediate hillvariety to sum up i believe that species come to be tolerably welldefined objects and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links firstly because new varieties are very slowly formed for variation is a very slow process and natural selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants and such new places will depend on slow changes of climate or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants and probably in a still more important degree on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other so that in any one region and at any one time we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent and this assuredly we do see secondly areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period in isolated portions in which many forms more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species in this case intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection so that they will no longer exist in a living state thirdly when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area intermediate varieties will it is probable at first have been formed in the intermediate zones but they will generally have had a short duration for these intermediate varieties will from reasons already assigned namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species and likewise of acknowledged varieties exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect from this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination and during the process of further modification through natural selection they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect for these from existing in greater numbers will in the aggregate present more variation and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages lastly looking not to any one time but to all time if my theory be true numberless intermediate varieties linking most closely all the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed but the very process of natural selection constantly tends as has been so often remarked to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains which are preserved as we shall in a future chapter attempt to show in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structureit has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold how for instance a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted it would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits and as each exists by a struggle for life it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place in nature look at the mustela vison of north america which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur short legs and form of tail during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals if a different case had been taken and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat the question would have been far more difficult and i could have given no answer yet i think such difficulties have very little weight here as on other occasions i lie under a heavy disadvantage for out of the many striking cases which i have collected i can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species of the same genus and of diversified habits either constant or occasional in the same species and it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat look at the family of squirrels here we have the finest gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened and from others as sir j richardson has remarked with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full to the socalled flying squirrels and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree we cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey or to collect food more quickly or as there is reason to believe by lessening the danger from occasional falls but it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all natural conditions let the climate and vegetation change let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate or old ones become modified and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner therefore i can see no difficulty more especially under changing conditions of life in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flankmembranes each modification being useful each being propagated until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection a perfect socalled flying squirrel was produced now look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur which formerly was falsely ranked amongst bats it has an extremely wide flankmembrane stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail and including the limbs and the elongated fingers the flank membrane is also furnished with an extensor muscle although no graduated links of structure fitted for gliding through the air now connect the galeopithecus with the other lemuridæ yet i can see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed and that each had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels and that each grade of structure had been useful to its possessor nor can i see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membraneconnected fingers and forearm of the galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection and this as far as the organs of flight are concerned would convert it into a bat in bats which have the wingmembrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the tail including the hindlegs we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight if about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers like the loggerheaded duck micropterus of eyton as fins in the water and front legs on the land like the penguin as sails like the ostrich and functionally for no purpose like the apteryx yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it under the conditions of life to which it is exposed for each has to live by a struggle but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions it must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wingstructure here alluded to which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse indicate the natural steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight but they serve at least to show what diversified means of transition are possible seeing that a few members of such waterbreathing classes as the crustacea and mollusca are adapted to live on the land and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals flying insects of the most diversified types and formerly had flying reptiles it is conceivable that flyingfish which now glide far through the air slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins might have been modified into perfectly winged animals if this had been effected who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively as far as we know to escape being devoured by other fish when we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit as the wings of a bird for flight we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to exist to the present day for they will have been supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection furthermore we may conclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms thus to return to our imaginary illustration of the flyingfish it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms for taking prey of many kinds in many ways on the land and in the water until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less from their having existed in lesser numbers than in the case of species with fully developed structures i will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits in the individuals of the same species when either case occurs it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal by some modification of its structure for its changed habits or exclusively for one of its several different habits but it is difficult to tell and immaterial for us whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits both probably often change almost simultaneously of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many british insects which now feed on exotic plants or exclusively on artificial substances of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given i have often watched a tyrant flycatcher saurophagus sulphuratus in south america hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another like a kestrel and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water and then dashing like a kingfisher at a fish in our own country the larger titmouse parus major may be seen climbing branches almost like a creeper it often like a shrike kills small birds by blows on the head and i have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch and thus breaking them like a nuthatch in north america the black bear was seen by hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth thus catching like a whale insects in the water even in so extreme a case as this if the supply of insects were constant and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country i can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered by natural selection more and more aquatic in their structure and habits with larger and larger mouths till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale as we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely different from those both of their own species and of the other species of the same genus we might expect on my theory that such individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species having anomalous habits and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their proper type and such instances do occur in nature can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark yet in north america there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing and on the plains of la plata where not a tree grows there is a woodpecker which in every essential part of its organisation even in its colouring in the harsh tone of its voice and undulatory flight told me plainly of its close bloodrelationship to our common species yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree petrels are the most aërial and oceanic of birds yet in the quiet sounds of tierra del fuego the puffinuria berardi in its general habits in its astonishing power of diving its manner of swimming and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight would be mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe nevertheless it is essentially a petrel but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified on the other hand the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the waterouzel would never have suspected its subaquatic habits yet this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by divinggrasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under water he who believes that each being has been created as we now see it must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement what can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water and no one except audubon has seen the frigatebird which has all its four toes webbed alight on the surface of the sea on the other hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic although their toes are only bordered by membrane what seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants yet the waterhen is nearly as aquatic as the coot and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge in such cases and many others could be given habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure the webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function though not in structure in the frigatebird the deeplyscooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change he who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say that in these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of one type to take the place of one of another type but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language he who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers and that if any one being vary ever so little either in habits or structure and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the country it will seize on the place of that inhabitant however different it may be from its own place hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigatebirds with webbed feet either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting on the water that there should be longtoed corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps that there should be woodpeckers where not a tree grows that there should be diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks organs of extreme perfection and complicationto suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest possible degree yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real how a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated but i may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound in looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been perfected we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors but this is scarcely ever possible and we are forced in each case to look to species of the same group that is to the collateral descendants from the same original parentform in order to see what gradations are possible and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent in an unaltered or little altered condition amongst existing vertebrata we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head in this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages by which the eye has been perfected in the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and without any other mechanism and from this low stage numerous gradations of structure branching off in two fundamentally different lines can be shown to exist until we reach a moderately high stage of perfection in certain crustaceans for instance there is a double cornea the inner one divided into facets within each of which there is a lensshaped swelling in other crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment and which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light are convex at their upper ends and must act by convergence and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance with these facts here far too briefly and imperfectly given which show that there is much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans and bearing in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct i can see no very great difficulty not more than in the case of many other structures in believing that natural selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great articulate class he who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by the theory of descent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades his reason ought to conquer his imagination though i have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths it is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope we know that this instrument has been perfected by the longcontinued efforts of the highest human intellects and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process but may not this inference be presumptuous have we any right to assume that the creator works by intellectual powers like those of man if we must compare the eye to an optical instrument we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses placed at different distances from each other and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers and carefully selecting each alteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or in any degree tend to produce a distincter image we must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million and each to be preserved till a better be produced and then the old ones to be destroyed in living bodies variation will cause the slight alterations generation will multiply them almost infinitely and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement let this process go on for millions on millions of years and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass as the works of the creator are to those of man if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down but i can find out no such case no doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades more especially if we look to muchisolated species round which according to my theory there has been much extinction or again if we look to an organ common to all the members of a large class for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period since which all the many members of the class have been developed and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms long since become extinct we should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions thus the alimentary canal respires digests and excretes in the larva of the dragonfly and in the fish cobites in the hydra the animal may be turned inside out and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire in such cases natural selection might easily specialise if any advantage were thus gained a part or organ which had performed two functions for one function alone and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the same individual to give one instance there are fish with gills or branchiæ that breathe the air dissolved in the water at the same time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply and being divided by highly vascular partitions in these cases one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself being aided during the process of modification by the other organ and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose or be quite obliterated the illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose namely respiration the swimbladder has also been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish or for i do not know which view is now generally held a part of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or ideally similar in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung or organ used exclusively for respiration i can indeed hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype of which we know nothing furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder we can thus as i infer from professor owens interesting description of these parts understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea with some risk of falling into the lungs notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed in the higher vertebrata the branchiæ have wholly disappearedthe slits on the sides of the neck and the looplike course of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position but it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiæ might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose in the same manner as on the view entertained by some naturalists that the branchiæ and dorsal scales of annelids are homologous with the wings and wingcovers of insects it is probable that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of flight in considering transitions of organs it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another that i will give one more instance pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin called by me the ovigerous frena which serve through the means of a sticky secretion to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack these cirripedes have no branchiæ the whole surface of the body and sack including the small frena serving for respiration the balanidæ or sessile cirripedes on the other hand have no ovigerous frena the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack in the wellenclosed shell but they have large folded branchiæ now i think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchiæ of the other family indeed they graduate into each other therefore i do not doubt that little folds of skin which originally served as ovigerous frena but which likewise very slightly aided the act of respiration have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiæ simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct and they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes who would ever have imagined that the branchiæ in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations yet undoubtedly grave cases of difficulty occur some of which will be discussed in my future work one of the gravest is that of neuter insects which are often very differently constructed from either the males or fertile females but this case will be treated of in the next chapter the electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced but as owen and others have remarked their intimate structure closely resembles that of common muscle and as it has lately been shown that rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus and yet do not as matteuchi asserts discharge any electricity we must own that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible the electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty for they occur in only about a dozen fishes of which several are widely remote in their affinities generally when the same organ appears in several members of the same class especially if in members having very different habits of life we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse or natural selection but if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs which most of their modified descendants have lost the presence of luminous organs in a few insects belonging to different families and orders offers a parallel case of difficulty other cases could be given for instance in plants the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollengrains borne on a footstalk with a sticky gland at the end is the same in orchis and asclepiasgenera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering plants in all these cases of two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ it should be observed that although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected i am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention so natural selection working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state yet considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and unknown is very small i have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named towards which no transitional grade is known to lead the truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum we meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist or as milne edwards has well expressed it nature is prodigal in variety but niggard in innovation why on the theory of creation should this be so why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature be so invariably linked together by graduated steps why should not nature have taken a leap from structure to structure on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand why she should not for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations she can never take a leap but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps organs of little apparent importanceas natural selection acts by life and deathby the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structurei have sometimes felt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals i have sometimes felt as much difficulty though of a very different kind on this head as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye in the first place we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not in a former chapter i have given instances of most trifling characters such as the down on fruit and the colour of the flesh which from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences might assuredly be acted on by natural selection the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed flyflapper and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications each better and better for so trifling an object as driving away flies yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in south america absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a
