they may have been of contemporaneous origin and been subsequently upraised to the same height in the more northern parts of chile the tertiary strata seem to have been separately accumulated in bays now forming the mouths of valleys the relation between these several deposits on the shores of the pacific is not nearly so clear as in the case of the tertiary formations on the atlantic judging from the form and height of the land evidence which i feel sure is here much more trustworthy than it can be in such broken continents as that of europe from the identity of mineralogical composition from the presence of fragments of lignite and of silicified wood and from the intercalated layers of imperfect coal i must believe that the coastformations from central chiloe to concepcion a distance of miles are of the same age from nearly similar reasons i suspect that the beds of mocha huafo and ypun belong also to the same period the commonest shell in mocha and huafo is the same species of turritella and i believe the same cytheræa is found on the islands of huafo chiloe and ypun but with these trifling exceptions the few organic remains found at these places are distinct the numerous shells from navidad with the exception of two namely the sigaretus and turritella found at ypun are likewise distinct from those found in any other part of this coast coquimbo has cardium auca in common with concepcion and fusus cleryanus with huafo i may add that coquimbo has venus petitiana and a gigantic oyster said by m dorbigny also to be found a little south of concepcion in common with payta though this latter place is situated twentytwo degrees northward of lat to which point the coquimbo formation extends from these facts and from the generic resemblance of the fossils from the different localities i cannot avoid the suspicion that they all belong to nearly the same epoch which epoch as we shall immediately see must be a very ancient tertiary one but as the baculite especially considering its apparent identity with the cretaceous pondicherry species and the presence of an ammonite and the resemblance of the nautilus to two upper greensand species together afford very strong evidence that the formation at concepcion is a secondary one i will in my remarks on the fossils from the other localities put on one side those from concepcion and from eastern chiloe which whatever their age may be appear to me to belong to one group i must however again call attention to the fact that the cardium auca is found both at concepcion and in the undoubtedly tertiary strata of coquimbo nor should the possibility be overlooked that as trigonia though known in the northern hemisphere only as a secondary genus has living representatives in the australian seas so a baculite ammonite and trigonia may have survived in this remote part of the southern ocean to a somewhat later period than to the north of the equator before passing in review the fossils from the other localities there are two points with respect to the formations between concepcion and chiloe which deserve some notice first that though the strata are generally horizontal they have been upheaved in chiloe in a set of parallel anticlinal and uniclinal lines ranging north and southin the district near p rumena by eight or nine farextended most symmetrical uniclinal lines ranging nearly east and westand in the neighbourhood of concepcion by less regular single lines directed both ne and sw and nw and se this fact is of some interest as showing that within a period which cannot be considered as very ancient in relation to the history of the continent the strata between the cordillera and the pacific have been broken up in the same variouslydirected manner as have the old plutonic and metamorphic rocks in this same district the second point is that the sandstone between concepcion and southern chiloe is everywhere lignitiferous and includes much silicified wood whereas the formations in northern chile do not include beds of lignite or coal and in place of the fragments of silicified wood there are silicified bones now at the present day from cape horn to near concepcion the land is entirely concealed by forests which thin out at concepcion and in central and northern chile entirely disappear this coincidence in the distribution of the fossil wood and the living forests may be quite accidental but i incline to take a different view of it for as the difference in climate on which the presence of forests depends is here obviously in chief part due to the form of the land and as the cordillera undoubtedly existed when the lignitiferous beds were accumulating i conceive it is not improbable that the climate during the lignitiferous period varied on different parts of the coast in a somewhat similar manner as it now does looking to an earlier epoch when the strata of the cordillera were depositing there were islands which even in the latitude of northern chile where now all is irreclaimably desert supported large coniferous forests seventynine species of fossil shells in a tolerably recognisable condition from the coast of chile and peru are described in this volume and in the palæontological part of m dorbignys voyage if we put on one side the twenty species exclusively found at concepcion and chiloe fiftynine species from navidad and the other specified localities remain of these fiftynine species only an artemis a mytilus and balanus all from coquimbo are in the opinion of mr sowerby but not in that of m dorbigny identical with living shells and it would certainly require a better series of specimens to render this conclusion certain only the turritella chilensis from huafo and mocha the t patagonica and venus meridionalis from navidad come very near to recent south american shells namely the two turritellas to t cingulata and the venus to v exalbida some few other species come rather less near and some few resemble forms in the older european tertiary deposits none of the species resemble secondary forms hence i conceive there can be no doubt that these formations are tertiarya point necessary to consider after the case of concepcion the fiftynine species belong to thirtytwo genera of these gastridium is extinct and three or four of the genera viz panopæa rostellaria corbis and i believe solecurtus are not now found on the west coast of south america fifteen of the genera have on this coast living representatives in about the same latitudes with the fossil species but twelve genera now range very differently to what they formerly did when we consider that very few if any of the fiftynine fossil shells are identical with or make any close approach to living species when we consider that some of the genera do not now exist on the west coast of south america and that no less than twelve genera out of the thirtytwo formerly ranged very differently from the existing species of the same genera we must admit that these deposits are of considerable antiquity and that they probably verge on the commencement of the tertiary era may we not venture to believe that they are of nearly contemporaneous origin with the eocene formations of the northern hemisphere comparing the fossil remains from the coast of chile leaving out as before concepcion and chiloe with those from patagonia we may conclude from their generic resemblance and from the small number of the species which from either coast approach closely to living forms that the formations of both belong to nearly the same epoch and this is the opinion of m dorbigny had not a single fossil shell been common to the two coasts it could not have been argued that the formations belonged to different ages for messrs cuming and hinds have found on the comparison of nearly living species from the opposite sides of south america only one in common namely the purpura lapillus from both sides of the isthmus of panama even the shells collected by myself amongst the chonos islands and on the coast of patagonia are dissimilar and we must descend to the apex of the continent to tierra del fuego to find these two great conchological provinces united into one hence it is remarkable that four or five of the fossil shells from navidad namely voluta alta turritella patagonica trochus collaris venus meridionalis perhaps natica solida and perhaps the large oyster from coquimbo are considered by mr sowerby as identical with species from santa cruz and port desire m dorbigny however admits the perfect identity only of the trochus on the temperature of the tertiary periodas the number of the fossil species and genera from the western and eastern coasts is considerable it will be interesting to consider the probable nature of the climate under which they lived we will first take the case of navidad in lat where thirtyone species were collected and which as we shall presently see must have inhabited shallow water and therefore will necessarily well exhibit the effects of temperature referring to the table given in the previous page we find that the existing species of the genera cassis pyrula pleurotoma terebra and sigaretus which are generally though by no means invariably characteristic of warmer latitudes do not at the present day range nearly so far south on this line of coast as the fossil species formerly did including coquimbo we have perna in the same predicament the first impression from this fact is that the climate must formerly have been warmer than it now is but we must be very cautious in admitting this for cardium bulla and fusus and if we include coquimbo anomia and artemis likewise formerly ranged farther south than they now do and as these genera are far from being characteristic of hot climates their former greater southern range may well have been owing to causes quite distinct from climate voluta again though generally so tropical a genus is at present confined on the west coast to colder or more southern latitudes than it was during the tertiary period the trochus collaris moreover and as we have just seen according to mr sowerby two or three other species formerly ranged from navidad as far south as santa cruz in lat if instead of comparing the fossils of navidad as we have hitherto done with the shells now living on the west coast of south america we compare them with those found in other parts of the world under nearly similar latitudes for instance in the southern parts of the mediterranean or of australia there is no evidence that the sea off navidad was formerly hotter than what might have been expected from its latitude even if it was somewhat warmer than it now is when cooled by the great southern polar current several of the most tropical genera have no representative fossils at navidad and there are only single species of cassis pyrula and sigaretus two of pleurotoma and two of terebra but none of these species are of conspicuous size in patagonia there is even still less evidence in the character of the fossils of the climate having been formerly warmer as from the various reasons already assigned there can be little doubt that the formations of patagonia and at least of navidad and coquimbo in chile are the equivalents of an ancient stage in the tertiary formations of the northern hemisphere the conclusion that the climate of the southern seas at this period was not hotter than what might have been expected from the latitude of each place appears to me highly important for we must believe in accordance with the views of mr lyell that the causes which gave to the older tertiary productions of the quite temperate zones of europe a tropical character were of a local character and did not affect the entire globe on the other hand i have endeavoured to show in the geological transactions that at a much later period europe and north and south america were nearly contemporaneously subjected to iceaction and consequently to a colder or at least more equable climate than that now characteristic of the same latitudes on the absence of extensive modern conchiferous deposits in south america and on the contemporaneousness of the older tertiary deposits at distant points being due to contemporaneous movements of subsidenceknowing from the researches of professor e forbes that molluscous animals chiefly abound within a depth of fathoms and under and bearing in mind how many thousand miles of both coasts of south america have been upraised within the recent period by a slow longcontinued intermittent movementseeing the diversity in nature of the shores and the number of shells now living on themseeing also that the sea off patagonia and off many parts of chile was during the tertiary period highly favourable to the accumulation of sedimentthe absence of extensive deposits including recent shells over these vast spaces of coast is highly remarkable the conchiferous calcareous beds at coquimbo and at a few isolated points northward offer the most marked exception to this statement for these beds are from twenty to thirty feet in thickness and they stretch for some miles along shore attaining however only a very trifling breadth at valdivia there is some sandstone with imperfect casts of shells which possibly may belong to the recent period parts of the boulder formation and the shinglebeds on the lower plains of patagonia probably belong to this same period but neither are fossiliferous it also so happens that the great pampean formation does not include with the exception of the azara any mollusca there cannot be the smallest doubt that the upraised shells along the shores of the atlantic and pacific whether lying on the bare surface or embedded in mould or in sandhillocks will in the course of ages be destroyed by alluvial action this probably will be the case even with the calcareous beds of coquimbo so liable to dissolution by rainwater if we take into consideration the probability of oscillations of level and the consequent action of the tidal waves at different heights their destruction will appear almost certain looking to an epoch as far distant in futurity as we now are from the past miocene period there seems to me scarcely a chance under existing conditions of the numerous shells now living in those zones of depths most fertile in life and found exclusively on the western and southeastern coasts of south america being preserved to this imaginary distant epoch a whole conchological series will in time be swept away with no memorials of their existence preserved in the earths crust can any light be thrown on this remarkable absence of recent conchiferous deposits on these coasts on which at an ancient tertiary epoch strata abounding with organic remains were extensively accumulated i think there can namely by considering the conditions necessary for the preservation of a formation to a distant age looking to the enormous amount of denudation which on all sides of us has been effectedas evidenced by the lofty cliffs cutting off on so many coasts horizontal and once farextended strata of no great antiquity as in the case of patagoniaas evidenced by the level surface of the ground on both sides of great faults and dislocationsby inland lines of escarpments by outliers and numberless other facts and by that argument of high generality advanced by mr lyell namely that every sedimentary formation whatever its thickness may be and over however many hundred square miles it may extend is the result and the measure of an equal amount of wear and tear of preexisting formations considering these facts we must conclude that as an ordinary rule a formation to resist such vast destroying powers and to last to a distant epoch must be of wide extent and either in itself or together with superincumbent strata be of great thickness in this discussion we are considering only formations containing the remains of marine animals which as before mentioned live with some exceptions within most of them much within depths of a hundred fathoms how then can a thick and widely extended formation be accumulated which shall include such organic remains first let us take the case of the bed of the sea long remaining at a stationary level under these circumstances it is evident that conchiferous strata can accumulate only to the same thickness with the depth at which the shells can live on gently inclined coasts alone can they accumulate to any considerable width and from the want of superincumbent pressure it is probable that the sedimentary matter will seldom be much consolidated such formations have no very good chance when in the course of time they are upraised of long resisting the powers of denudation the chance will be less if the submarine surface instead of having remained stationary shall have gone on slowly rising during the deposition of the strata for in this case their total darkness must be less and each part before being consolidated or thickly covered up by superincumbent matter will have had successively to pass through the ordeal of the beach and on most coasts the waves on the beach tend to wear down and disperse every object exposed to their action now both on the southeastern and western shores of south america we have had clear proofs that the land has been slowly rising and in the long lines of lofty cliffs we have seen that the tendency of the sea is almost everywhere to eat into the land considering these facts it ceases i think to be surprising that extensive recent conchiferous deposits are entirely absent on the southern and western shores of america let us take the one remaining case of the bed of the sea slowly subsiding during a length of time whilst sediment has gone on being deposited it is evident that strata might thus accumulate to any thickness each stratum being deposited in shallow water and consequently abounding with those shells which cannot live at great depths the pressure also i may observe of each fresh bed would aid in consolidating all the lower ones even on a rather steep coast though such must ever be unfavourable to widely extended deposits the formations would always tend to increase in breadth from the water encroaching on the land hence we may admit that periods of slow subsidence will commonly be most favourable to the accumulation of conchiferous deposits of sufficient thickness extension and hardness to resist the average powers of denudation we have seen thàt at an ancient tertiary epoch fossiliferous deposits were extensively deposited on the coasts of south america and it is a very interesting fact that there is evidence that these ancient tertiary beds were deposited during a period of subsidence thus at navidad the strata are about feet in thickness and the fossil shells are abundant both at the level of the sea and some way up the cliffs having sent a list of these fossils to professor e forbes he thinks they must have lived in water between one and ten fathoms in depth hence the bottom of the sea on which these shells once lived must have subsided at least feet to allow of the superincumbent matter being deposited i must here remark that as all these and the following fossil shells are extinct species professor forbes necessarily judges of the depths at which they lived only from their generic character and from the analogical distribution of shells in the northern hemisphere but there is no just cause from this to doubt the general results at huafo the strata are about the same thickness namely feet and professor forbes thinks the fossils found there cannot have lived at a greater depth than fifty fathoms or feet these two points namely navidad and huafo are miles apart but nearly halfway between them lies mocha an island feet in height apparently formed of tertiary strata up to its level summit and with many shells including the same turritella with that found at huafo embedded close to the level of the sea in patagonia shells are numerous at st cruz at the foot of the feet plain which has certainly been formed by the denudation of the feet plain and therefore was originally covered by strata that number of feet in thickness and these shells according to professor forbes probably lived at a depth of between seven and fifteen fathoms at port st julian sixty miles to the north shells are numerous at the foot of the ninety feet plain formed by the denudation of the feet plain and likewise occasionally at the height of several hundred feet in the upper strata these shells must have lived in water somewhere between five and fifty fathoms in depth although in other parts of patagonia i have no direct evidence of shoalwater shells having been buried under a great thickness of superincumbent submarine strata yet it should be borne in mind that the lower fossiliferous strata with several of the same species of mollusca the upper tufaceous beds and the high summitplain stretch for a considerable distance southward and for hundreds of miles northward seeing this uniformity of structure i conceive it may be fairly concluded that the subsidence by which the shells at santa cruz and st julian were carried down and covered up was not confined to these two points but was coextensive with a considerable portion of the patagonian tertiary formation in a succeeding chapter it will be seen that we are led to a similar conclusion with respect to the secondary fossiliferous strata of the cordillera namely that they also were deposited during a longcontinued and great period of subsidence from the foregoing reasoning and from the facts just given i think we must admit the probability of the following proposition namely that when the bed of the sea is either stationary or rising circumstances are far less favourable than when the level is sinking to the accumulation of conchiferous deposits of sufficient thickness and extension to resist when upheaved the average vast amount of denudation this result appears to me in several respects very interesting everyone is at first inclined to believe that at innumerable points wherever there is a supply of sediment fossiliferous strata are now forming which at some future distant epoch will be upheaved and preserved but on the views above given we must conclude that this is far from being the case on the contrary we require st a longcontinued supply of sediment nd an extensive shallow area and rd that this area shall slowly subside to a great depth so as to admit the accumulation of a widelyextended thick mass of superincumbent strata in how few parts of the world probably do these conditions at the present day concur we can thus also understand the general want of that close sequence in fossiliferous formations which we might theoretically have anticipated for without we suppose a subsiding movement to go on at the same spot during an enormous period from one geological era to another and during the whole of this period sediment to accumulate at the proper rate so that the depth should not become too great for the continued existence of molluscous animals it is scarcely possible that there should be a perfect sequence at the same spot in the fossil shells of the two geological formations so far from a very longcontinued subsidence being probable many facts lead to the belief that the earths surface oscillates up and down and we have seen that during the elevatory movements there is but a small chance of durable fossiliferous deposits accumulating lastly these same considerations appear to throw some light on the fact that certain periods appear to have been favourable to the deposition or at least to the preservation of contemporaneous formations at very distant points we have seen that in south america an enormous area has been rising within the recent period and in other quarters of the globe immense spaces appear to have risen contemporaneously from my examination of the coralreefs of the great oceans i have been led to conclude that the bed of the sea has gone on slowly sinking within the present era over truly vast areas this indeed is in itself probable from the simple fact of the rising areas having been so large in south america we have distinct evidence that at nearly the same tertiary period the bed of the sea off parts of the coast of chile and off patagonia was sinking though these regions are very remote from each other if then it holds good as a general rule that in the same quarter of the globe the earths crust tends to sink and rise contemporaneously over vast spaces we can at once see that we have at distant points at the same period those very conditions which appear to be requisite for the accumulation of fossiliferous masses of sufficient extension thickness and hardness to resist denudation and consequently to last unto an epoch distant in futurity chapter xiii

or of some special interest will be described in detail at the end of the chapter i will sum up all the facts on cleavage and foliationto which i particularly attended bahia brazil lat souththe prevailing rock is gneiss often passing by the disappearance of the quartz and mica and by the feldspar losing its red colour into a brilliantly grey primitive greenstone not unfrequently quartz and hornblende are arranged in layers in almost amorphous feldspar there is some finegrained syenitic granite orbicularly marked by ferruginous lines and weathering into vertical cylindrical holes almost touching each other in the gneiss concretions of granular feldspar and other of garnets with mica occur the gneiss is traversed by numerous dikes composed of black finely crystallised hornblendic rock containing a little glassy feldspar and sometimes mica and varying in thickness from mere threads to ten feet these threads which are often curvilinear could sometimes be traced running into the larger dikes one of these dikes was remarkable from having been in two or three places laterally disjointed with unbroken gneiss interposed between the broken ends and in one part with a portion of the gneiss driven apparently whilst in a softened state into its side or wall in several neighbouring places the gneiss included angular welldefined sometimes bent masses of hornblende rock quite like except in being more perfectly crystallised that forming the dikes and at least in one instance containing as determined by professor miller augite as well as hornblende in one or two cases these angular masses though now quite separate from each other by the solid gneiss had from their exact correspondence in size and shape evidently once been united hence i cannot doubt that most or all of the fragments have been derived from the breaking up of the dikes of which we see the first stage in the abovementioned laterally disjointed one the gneiss close to the fragments generally contained many large crystals of hornblende which are entirely absent or rare in other parts its folia or laminæ were gently bent round the fragments in the same manner as they sometimes are round concretions hence the gneiss has certainly been softened its composition modified and its folia arranged subsequently to the breaking up of the dikes these latter also having been at the same time bent and softened i must here take the opportunity of premising that by the term cleavage i imply those planes of division which render a rock appearing to the eye quite or nearly homogeneous fissile by the term foliation i refer to the layers or plates of different mineralogical nature of which most metamorphic schists are composed there are also often included in such masses alternating homogeneous fissile layers or folia and in this case the rock is both foliated and has a cleavage by stratification as applied to these formations i mean those alternate parallel large masses of different composition which are themselves frequently either foliated or fissilesuch as the alternating socalled strata of micaslate gneiss glossy clayslate and marble the folia of the gneiss within a few miles round bahia generally strike irregularly and are often curvilinear dipping in all directions at various angles but where best defined they extended most frequently in a ne by n or east n and sw by s line corresponding nearly with the coastline northwards of the bay i may add that mr gardner found in several parts of the province of ceara which lies between and miles north of bahia gneiss with the folia extending e n and in guyana according to sir r schomburgk the same rock strikes e n again humboldt describes the gneissgranite over an immense area in venezuela and even in colombia as striking e n and dipping to the nw at an angle of fifty degrees hence all the observations hitherto made tend to show that the gneissic rocks over the whole of this part of the continent have their folia extending generally within almost a point of the compass of the same direction rio de janeirothis whole district is almost exclusively formed of gneiss abounding with garnets and porphyritic with large crystals even three and four inches in length of orthoclase feldspar in these crystals mica and garnets are often enclosed at the western base of the corcovado there is some ferruginous carious quartzrock and in the tijeuka range much finegrained granite i observed boulders of greenstone in several places and on the islet of villegagnon and likewise on the coast some miles northward two large trappean dikes the porphyritic gneiss or gneissgranite as it has been called by humboldt is only so far foliated that the constituent minerals are arranged with a certain degree of regularity and may be said to have a grain but they are not separated into distinct folia or laminæ there are however several other varieties of gneiss regularly foliated and alternating with each other in socalled strata the stratification and foliation of the ordinary gneisses and the foliation or grain of the gneissgranite are parallel to each other and generally strike within a point of ne and sw dipping at a high angle between and generally to se so that here again we meet with the strike so prevalent over the more northern parts of this continent the mountains of gneissgranite are to a remarkable degree abruptly conical which seems caused by the rock tending to exfoliate in thick conically concentric layers these peaks resemble in shape those of phonolite and other injected rocks on volcanic islands nor is the grain or foliation as we shall afterwards see any difficulty on the idea of the gneissgranite having been an intrusive rather than a metamorphic formation the lines of mountains but not always each separate hill range nearly in the same direction with the foliation and socalled stratification but rather more easterly on a bare gently inclined surface of the porphyritic gneiss in botofogo bay i observed the appearance here represented a fragment seven yards long and two in width with angular and distinctly defined edges composed of a peculiar variety of gneiss with dark layers of mica and garnets is surrounded on all sides by the ordinary gneissgranite both having been dislocated by a granitic vein the folia in the fragment and in the surrounding rock strike in the same nne and ssw line but in the fragment they are vertical whereas in the gneissgranite they dip at a small angle as shown by the arrows to sse this fragment considering its great size its solitary position and its foliated structure parallel to that of the surrounding rock is as far as i know a unique case and i will not attempt any explanation of its origin the numerous travellers in this country have all been greatly surprised at the depth to which the gneiss and other granitic rocks as well as the talcose slates of the interior have been decomposed near rio every mineral except the quartz has been completely softened in some places to a depth little less than one hundred feet the minerals retain their positions in folia ranging in the usual direction and fractured quartz veins may be traced from the solid rock running for some distance into the softened mottled highly coloured argillaceous mass it is said that these decomposed rocks abound with gems of various kinds often in a fractured state owing as some have supposed to the collapse of geodes and that they contain gold and diamonds at rio it appeared to me that the gneiss had been softened before the excavation no doubt by the sea of the existing broad flatbottomed valleys for the depth of decomposition did not appear at all conformable with the present undulations of the surface the porphyritic gneiss where now exposed to the air seems to with stand decomposition remarkably well and i could see no signs of any tendency to the production of argillaceous masses like those here described i was also struck with the fact that where a bare surface of this rock sloped into one of the quiet bays there were no marks of erosion at the level of the water and the parts both beneath and above it preserved a uniform curve at bahia the gneiss rocks are similarly decomposed with the upper parts insensibly losing their foliation and passing without any distinct line of separation into a bright red argillaceous earth including partially rounded fragments of quartz and granite from this circumstance and from the rocks appearing to have suffered decomposition before the excavation of the valleys i suspect that here as at rio the decomposition took place under the sea the subject appeared to me a curious one and would probably well repay careful examination by an able mineralogist the northern provinces of la plataaccording to some observations communicated to me by mr fox the coast from rio de janeiro to the mouth of the plata seems everywhere to be granitic with a few trappean dikes at port alegre near the boundary of brazil there are porphyries and diorites at the mouth of the plata i examined the country for twentyfive miles west and for about seventy miles north of maldonado near this town there is some common gneiss and much in all parts of the country of a coarsegrained mixture of quartz and reddish feldspar often however assuming a little darkgreen imperfect hornblende and then immediately becoming foliated the abrupt hillocks thus composed as well as the highly inclined folia of the common varieties of gneiss strike nne or a little more easterly and ssw clayslate is occasionally met with and near the l del potrero there is white marble rendered fissile from the presence of hornblende mica and asbestus the cleavage of these rocks and their stratification that is the alternating masses thus composed strike nne and ssw like the foliated gneisses and have an almost vertical dip the sierra larga a low range five miles west of maldonado consists of quartzite often ferruginous having an arenaceous feel and divided into excessively thin almost vertical laminæ or folia by microscopically minute scales apparently of mica and striking in the usual nne and ssw direction the range itself is formed of one principal line with some subordinate ones and it extends with remarkable uniformity far northward it is said even to the confines of brazil in the same line with the vertically ribboned quartz rock of which it is composed the s de las animas is the highest range in the country i estimated it at feet it runs north and south and is formed of feldspathic porphyry near its base there is a nnw and sse ridge of a conglomerate in a highly porphyritic basis northward of maldonado and south of las minas there is an e and w hilly band of country some miles in width formed of siliceous clayslate with some quartz rock and limestone having a tortuous irregular cleavage generally ranging east and west e and se of las minas there is a confused district of imperfect gneiss and laminated quartz with the hills ranging in various directions but with each separate hill generally running in the same line with the folia of the rocks of which it is composed this confusion appears to have been caused by the intersection of the e and w and nne and ssw strikes northward of las minas the more regular northerly ranges predominate from this place to near polanco we meet with the coarsegrained mixture of quartz and feldspar often with the imperfect hornblende and then becoming foliated in a n and s linewith imperfect clayslate including laminæ of red crystallised feldsparwith white or black marble sometimes containing asbestus and crystals of gypsumwith quartzrockwith syeniteand lastly with much granite the marble and granite alternate repeatedly in apparently vertical masses some miles north ward of the polanco a wide district is said to be entirely composed of marble it is remarkable how rare mica is in the whole range of country north and westward of maldonado throughout this district the cleavage of the clayslate and marblethe foliation of the gneiss and the quartzthe stratification or alternating masses of these several rocksand the range of the hills all coincide in direction and although the country is only hilly the planes of division are almost everywhere very highly inclined or vertical some ancient submarine volcanic rocks are worth mentioning from their rarity on this eastern side of the continent in the valley of the tapas fifty or sixty miles n of maldonado there is a tract three or four miles in length composed of various trappean rocks with glassy feldsparof apparently metamorphosed gritstonesof purplish amygdaloids with large kernels of carbonate of limeand much of a harshish rock with glassy feldspar intermediate in character between claystone porphyry and trachyte this latter rock was in one spot remarkable from being full of drusy cavities lined with quartz crystals and arranged in planes dipping at an angle of to the east and striking parallel to the foliation of an adjoining hill composed of the common mixture of quartz feldspar and imperfect hornblende this fact perhaps indicates that these volcanic rocks have been metamorphosed and their constituent parts rearranged at the same time and according to the same laws with the granitic and metamorphic formations of this whole region in the valley of the marmaraya a few miles south of the tapas a band of trappean and amygdaloidal rock is interposed between a hill of granite and an extensive surrounding formation of red conglomerate which like that at the foot of the s animas has its basis porphyritic with crystals of feldspar and which hence has certainly suffered metamorphosis monte videothe rocks here consist of several varieties of gneiss with the feldspar often yellowish granular and imperfectly crystallised alternating with and passing insensibly into beds from a few yards to nearly a mile in thickness of fine or coarse grained darkgreen hornblendic slate this again often passing into chloritic schist these passages seem chiefly due to changes in the mica and its replacement by other minerals at rat island i examined a mass of chloritic schist only a few yards square irregularly surrounded on all sides by the gneiss and intricately penetrated by many curvilinear veins of quartz which gradually blend into the gneiss the cleavage of the chloritic schist and the foliation of the gneiss were exactly parallel eastward of the city there is much finegrained darkcoloured gneiss almost assuming the character of hornblendeslate which alternates in thin laminæ with laminæ of quartz the whole mass being transversely intersected by numerous large veins of quartz i particularly observed that these veins were absolutely continuous with the alternating laminæ of quartz in this case and at rat island the passage of the gneiss into imperfect hornblendic or into chloritic slate seemed to be connected with the segregation of the veins of quartz the mount a hill believed to be feet in height from which the place takes its name is much the highest land in this neighbourhood it consists of hornblendic slate which except on the eastern and disturbed base has an east and west nearly vertical cleavage the longer axis of the hill also ranges in this same line near the summit the hornblendeslate gradually becomes more and more coarsely crystallised and less plainly laminated until it passes into a heavy sonorous greenstone with a slaty conchoidal fracture the laminæ on the north and south sides near the summit dip inwards as if this upper part had expanded or bulged outwards this greenstone must i conceive be considered as metamorphosed hornblendeslate the cerrito the next highest but much less elevated point is almost similarly composed in the more western parts of the province besides gneiss there is quartzrock syenite and granite and at colla i heard of marble near m video the space which i more accurately examined was about fifteen miles in an east and west line and here i found the foliation of the gneiss and the cleavage of the slates generally well developed and extending parallel to the alternating strata composed of the gneiss hornblendic and chloritic schists these planes of division all range within one point of east and west frequently east by south and west by north their dip is generally almost vertical and scarcely anywhere under this fact considering how slightly undulatory the surface of the country is deserves attention westward of m video towards the uruguay wherever the gneiss is exposed the highly inclined folia are seen striking in the same direction i must except one spot where the strike was nw by w the little sierra de s juan formed of gneiss and laminated quartz must also be excepted for it ranges between n to ne and s to sw and seems to belong to the same system with the hills in the maldonado district finally we have seen that for many miles northward of maldonado and for twentyfive miles westward of it as far as the s de las animas the foliation cleavage socalled stratification and lines of hills all ranges nne and ssw which is nearly coincident with the adjoining coast of the atlantic westward of the s de las animas as far as even the uruguay the foliation cleavage and stratification but not lines of hills for there are no defined ones all range about e by s and w by n which is nearly coincident with the direction of the northern shore of the plata in the confused country near las minas where these two great systems appear to intersect each other the cleavage foliation and stratification run in various directions but generally coincide with the line of each separate hill southern la platathe first ridge south of the plata which projects through the pampean formation is the sierra tapalguen and vulcan situated miles southward of the district just described this ridge is only a few hundred feet in height and runs from c corrientes in a wnw line for at least miles into the interior at tapalguen it is composed of unstratified granular quartz remarkable from forming tabular masses and small plains surrounded by precipitous cliffs other parts of the range are said to consist of granite and marble is found at the s tinta it appears from m parchappes observations that at tandil there is a range of quartzose gneiss very like the rocks of the s larga near maldonado running in the same nne and ssw direction so that the framework of the country here is very similar to that on the northern shore of the plata the sierra guitrugueyu is situated sixty miles south of the s tapalguen it consists of numerous parallel sometimes blended together ridges about twentythree miles in width and feet in height above the plain and extending in a nw and se direction skirting round the extreme se termination i ascended only a few points which were composed of a finegrained gneiss almost composed of feldspar with a little mica and passing in the upper parts of the hills into a rather compact purplishclay state the cleavage was nearly vertical striking in a nw by w and se by e line nearly though not quite coincident with the direction of the parallel ridges the sierra ventana lies close south of that of guitrugueyu it is remarkable from attaining a height very unusual on this side of the continent of feet it consists up to its summit of quartz generally pure and white but sometimes reddish and divided into thick laminæ or strata in one part there is a little glossy clayslate with a tortuous cleavage the thick layers of quartz strike in a w n line dipping southerly at an angle of and upwards the principal line of mountains with some quite subordinate parallel ridges range about w n but at their se termination only w n this sierra is said to extend between twenty and thirty leagues into the interior patagoniawith the exception perhaps of the hill of s antonio feet high in the gulf of s matias which has never been visited by a geologist crystalline rocks are not met with on the coast of patagonia for a space of miles south of the s ventana at this point lat at points union and tombo plutonic rocks are said to appear and are found at rather wide intervals beneath the patagonian tertiary formation for a space of about miles southward to near bird island in lat judging from specimens kindly collected for me by mr stokes the prevailing rock at ports st elena camerones malaspina and as far south as the paps of pineda is a purplishpink or brownish claystone porphyry sometimes laminated sometimes slightly vesicular with crystals of opaque feldspar and with a few grains of quartz hence these porphyries resemble those immediately to be described at port desire and likewise a series which i have seen from p alegre on the southern confines of brazil this porphyritic formation further resembles in a singularly close manner the lowest stratified formation of the cordillera of chile which as we shall hereafter see has a vast range and attains a great thickness at the bottom of the gulf of st george only tertiary deposits appear to be present at cape blanco there is quartz rock very like that of the falkland islands and some hard blue siliceous clayslate at port desire there is an extensive formation of the claystone porphyry stretching at least twentyfive miles into the interior it has been denuded and deeply worn into gullies before being covered up by the tertiary deposits through which it here and there projects in hills those north of the bay being feet in height the strata have in several places been tilted at small angles generally either to nnw or sse by gradual passages and alternations the porphyries change incessantly in nature i will describe only some of the principal mineralogical changes which are highly instructive and which i carefully examined the prevailing rock has a compact purplish base with crystals of earthy or opaque feldspar and often with grains of quartz there are other varieties with an almost truly trachytic base full of little angular vesicles and crystals of glassy feldspar and there are beds of black perfect pitchstone as well as of a concretionary imperfect variety on a casual inspection the whole series would be thought to be of the same plutonic or volcanic nature with the trachytic varieties and pitchstone but this is far from being the case as much of the porphyry is certainly of metamorphic origin besides the true porphyries there are many beds of earthy quite white or yellowish friable easily fusible matter resembling chalk which under the microscope is seen to consist of minute broken crystals and which as remarked in a former chapter singularly resembles the upper tufaceous beds of the patagonian tertiary formation this earthy substance often becomes coarser and contains minute rounded fragments of porphyries and rounded grains of quartz and in one case so many of the latter as to resemble a common sandstone these beds are sometimes marked with true lines of aqueous deposition separating particles of different degrees of coarseness in other cases there are parallel ferruginous lines not of true deposition as shown by the arrangement of the particles though singularly resembling them the more indurated varieties often include many small and some larger angular cavities which appear due to the removal of earthy matter some varieties contain mica all these earthy and generally white stones insensibly pass into more indurated sonorous varieties breaking with a conchoidal fracture yet of small specific gravity many of these latter varieties assume a pale purple tint being singularly banded and veined with different shades and often become plainly porphyritic with crystals of feldspar the formation of these crystals could be most clearly traced by minute angular and often partially hollow patches of earthy matter first assuming a fibrous structure then passing into opaque imperfectly shaped crystals and lastly into perfect glassy crystals when these crystals have appeared and when the basis has become compact the rock in many places could not be distinguished from a true claystone porphyry without a trace of mechanical structure in some parts these earthy or tufaceous beds pass into jaspery and into beautifully mottled and banded porcelain rocks which break into splinters translucent at their edges hard enough to scratch glass and fusible into white transparent beads grains of quartz included in the porcelainous varieties can be seen melting into the surrounding paste in other parts the earthy or tufaceous beds either insensibly pass into or alternate with breccias composed of large and small fragments of various purplish porphyries with the matrix generally porphyritic these breccias though their subaqueous origin is in many places shown both by the arrangement of their smaller particles and by an oblique or current lamination also pass into porphyries in which every trace of mechanical origin and stratification has been obliterated some highly porphyritic though coarsegrained masses evidently of sedimentary origin and divided into thin layers differing from each other chiefly in the number of embedded grains of quartz interested me much from the peculiar manner in which here and there some of the layers terminated in abrupt points quite unlike those produced by a layer of sediment naturally thinning out and apparently the result of a subsequent process of metamorphic aggregation in another common variety of a finer texture the aggregating process had gone further for the whole mass consisted of quite short parallel often slightly curved layers or patches of whitish or reddish finely granulocrystalline feldspathic matter generally terminating at both ends in blunt points these layers or patches further tended to pass into wedge or almond shaped little masses and these finally into true crystals of feldspar with their centres often slightly drusy the series was so perfect that i could not doubt that these large crystals which had their longer axes placed parallel to each other had primarily originated in the metamorphosis and aggregation of alternating layers of tuff and hence their parallel position must be attributed unexpected though the conclusion may be not to laws of chemical action but to the original planes of deposition i am tempted briefly to describe three other singular allied varieties of rock the first without examination would have passed for a stratified porphyritic breccia but all the included angular fragments consisted of a border of pinkish crystalline feldspathic matter surrounding a dark translucent siliceous centre in which grains of quartz not quite blended into the paste could be distinguished this uniformity in the nature of the fragments shows that they are not of mechanical but of concretionary origin having resulted perhaps from the selfbreaking up and aggregation of layers of indurated tuff containing numerous grains of quartzinto which indeed the whole mass in one part passed the second variety is a reddish nonporphyritic claystone quite full of spherical cavities about half an inch in diameter each lined with a collapsed crust formed of crystals of quartz the third variety also consists of a pale purple nonporphyritic claystone almost wholly formed of concretionary balls obscurely arranged in layers of a less compact and paler coloured claystone each ball being on one side partly hollow and lined with crystals of quartz pseudodikessome miles up the harbour in a line of cliffs formed of slightly metamorphosed tufaceous and porphyritic claystone beds i observed three vertical dikes so closely resembling in general appearance ordinary volcanic dikes that i did not doubt until closely examining their composition that they had been injected from below the first is straight with parallel sides and about four feet wide it consists of whitish indurated tufaceous matter precisely like some of the beds intersected by it the second dike is more remarkable it is slightly tortuous about eighteen inches thick and can be traced for a considerable distance along the beach it is of a purplishred or brown colour and is formed chiefly of rounded grains of quartz with broken crystals of earthy feldspar scales of black mica and minute fragments of claystone porphyry all firmly united together in a hard sparing base the structure of this dike shows obviously that it is of mechanical and sedimentary origin yet it thinned out upwards and did not cut through the uppermost strata in the cliffs this fact at first appears to indicate that the matter could not have been washed in from above but if we reflect on the suction which would result from a deepseated fissure being formed we may admit that if the fissure were in any part open to the surface mud and water might well be drawn into it along its whole course the third dike consisted of a hard rough white rock almost composed of broken crystals of glassy feldspar with numerous scales of black mica cemented in a scanty base there was little in the appearance of this rock to preclude the idea of its having been a true injected feldspathic dike the matter composing these three pseudodikes especially the second one appears to have suffered like the surrounding strata a certain degree of metamorphic action and this has much aided the deceptive appearance at bahia in brazil we have seen that a true injected hornblendic dike not only has suffered metamorphosis but has been dislocated and even diffused in the surrounding gneiss under the form of separate crystals and of fragments falkland islandsi have described these islands in a paper published in the third volume of the geological journal the mountainridges consist of quartz and the lower country of clayslate and sandstone the latter containing palæozoic fossils these fossils have been separately described by messrs morris and sharpe some of them resemble silurian and others devonian forms in the eastern part of the group the several parallel ridges of quartz extend in a west and east line but farther westward the line becomes wnw and ese and even still more northerly the cleavageplanes of the clayslate are highly inclined generally at an angle of above and often vertical they strike almost invariably in the same direction with the quartz ranges the outline of the indented shores of the two main islands and the relative positions of the smaller islets accord with the strike both of the main axes of elevation and of the cleavage of the clayslate tierra del fuegomy notes on the geology of this country are copious but as they are unimportant and as fossils were found only in one district a brief sketch will be here sufficient the east coast from the straits of magellan where the boulder formation is largely developed to st polycarps bay is formed of horizontal tertiary strata bounded some way towards the interior by a broad mountainous band of clayslate this great clayslate formation extends from st le maire westward for miles along both sides of the beagle channel to near its bifurcation south of this channel it forms all navarin island and the eastern half of hoste island and of hardy peninsula north of the beagle channel it extends in a northwest line on both sides of admiralty sound to brunswick peninsula in the straits of magellan and i have reason to believe stretches far up the eastern side of the cordillera the western and broken side of tierra del fuego towards the pacific is formed of metamorphic schists granite and various trappean rocks the line of separation between the crystalline and clayslate formations can generally be distinguished as remarked by captain king by the parallelism in the clayslate districts of the shores and channels ranging in a line between w to n and e to s the clayslate is generally fissile sometimes siliceous or ferruginous with veins of quartz and calcareous spar it often assumes especially on the loftier mountains an altered feldspathic character passing into feldspathic porphyry occasionally it is associated with breccia and grauwacke at good success bay there is a little intercalated black crystalline limestone at port famine much of the clayslate is calcareous and passes either into a mudstone or into grauwacke including oddshaped concretions of dark argillaceous limestone here alone on the shore a few miles north of port famine and on the summit of mount tarn feet high i found organic remains m dorbigny states that mm hombron and grange found in this neighbourhood an ancyloceras perhaps a simplex an ammonite a plicatula and modiola m dorbigny believes from the general character of these fossils and from the ancyloceras being identical as far as its imperfect condition allows of comparison with the a simplex of europe that the formation belongs to an early stage of the cretaceous system professor e forbes judging only from my specimens concurs in the probability of this conclusion the hamites elatior of the above list of which a description is given by mr sowerby in the appendix and which is remarkable from its large size has not been seen either by m dorbigny or professor e forbes as since my return to england the specimens have been lost the great clayslate formation of tierra del fuego being cretaceous is certainly a very interesting factwhether we consider the appearance of the country which without the evidence afforded by the fossils would form the analogy of most known districts probably have been considered as belonging to the palæozoic seriesor whether we view it as showing that the age of this terminal portion of the great axis of south america is the same as will hereafter be seen with the cordillera of chile and peru the clayslate in many parts of tierra del fuego is broken by dikes and by great masses of greenstone often highly hornblendic almost all the small islets within the
