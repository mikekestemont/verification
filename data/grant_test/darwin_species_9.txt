used as the father or the mother there is generally some difference and occasionally the widest possible difference in the facility of effecting an union the hybrids moreover produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature i think not for why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree when various species are crossed all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids and other species cross with extreme difficulty and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species why it may even be asked has the production of hybrids been permitted to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents seems to be a strange arrangement the foregoing rules and facts on the other hand appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences chiefly in the reproductive systems of the species which are crossed the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature that in reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other but not in a reversed direction it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences and not a specially endowed quality as the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature i presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants we can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth in the hardness of their wood in the period of the flow or nature of their sap c but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever great diversity in the size of two plants one being woody and the other herbaceous one being evergreen and the other deciduous and adaptation to widely different climates does not always prevent the two grafting together as in hybridisation so with grafting the capacity is limited by systematic affinity for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families and on the other hand closely allied species and varieties of the same species can usually but not invariably be grafted with ease but this capacity as in hybridisation is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other the pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince which is ranked as a distinct genus than on the apple which is a member of the same genus even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum as gärtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing so sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together as in reciprocal crosses the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal so it sometimes is in grafting the common gooseberry for instance cannot be grafted on the currant whereas the currant will take though with difficulty on the gooseberry we have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition is a very different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species which have their reproductive organs perfect yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent parallel something analogous occurs in grafting for thouin found that three species of robinia which seeded freely on their own roots and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on another species when thus grafted were rendered barren on the other hand certain species of sorbus when grafted on other species yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots we are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of hippeastrum lobelia c which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of distinct species than when selffertilised with their own pollen we thus see that although there is a clear and fundamental difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species and as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems so i believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences chiefly in their reproductive systems these differences in both cases follow to a certain extent as might have been expected systematic affinity by which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed the facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been a special endowment although in the case of crossing the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybridswe may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids these two cases are fundamentally different for as just remarked in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect whereas in hybrids they are imperfect even in first crosses the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes there must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollentubes to reach the ovarium it has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species though the pollentubes protrude they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface again the male element may reach the female element but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed as seems to have been the case with some of thurets experiments on fuci no explanation can be given of these facts any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others lastly an embryo may be developed and then perish at an early period this latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to but i believe from observations communicated to me by mr hewitt who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses i was at first very unwilling to believe in this view as hybrids when once born are generally healthy and longlived as we see in the case of the common mule hybrids however are differently circumstanced before and after birth when born and living in a country where their two parents can live they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life but a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother and therefore before birth as long as it is nourished within its mothers womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable and consequently be liable to perish at an early period more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life in regard to the sterility of hybrids in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed the case is very different i have more than once alluded to a large body of facts which i have collected showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected this in fact is the great bar to the domestication of animals between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids there are many points of similarity in both cases the sterility is independent of general health and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance in both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees in both the male element is the most liable to be affected but sometimes the female more than the male in both the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids on the other hand one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids no one can tell till he tries whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any plant seed freely under culture nor can he tell till he tries whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids lastly when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them they are extremely liable to vary which is due as i believe to their reproductive systems having been specially affected though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues so it is with hybrids for hybrids in successive generations are eminently liable to vary as every experimentalist has observed thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species the reproductive system independently of the general state of health is affected by sterility in a very similar manner in the one case the conditions of life have been disturbed though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us in the other case or that of hybrids the external conditions have remained the same but the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and constitutions having been blended into one for it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one without some disturbance occurring in the development or periodical action or mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life when hybrids are able to breed inter se they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility though in some degree variable rarely diminishes it must however be confessed that we cannot understand excepting on vague hypotheses several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids for instance the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent nor do i pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter no explanation is offered why an organism when placed under unnatural conditions is rendered sterile all that i have attempted to show is that in two cases in some respects allied sterility is the common resultin the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one it may seem fanciful but i suspect that a similar parallelism extends to an allied yet very different class of facts it is an old and almost universal belief founded i think on a considerable body of evidence that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed tubers c from one soil or climate to another and back again during the convalescence of animals we plainly see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of life again both with plants and animals there is abundant evidence that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same species that is between members of different strains or subbreeds gives vigour and fertility to the offspring i believe indeed from the facts alluded to in our fourth chapter that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations especially if these be kept under the same conditions of life always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny hence it seems that on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings and on the other hand that slight crosses that is crosses between the males and females of the same species which have varied and become slightly different give vigour and fertility to the offspring but we have seen that greater changes or changes of a particular nature often render organic beings in some degree sterile and that greater crosses that is crosses between males and females which have become widely or specifically different produce hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree i cannot persuade myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion both series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspringit may be urged as a most forcible argument that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties and that there must be some error in all the foregoing remarks inasmuch as varieties however much they may differ from each other in external appearance cross with perfect facility and yield perfectly fertile offspring i fully admit that this is almost invariably the case but if we look to varieties produced under nature we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species for instance the blue and red pimpernel the primrose and cowslip which are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties are said by gärtner not to be quite fertile when crossed and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species if we thus argue in a circle the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted if we turn to varieties produced or supposed to have been produced under domestication we are still involved in doubt for when it is stated for instance that the german spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes or that certain south american indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with european dogs the explanation which will occur to every one and probably the true one is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties differing widely from each other in appearance for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage is a remarkable fact more especially when we reflect how many species there are which though resembling each other most closely are utterly sterile when intercrossed several considerations however render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears it can in the first place be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties in the second place some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids which were at first only slightly sterile and if this be so we surely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing under nearly the same conditions of life lastly and this seems to me by far the most important consideration new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by mans methodical and unconscious power of selection for his own use and pleasure he neither wishes to select nor could select slight differences in the reproductive system or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system he supplies his several varieties with the same food treats them in nearly the same manner and does not wish to alter their general habits of life nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organisation in any way which may be for each creatures own good and thus she may either directly or more probably indirectly through correlation modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one species seeing this difference in the process of selection as carried on by man and nature we need not be surprised at some difference in the result i have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were invariably fertile when intercrossed but it seems to me impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases which i will briefly abstract the evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species the evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction gärtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in his garden and although these plants have separated sexes they never naturally crossed he then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other but only a single head produced any seed and this one head produced only five grains manipulation in this case could not have been injurious as the plants have separated sexes no one i believe has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile so that even gärtner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct girou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd which like the maize has separated sexes and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are greater how far these experiments may be trusted i know not but the forms experimentised on are ranked by sagaret who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility as varieties the following case is far more remarkable and seems at first quite incredible but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of verbascum by so good an observer and so hostile a witness as gärtner namely that yellow and white varieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossed produce less seed than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers moreover he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species more seed is produced by the crosses between the same coloured flowers than between those which are differently coloured yet these varieties of verbascum present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other from observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock i am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts kölreuter whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer has proved the remarkable fact that one variety of the common tobacco is more fertile when crossed with a widely distinct species than are the other varieties he experimentised on five forms which are commonly reputed to be varieties and which he tested by the severest trial namely by reciprocal crosses and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile but one of these five varieties when used either as father or mother and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with n glutinosa hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified from these facts from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species from man selecting only external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system from these several considerations and facts i do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species the general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which i have taken with respect to the very general but not invariable sterility of first crosses and of hybrids namely that it is not a special endowment but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertilityindependently of the question of fertility the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects gärtner whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and varieties could find very few and as it seems to me quite unimportant differences between the socalled hybrid offspring of species and the socalled mongrel offspring of varieties and on the other hand they agree most closely in very many important respects i shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity the most important distinction is that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids but gärtner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation and i have myself seen striking instances of this fact gärtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away when mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given the variability however in the successive generations of mongrels is perhaps greater than in hybrids this greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at all surprising for the parents of mongrels are varieties and mostly domestic varieties very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties and this implies in most cases that there has been recent variability and therefore we might expect that such variability would often continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of crossing the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation in contrast with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations is a curious fact and deserves attention for it bears on and corroborates the view which i have taken on the cause of ordinary variability namely that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life being thus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical with the parentform now hybrids in the first generation are descended from species excluding those long cultivated which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected and they are not variable but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected and their descendants are highly variable but to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids gärtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parentform but this if it be true is certainly only a difference in degree gärtner further insists that when any two species although most closely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids are widely different from each other whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species the hybrids do not differ much but this conclusion as far as i can make out is founded on a single experiment and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by kölreuter these alone are the unimportant differences which gärtner is able to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants on the other hand the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species follows according to gärtner the same laws when two species are crossed one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid and so i believe it to be with varieties of plants with animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely and so it is with mongrels from a reciprocal cross both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parentform by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent these several remarks are apparently applicable to animals but the subject is here excessively complicated partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other both when one species is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with another variety for instance i think those authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the maleass than in the female so that the mule which is the offspring of the maleass and mare is more like an ass than is the hinny which is the offspring of the femaleass and stallion much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids yet i grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels looking to the cases which i have collected of crossbred animals closely resembling one parent the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature and which have suddenly appearedsuch as albinism melanism deficiency of tail or horns or additional fingers and toes and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection consequently sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semimonstrous in character than with hybrids which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced on the whole i entirely agree with dr prosper lucas who after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same whether the two parents differ much or little from each other namely in the union of individuals of the same variety or of different varieties or of distinct species laying aside the question of fertility and sterility in all other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species and of crossed varieties if we look at species as having been specially created and at varieties as having been produced by secondary laws this similarity would be an astonishing fact but it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction between species and varieties summary of chapterfirst crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by several curious and complex laws it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed this view is supported by a parallelism of another kindnamely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their hybridoffspring should generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross the fertility of the hybrids produced and the capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstancesshould all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very generally but not quite universally fertile nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences and not of differences in the reproductive system in all other respects excluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels finally then the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to but even rather to support the view that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties chapter ix on the imperfection of the geological record on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day on the nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number on the vast lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation on the poorness of our palæontological collections on the intermittence of geological formations on the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation on the sudden appearance of groups of species on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata in the sixth chapter i enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume most of them have now been discussed one namely the distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links is a very obvious difficulty i assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions i endeavoured to show that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms than on climate and therefore that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture i endeavoured also to show that intermediate varieties from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement the main cause however of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very process of natural selection through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parentforms but just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale so must the number of intermediate varieties which have formerly existed on the earth be truly enormous why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain and this perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory the explanation lies as i believe in the extreme imperfection of the geological record in the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must on my theory have formerly existed i have found it difficult when looking at any two species to avoid picturing to myself forms directly intermediate between them but this is a wholly false view we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants to give a simple illustration the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rockpigeon if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed we should have an extremely close series between both and the rockpigeon but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter none for instance combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged the characteristic features of these two breeds these two breeds moreover have become so much modified that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rockpigeon whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species such as c oenas so with natural species if we look to forms very distinct for instance to the horse and tapir we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them but between each and an unknown common parent the common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both even perhaps more than they differ from each other hence in all such cases we should be unable to recognise the parentform of any two or more species even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links it is just possible by my theory that one of two living forms might have descended from the other for instance a horse from a tapir and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them but such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change and the principle of competition between organism and organism between child and parent will render this a very rare event for in all cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms by the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parentspecies of each genus by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day and these parentspecies now generally extinct have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species and so on backwards always converging to the common ancestor of each great class so that the number of intermediate and transitional links between all living and extinct species must have been inconceivably great but assuredly if this theory be true such have lived upon this earth on the lapse of timeindependently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links it may be objected that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection it is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader who may not be a practical geologist the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time he who can read sir charles lyells grand work on the principles of geology which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time may at once close this volume not that it suffices to study the principles of geology or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum a man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time the monuments of which we see around us it is good to wander along lines of seacoast when formed of moderately hard rocks and mark the process of degradation the tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for there is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock at last the base of the cliff is undermined huge fragments fall down and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves and then are more quickly ground into pebbles sand or mud but how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders all thickly clothed by marine productions showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about moreover if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff which is undergoing degradation we find that it is only here and there along a short length or round a promontory that the cliffs are at the present time suffering the appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base he who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores will i believe be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away the observations on this head by hugh miller and by that excellent observer mr smith of jordan hill are most impressive with the mind thus impressed let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness which though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles each of which bears the stamp of time are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated let him remember lyells profound remark that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earths crust has elsewhere suffered and what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries professor ramsay has given me the maximum thickness in most cases from actual measurement in a few cases from estimate of each formation in different parts of great britain and this is the result feet palæozoic strata not including igneous beds secondary strata tertiary strata making altogether feet that is very nearly thirteen and threequarters british miles some of these formations which are represented in england by thin beds are thousands of feet in thickness on the continent moreover between each successive formation we have in the opinion of most geologists enormously long blank periods so that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this must have consumed good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great mississippi river at the rate of only feet in a hundred thousand years this estimate may be quite erroneous yet considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow but the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time i remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation when viewing volcanic islands which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height for the gentle slope of the lavastreams due to their formerly liquid state showed at a glance how far the hard rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean the same story is still more plainly told by faultsthose great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side or thrown down on the other to the height or depth of thousands of feet for since the crust cracked the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible the craven fault for instance extends for upwards of miles and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from to feet prof ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in anglesea of feet and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in merionethshire of feet yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away the consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity i am tempted to give one other case the wellknown one of the denudation of the weald though it must be admitted that the denudation of the weald has been a mere trifle in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palæozoic strata in parts ten thousand feet in thickness as shown in prof ramsays masterly memoir on this subject yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the north downs and to look at the distant south downs for remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the chalk formation the distance from the northern to the southern downs is about miles and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about feet as i am informed by prof ramsay but if as some geologists suppose a range of older rocks underlies the weald on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere the above estimate would be erroneous but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district if then we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the weald this of course cannot be done but we may in order to form some crude notion on the subject assume that the sea would eat into cliffs feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century this will at first appear much too small an allowance but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twentytwo years i doubt whether any rock even as soft as chalk would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments on the other hand i do not believe that any line of coast ten or twenty miles in length ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length and we must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base hence under ordinary circumstances i conclude that for a cliff feet in height a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an ample allowance at this rate on the above data the denudation of the weald must have required years or say three hundred million years the action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district when upraised could hardly have been great but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate on the other hand during oscillations of level which we know this area has undergone the surface may have existed for millions of years as land and thus have escaped the action of the sea when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods it would likewise have escaped the action of the coastwaves so that in all probability a far longer period than million years has elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period i have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion however imperfect of the lapse of years during each of these years over the whole world the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms what an infinite number of generations which the mind cannot grasp must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years now turn to our richest geological museums and what a paltry display we behold on the poorness of our palæontological collectionsthat our palæontological collections are very imperfect is admitted by every one the remark of that admirable palæontologist the late edward forbes should not be forgotten namely that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens or from a few specimens collected on some one spot only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored and no part with sufficient care as the important discoveries made every year in europe prove no organism wholly soft can be preserved shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea where sediment is not accumulating i believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity the many cases on record of a formation conformably covered after an enormous interval of time by another and later formation without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition the remains which do become embedded if in sand or gravel will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of rainwater i suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved for instance the several species of the chthamalinæ a subfamily of sessile cirripedes coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers they are all strictly littoral with the exception of a single mediterranean species which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation yet it is now known that the genus chthamalus existed during the chalk period the molluscan genus chiton offers a partially analogous case with respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the secondary and palæozoic periods it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree for instance not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods with one exception discovered by sir c lyell in the carboniferous strata of north america in regard to mammiferous remains a single glance at the historical table published in the supplement to lyells manual will bring home the truth how accidental and rare is their preservation far better than pages of detail nor is their rarity surprising when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palæozoic formations but the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing namely from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time when we see the formations tabulated in written works or when we follow them in nature it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive but we know for instance from sir r murchisons great work on russia what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations so it is in north america and in many other parts of the world the most skilful geologist if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country great piles of sediment charged with new and peculiar forms of life had elsewhere been accumulated and if in each separate territory hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained the frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands whence the sediment has been derived accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation but we can i think see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent that is have not followed each other in close sequence scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the south american coasts which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period along the whole west coast which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna tertiary beds are so scantily developed that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age a little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of south america no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great from the enormous degradation of the coastrocks and from muddy streams entering the sea the explanation no doubt is that the littoral and sublittoral deposits are continually worn away as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coastwaves we may i think safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick solid or extensive masses in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways either in profound depths of the sea in which case judging from the researches of e forbes we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed or sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom if it continue slowly to subside in this latter case as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough when upraised to resist any amount of degradation may be formed i am convinced that all our ancient formations which are rich in fossils have thus been formed during subsidence since publishing my views on this subject in i have watched the progress of geology and have been surprised to note how author after author in treating of this or that great formation has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence i may add that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of south america which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered but which will hardly last to a distant geological age was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level and thus gained considerable thickness all geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay on the other hand as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary thick deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts which are the most favourable to life still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation or to speak more accurately the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coastaction thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent i feel much confidence in the truth of these views for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by sir c lyell and e forbes independently arrived at a similar conclusion one remark is here worth a passing notice during periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased and new stations will often be formedall circumstances most favourable as previously explained for the formation of new varieties and species but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record on the other hand during subsidence the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago and consequently during subsidence though there will be much extinction fewer new varieties or species will be formed and it is during these very periods of subsidence that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms from the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record viewed as a whole is extremely imperfect but if we confine our attention to any one formation it becomes more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation but as they are rare they may be here passed over although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition i can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived but i can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another i am aware that two palæontologists whose opinions are worthy of much deference namely bronn and woodward have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms but insuperable difficulties as it seems to me prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head when we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed so again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct we forget how small the area of europe is compared with the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout europe been correlated with perfect accuracy with marine animals of all kinds we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes and when we see a species first appearing in any formation the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area it is well known for instance that
