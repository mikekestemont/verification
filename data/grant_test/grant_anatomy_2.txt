pleione and the halithea have the exterior covering of the body still so soft and membranous as scarcely to present an arti culated appearance some as the leech have only the trunk of the body developed and from the want of lateral setae and cirrhi for progressive motion have the segments sur rounding the body very short and numerous and thereby possess great flexibility of the trunk in the earthworm the segments of the trunk are larger and firmer and each ring is provided with eight very small curved conical hollow sharp pointed spines or setae which are disposed on the sides of the segments in two upper and two lower pairs these setse are surrounded each with a muscular sheath for their advancement and retraction and they serve as organs of locomotion in some annelides the setee are hooked at their points in others they are compressed or spatulate and in others subulate in the simplest forms of annelides we sometimes find as in the nais but one long filament or seta developed from each side of each segment which however still materially assists them in moving over a solid surface or through narrow passages or in their serpentine motions through the water the softness of the skin in most of the annelides compensates for the want of articulated feet by allowing greater flexibility to the trunk and the delicate sensibility of the whole skin compensates for the imperfect development of their organs of sense this delicate and unprotected condition of their outer surface requires many of them to shield their whole body in external solid adven titious tubes often most artfully constructed and some as the serpuke exude a calcareous conical tube from the surface of their skin which enlarges like the conical shell of a gas teropod by the successive addition of new and wider cones to its interior surface but the true skeleton of these arti culated worms as in the higher entomoid classes is their exterior skin and epidermic covering to which the muscles of locomotion are attached whether this part be hard or soft the upper lateral setae of the annelides appear to be the analogues of the wings of insects and other corresponding parts extending from the sides of the segments in higher classes when the setae of the annelides are hollow and jointed or subarticulate they are commoiily called cirrhi as we see in the long jointed cirrhi accompanying the tufts of setae on the sides of the nereides one of the most articulated forms of the body and members presented by this class is seen in the seacentiped the nereis nuntia re presented in fig where a dorsal view of the entire ani mal is given at a transverse section of a single segment at and a magnified view of one of the lateral organs of mo tion at we already find in this worm fig the head fig la b distinct from the trunk and consisting of several separate and moveable segments the head is provided with sharp curved pointed maxillae with ser rated inner edges there are numerous se parate small simple eyes or ocelli disposed chiefly in transverse rows and there are se veral lateral tentacular filaments having the character of antennae there is an enlarged anterior part of the trunk fig b e corresponding with the thorax of insects and the segments are nearly equally develop ed from this point to the posterior end of the trunk all the segments of the head and trunk are still moveable on each other they are almost equally developed and equally provided with lateral appendices in the transverse view of one of the segments fig of this nereis we observe the lateral appendices to consist on each side of a long jointed slender tubular cirrhus fig c d and a fasciculus of shorter setse placed below this lateral organ of motion is seen on a more magnified scale in fig where a re presents the jointed cirrhus and bc the tuft of setae these segments and their appendices vary much in their degree of consolidation in some being soft and transparent and in others opaque dense and covered with pearly or metauic lustre the tubicolous annelides which form the densest exterior tubes have generally the segments less marked and covered with a softer skin than those which are found in soft tubes or are en tirely without such protection we have thus already developed in the annelides the segments of the body and their jointed tubular appendices for progressive motion and all the essential parts of the skeleton which present themselves under various forms throughout the entomoid classes x myriapoda in the myriapods the skeleton is more dense the articula tions are more distinct and the jointed tubular appendices for progressive mo tion are more developed from the sides of the segments than in the helminthoid classes their muscles having firmer points of attachment act with more energy and effect and their movements effected in the thinner medium of the air are more lively than those of the hel minthoid animals which mostly inhabit a more dense aquatic medium the seg ments of the body are here more numer ous thanin the higher articulated classes and they are still as in the annelides nearly equally developed throughout the whole trunk in some as the iuli the segments are calcareous hard and cylin drical and the lateral appendices or feet are short and for the most part double on each side of each segment in other myriapods as the scolopendra repre sented in fig the segments are de pressed coriaceous composed simply of an upper and a lower arched plate attached by a softer flexible portion of the skin upon the two sides and generally each segment presents but one pair of extremities more lengthened than in the iuli the first pair of feet are here in form of simple curved perforated hooks placed at the sides of the mouth and the succeeding feet along the whole sides of the trunk terminate in a single sharp conical claw less curved with a very minute oppo sable spine extending from the interior of each terminal joint the antennae fig c c are two in number as in insects and for the most part long filiform and multiarticulate and the organs of vision generally consist of numerous simple eyes placed in a group behind the bases of the antennae in the cylindrical vermiform chilognatha the mandibles appear to be still destitute of palpi which are developed on the mandibles of the larger chilopoda the segments of the head thorax and abdomen are scarcely yet distinguishable from each other the stigmata for respiration open on the sides of the alternate rings of the trunk as if these were equivalent to only a half of the ordinary rings or segments of insects the two last pairs of feet fig j e e generally extend backwards in form of a bifid tail they are for the most part longer than the other feet and sometimes form foliated expansions at their free extremi ties as we likewise often see in the crustacea the segments of the trunk lie over each other in an imbricated manner at their line of junction so as to defend the internal soft parts during the bending serpentine motions of the body these animals do not undergo metamorphoses like insects nor ac quire wings but the number of their segments varies with their period of growth and from the density of their exter nal coverings their unorganized nature and their enveloping tubular forms they are exuviable like the dense skeletons of all the articulated tribes with articulated members xi insect a the skeleton of insects from its super ficial position and from the lightness and density of its materials is well adapted for intevertebrated animals destined for an aerial life it is composed in its densest parts of a thin epidermic layer a colouring matter often presenting the most lively hues and a brilliant metallic lustre and a thicker internal layer much resembling the woody fibres of plants but composed of peculiar animal substances termed chitine and coccine and consolidated by small proportions of the phosphates of lime magnesia and iron as in other entomoid classes the trunk is surrounded with hollow rings or segments which on the anterior parts of the body support lateral appendices ap propriated to sensation mastication or progressive mo tion and consequently on these anterior portions of the body the segments are more consolidated and more firmly united together than in the flexible and capacious pos terior part there are generally thirteen segments dis tinguishable in the trunk of insects of which the anterior forms the head the next three the thorax and the posterior nine the abdomen the annexed diagram from carus shows the form and position of these parts of the skeleton viewed from be hind in the calosoma sycophanta fig a coleopterous in sect the body of insects generally tapers more or less at both ends and the terminal segments before and behind are those least developed those composing the head indeed are so small indistinct and anchylosed together that entomologists are not agreed as to their number some considering this part as composed of one segment some of three and others of seven segments consolidated together the head fig g supports the organs of mastication and of the senses and contains internally the parts of the mouth the pharynx the commencement of the oesophagus and the two first pairs of ganglia we observe attached to the head an inferior lip or labium and a superior lip or labrum both of which extend transversely across the axis of the body a pair of mandibles without palpi and a pair of maxillae pro vided with these jointed organs of sense the head supports also a single pair of articulated antenna fig e most variable in form a lingua and a pair of eyes fig generally compound with three simple ocelli the thorax supports the legs arid the wings and is composed of three segments the anterior of which fig h is termed prothorax the second mesothorax fig m and the third metathorax fig o the pro thorax supports the first pair of legs the mesothorax the second pair of legs and the first pair of wings and the metathorax has attached to it the third pair of legs and the second pair of wings these segments of the thorax like vertebrae are composed of several ele ments which send processes inwards for the attachment of muscles and the protection of the contained organs and each of the segments exhibits a development pro portioned to that of the parts it supports or contains the parts of the legs have received names taken from those of the locomotive organs of vertebrata each leg is attached to its corresponding segment by a short round moveable articulation called the coxa or haunch fig m to this succeeds the trochanter fig i which is likewise a very short joint and less moveable the femur fig is a strong and lengthened ar ticulation commonly extended horizontally and the tibia which succeeds it is generally the most lengthened and slender joint of the leg and directed vertically the little joints of the tarsus fig a b c which follow compose the foot which commonly terminates with simple crooked ungues or opposeable chili the segments of the abdomen commonly divided into an upper and a lower piece connected together at the sides by an unconsolidated portion of the integument encompass the digestive and the generative organs which for the most part terminate in the last segment each of the abdominal and thoracic segments is perforated on each side by a small spiracle or stigma which leads into the respiratory tracheae ramified through every part of the body the wings and the legs are the parts most subject to variations of form and magnitude and their variations are accompanied with corresponding differences in the relative development of the thoracic segments which lodge the muscles and nerves of these locomotive organs in insects where the exterior or first pair of wings are little used in progression as in most of the coleoptera the mesothorax is small and the other two segments the anterior and posterior are large but in dipterous insects where the anterior or first pair of wings are alone developed the mesothorax has assumed a pro portionally great development and the pro and meta thorax are very small in the hymenoptera the meso thorax is large in the hemiptera and orthoptera the anterior segment is most developed and in the neurop terous insects the meso and the metathorax are large compared with the anterior thoracic segment the meso thorax is commonly the most important segment of this region of the body and that which best shows its com ponent elementary pieces we observe four elements on its tergum or dorsal surface arranged in a single lon gitudinal series the anterior of which is the prsescutum then follow the scutum the scutellum and the post scutellum on the anterior aspect or pectus of the same segment are seen the sternum single on the median plain and arranged in pairs on its sides the paraptera the epis ternum and the epimera these tegumentary parts form ing the skeleton of insects are thrown off about five times during the larva state and once from the chry salis before the animals assume their perfect adult form xii arachnida in those airbreathing entomoid ani mals without metamorphosis without wings without an tennae and with generally more than three pairs of legs which compose the class of aracknida we observe a more concentrated form of the segments and a more consolid ated condition of the skeleton on the anterior portion of the trunk than in the lower articulated classes the seg ments of the head are anchylosed to those of the thorax so as to form a single division the cephalothorax which supports the organs of the senses those of mastication and those of locomotion the posterior division of the trunk is the abdomen in place of the long jointed antennee on the anterior part of the head which we see in other entomoid classes there are generally a pair of lateral pincers or cheli or a pair of flat and sharppointed piercing in struments at the sides of the head more suited to their retired cunning watchful and carniverous habits their mouth is provided with a labrum a labium a pair of man dibles a pair of maxillae and a pair of jointed palpi often extended like short feet the general disposition and form of the external parts in the animals of this class are seen in this outline of the lycosa tarentula fig where a represents the cephalothorax and b the abdominal portion of the trunk the eyes are simple small isolated ocelli placed on the upper and anterior portion of the cephalotho rax and varying in number from two to twelve they are of very different sizes in the same animal and variously dis posed in the differ ent species four large eyes are seen at d placed as at the angles of a square and four smaller eyes are seen behind them at d arranged in a single transverse row the long jointed palpi at tached to the maxillae are seen at c c extended like feet in the four pairs of legs attached to the sides of the cephalothorax we observe the long femur extending as in insects from the trochanter e but we commonly lind a smaller articulation or protibia interposed between the femur and the tibial joint in some there are only six legs as in insects on the lower and anterior por tion of the abdomen or sometimes on the posterior and lower part of the cephalothorax are placed the open ings into the respiratory organs which spiracula are found to vary in number from two to eight they sometimes lead to pectinated simple airsacs and some times they open into extended and ramified tracheae although these animals retain the form with which they escaped from the ovum they throw off periodically their exterior covering like the larvae of insects and like the crustacea they reproduce entire legs when they have been removed from the body the last abdominal seg ment of the scorpion is in form of a sting or ossified tubular poisonduct as we frequently see that segment in insects xiii crustacea the crustaceous animals possess the most solid form of the skeleton met with in the arti culated classes it is found in the larger decapods to contain nearly half its weight of carbonate of lime and there is also a considerable proportion of phosphate of lime with traces of magnesia iron and soda these sub stances are exuded from the surface of the true skin along with a tough coagulable animal gluten which con nects all their particles and forms a thin varnish on the surface the colouring matter is generally beneath this varnish and on the exterior surface of the calcareous de posit but sometimes it pervades the whole substance of the shell this extravascular crust forms hollow rings to envelope the trunk and tubular sheaths to cover its appendices and these are periodically cast off and renewed on the whole exterior of the body to allow of the necessary growth of the soft parts the head and thorax are here commonly united to form as in arachnida a cephalo thorax which is covered above by a large continuous arched plate or carapace and supports the usual appen dices for mastication sensation and locomotion there are two strong mandibles with their palpi attached to them at the sides of the mouth two pairs of slender maxilke also provided with palpi and exterior to these there are three pairs of larger convertible maxillae or feet jaws with their attached jointed palpi as seen in the larger decapods as in the astacus fluviatilis represented in fig there are two pairs of antennae the inner pair a of which are commonly divided at their free ex tremities and the exterior larger pair b b have at their proximal extremity in their broad expanded basilar joint the small circular prominent opening of the vestibule or ear on each side directed downwards sometimes co vered with a membrane and sometimes with a calcined plate the eyes c c are compound generally pedun culated and moveable some times fixed or sessile the upper and anterior part of the cephalothorax is occupied by the stomach e with its strong muscular and osseous apparatus and containing five teeth in the middle of the posterior part of the ce phalothorax is seen the pro jecting portion which covers the heart towards the sides are seen the two curved longitudinal lines on the carapace which mark the internal attachment of the mem branous diaphragm which separates the respiratory cavities on the sides from the abdominal viscera contained in the middle portion of the cephalothorax the anchylosed segments of the cephalothorax send inwards and upwards numerous vertical thin calcified plates which give attach ment to the muscles of the haunches and by meeting above they form an inferior median canal to protect the nerves and ganglia of this part of the trunk there are most frequently five pairs of legs which like the exte rior pairs of jaws have branchiae attached to their bases in the female of the decapods we observe the round opening of the vulva in each haunch of the middle or third pair of legs and in the male the open sheath of the penis is seen in each haunch of the fifth or posterior pair of legs the front pair of legs are generally the most powerful and have the last tarsal joint inserted high and opposable to the penultimate articulation k k the segments of the postabdomen m n are moveable and sometimes extend backwards in a line with the cephalo thorax or are short and fold in beneath that part below the middle of the last small segment is the opening of the anus and the two last segments of the post abdo men have their lateral appendices p o in form of flat expanded caudal plates for swimming and for protecting when folded inwards the delicate inferior parts of the trunk or the ova in the female on the lower surface of the postabdominal segments are attached the false feet to which the ova are affixed after their discharge from the two ovaries and from which the branchiae are commonly suspended in the inferior orders of crustacea the chief differences in the skeletons of this class arise from the size and the forms assumed by the convertible lateral appendices of the segments and the extent to which the segments are developed or anchylosed this solid crust forming the skeleton of crustacea is thrown off periodically from every part of the trunk and even its most delicate appendices this is done by the animal first de taching the cutis and muscles from the inner surface of the old shell then excreting from the surface of the cutis a new layer of epidermis then a deposit of colouring matter and within this the calcareous materials of the new shell the old having been broken off in detached pieces in succession from all parts of the body the external skeletons of the molluscous animals are consolidated by the carbonate of lime without the phos phate which is common in the other great divisions of the animal kingdom this earthy matter is secreted from the skin in successive layers mixed avith a glutinous co agulable animal matter which gives firmness and tenacity to the whole mass and the skeletons are not exuviable as in the other articulated classes from the low condi tion of all the organs of relation in the molluscous ani mals they are less able to perceive or avert or escape from danger than the free and active articulata and they accumulate and preserve the successive layers of their rocky covering permanently in contact with their surface the sheus of these animals are remarkable for their want of symmetry on the two sides of the body the want of unity in their plan of formation and their inconstancy in animals of similar structure xiv tunicata the tunicated animals have no external shell nor internal solid parts but are covered with a tough elastic homogeneous tunic in form of an enveloping sac with a respiratory and an anal orifice this exterior sac is the analogue of the valves of conchifera and has the muscular fibres of the lining mantle inserted into its inner surface as in the shells of bivalvia it presents every variety of colour and consistence in the different species and has often a coating of extraneous particles of shells or gravel adhering to its outer surface some times it extends at its lower part into numerous short processes or into a long peduncle to attach the body to rock or other hard substances this exterior cartilaginous skeleton is most dense thick and opaque in the larger isolated forms of ascidise and is most soft delicate and transparent in the aggregated or compound forms of tuni cata two very dissimilar kinds of tunicated animals are represented in fig where is the cynthia papillata and the pyrosoma gigantium the first is permanently fixed like most of the animals of this class fig and the second is an aggregate mass of nu merous individuals which floats by their com bined movements freely through the sea in the cynthia we observe the transparent tough cartilaginous tunic forming a sac which is entirely closed except at the respiratory orifice which admits the currents of water brought by the vibratile cilia of the gills and the vent by which the currents escape from the respiratory cavity the lining muscular tunic of the mantle is most firmly united to the sac around these two orifices where there are also distinct sphincter muscles at the bottom of the sac is seen the stomach c the great branchial vein d which dilates below the stomach to form a heart the convoluted intestine e the ovary f y and the liver enveloping the pyloric end of the stomach the pyrosoma fig is a long tube closed at the upper end a open at the lower extremity and composed of innumerable distinct in dividuals c which are similarly organized internally to the cynthia but have their respiratory orifices on the sides of the long projecting external papillae c c and the vents or anal orifices of all the separate individuals open ing into the interior of the tube so that by the act of respiration alone this transparent and luminous tube is carried up through the still seas the exterior tunics of these component animals are thin soft transparent and of a bluish white colour and are the only parts by which they appear to be united together in some of the com pound forms of these tunicata however the enveloping tunic has a third opening which admits the currents of respiration or circulation to extend from one individual to another xv conchifera the shells of these animals consist generally of two moveable pieces or valves placed on the exterior of the body and connected together by ligaments and muscles these valves are composed of carbonate of lime mixed with an albuminous coagulable matter which is secreted chiefly by the glandular pores on the exterior surface of the lining mantle the valves grow by the successive addition of larger layers to their inner surface and the limits of these superadded laminae are commonly marked by distinct striae on the outer surface of the shells as the calcareous laminae are cast upon the surface of the mantle which envelopes all the soft parts of the body the shells vary in their form ac cording to the shape of the enclosed animal and es pecially of the secreting glandular portion of their lining membrane the exterior surface of the valves is covered with a thin layer of the same albuminous matter which unites the particles of the shell this forms a dense and tough varnish or epidermis which protects the colouring matter immediately beneath it and the whole texture of the solid layers although most of the conchifera are bivalved some as the pholades possess small sup plementary pieces at the hinge of the valves and are thence called multivalves the relations of these cal careous shells to the parts of the enclosed animal will be perceived by the annexed sketch of the common muscle mytilus edulis fig where the soft parts are repre sented as attached to the right valve and the left valve by is opened and folded upwards the ligament c connects the two valves together and tends by its elasticity to open them to a limited extent the liga ment of bivalvia grows like the shell by successive in ternal layers and is placed at the hinge where there are generally processes of the shell termed teeth which lock into each other when the valves are closed the position of the stomach d with the short oesophagus and the two pairs of long labial tentacula e mark the anterior part of the shell the muscular foot extends from the ventral surface of the body where we see also the byssus g by which the delicate mytiloid shells are fixed to solid bodies the respiratory orifice is placed at the most open part of the shell and near this is the vent i by which the respired water and the excretions are discharged the rectum opens near to the vent after perforating the ventricle of the heart the large lobes of the liver envelope the turns of the intestine and the pyloric portion of the stomach on the ventral or inferior surface of the abdomen is the respiratory cavity in which are seen the four long pectinated laminae of the gills m and towards the posterior part of the shell is the strong adductor muscle n by which the valves are drawn forcibly together when the animal is alarmed the ovary o fills a great portion of the posterior and upper part of the shell from this position of the soft parts within the valves we perceive the anterior part d of the shell to be that next the mouth e and the posterior part b to be that next to the anus and the vent the dorsal margin a of the valves is that next to the liver and ovary and the ventral part is that which encloses the respiratory gills m we also observe from these parts the reason for designating the one valve the right and the other b the left as we term the lateral parts of the skeleton in higher animals as these shells of conchifera are extravascular exudations from the surface of the mantle they are incapable of growth but by su perposition of new parts and the various spines and lamince which are so often developed on their exterior surface are mere depositions from the edge of the mantle and indicate former positions of the margin of the valves the ordinary direction in which these processes of the shells are formed is seen in the long narrow projecting laminae of the spondylus gcederopus fig where they are arranged with great symmetry in rows which are regular both in the longitudinal and transverse direc tions and indicate the positions of the processes of the mantle which excreted them the adductor muscle of the valves leaves a depression on the inner surface of each which marks its place of insertion and its form and which is termed the muscular impression when the shells have a short and round form as the spon dylus fig the anomia fig the ostrea there is commonly but one adductor muscle and one muscular im pression and these are monomyaria when the valves have a more lengthened form as the area fig the tellina and many others there are at least two muscles and two muscular impressions and these form the dimyaria the hinge of the valves is supported by the ligament and formed by the teeth which afford the most obvious regular and constant characters for the discrimination of these shells the teeth are seen in the figure of the area barbata fig projecting from the whole extent of the hinge and the two muscular im pressions are seen in the interior towards the ends of the valves the epidermic filaments which give a barbed appearance to the surface of this and many other shells are merely uncalcified marginal projections of the albumi nous matter which pervades all the successive layers of the valves in the anomia fig and there is a circular perforation a in the flat valve through which the central portion of the adductor muscle passes to be inserted into a third small circular calcareous piece which is perma nently fixed to some extraneous solid body the pe riphery of the adductor muscle is inserted into the flat valve around the margin of the hole so that the muscle here secretes the calcareous matter of the small fixed opercular piece into which it is inserted as the muscular foot of a gasteropod secretes the calcareous operculum which covers the orifice of its shell there is a great difference in the extent to which the right and left valves resemble or differ from each other some are equivalve or have their two valves alike in form as the cardium the mactra the solen the pholas some as the tridacna are subequivalve or have them nearly alike and others as the anomia the terebratula the gryphcea are inequivalve or have the valves very unlike each other the waved disposition of the calcareous particles in the layers of these shells often gives them a beautiful nacreous lustre especially in the more pellucid internal layers which constitutes the motherofpearl and when spherical glo bules of this matter composed of concentric layers en veloping some extraneous particle are secreted by the mantle and unconnected with the shell they form the rich pearls of commerce the edge of the mantle sometimes extends itself beyond the margin of the valves so as to touch some extraneous body and by their exuding the usual calcareous and albuminous matter it causes the con tiguous surfaces to become cemented together in this manner the oyster glues its shell immovably to the rocks at the bottom of the sea xvi gasteropoda the shells of the gasteropods are composed like other molluscous shells of carbonate of lime with animal matter they are extravascular and generally ex creted from the outer surface of the skin in the form of hol low unilocular laminated cones which envelope the exterior of the animal and they grow by the addition of successive layers to their inner surface they take the form of the exterior of the body especially of the mantle and they are perma nently connected with the muscular system the laminae which compose these shells have generally a fibrous struc ture and the parallel fibres which form them have a zig zag direction nearly vertical to the surfaces of the layers they are generally covered with a thin epidermic varnish which protects the colouring matter of the surface their outer layers are commonly more loose opaque and porous than the dense pellucid glassy layers of the interior and they are often provided with an operculum which is some times horny sometimes calcareous and is permanently attached to the muscular foot which secretes it many gasteropods have no shell as the scyllaea the tritonia and the doris some have a thin calcareous lamina within the skin of the back as the aplysia and some have an ex ternal shell so small as to cover only a portion of the animals surface as the testacella the cryptostoma and the carinaria the shell is perforated in the haliotis the fissu rella and the emarginula and it is composed of eight trans verse parallel imbricated pieces in the chiton it is however most generally in form of a hollow cone wide and open at the base closed at the apex and more or less convoluted or spiral this cone has been considered as analogous to the two valves of the conchifera united together it is short wide and nearly straight in the patella more length ened narrow and slightly bent in the dentalium a little twisted in the crepidula the haliotis and the capulus and it revolves round its apex in a single plane in the planorbis and some of the helices forming a flat disk like an ammonite in most of the gasteropodous shells the plane of revolution is constantly changing during growth so as to cause the cone to turn to the right side and to revolve in a spiral manner round an axis or pillar called the columella of the shell this spiral twist appears to be the result of the descent of the foot over the columella and the influence of the great centres of the circulating and respiratory systems on the left side of the body so that the apex of the spire is on the right side of the animal and the canal of the shell for respiration is on its left side in a few reverse shells where the spire lies to the left side of the aperture the circulating and respiratory organs are found transposed to the right side of the animal the general disposition of the soft parts in the cavity of a spiral unilocular univalve shell will be seen by this diagram of the common buccinum undatwn fig where the animal is represented as creeping upon its ex panded foot the upper and back part of the foot supports the operculum m which closes up the aperture of the shell when the ani mal is retracted the adductor muscle b is at tached to the columella and is the only part of the body adhering to the shell the mantle is open in front lines the aperture of the shell secretes the calcareous layers and covers the respiratory organs g the muscular funnel i extends through the canal on the left side of the aper ture of the shell and leads the currents to the two branchiae g at the base of which are the auricle and the ventricle h on the right side within the mantle is seen the anal orifice and the male organ the head provided with two fleshy tentacula with little black eyes at their base is extended from a short muscular neck and projects from the mouth a long powerful proboscis furnished at its ex tremity with sharp recurved conical horny teeth e the closed and tapering part of the shell is occupied by the turns of the liver and testicle in the male or the liver and ovary of the female which organs accompany each other to the apex of the spine when the animal creeps forwards covered with its shell it extends its foot its head and its neck from the aperture in such a mariner that the upper lip of the shell lies over the free edge of the mantle above the head and the foot extends over the lower lip or the columella the columella or pillar is the axis of revolution and is sometimes perforated through its interior with a cavity called the umbilicus which has no communication with the cavity of the cone contain ing the animal but tends to lighten massive shells where the wide revolutions are at a distance from each other as the calcareous layers of the shell are chiefly secreted and formed by the anterior glandular portion of the mantle which is a part most liable to vary in its form according to the age and the season the chief differences in gasteropodous shells are those produced by the diver sified forms of the upper lip in the young animals the upper lip of the shell is generally quite even and smooth and corresponds with the simple condition of the margin of the mantle but at maturity this upper secreting portion of the mantle often assumes a highly deve loped folded or fimbriated edge and the upper lip of the shell takes a similar form in the young strombus gigas the upper lip is quite even and uniform with the ordinary turns of the cone but at maturity it expands thickens folds backwards and becomes eifuse the shell of the pterocera scorpio in its young state fig has the ordinary simple thin incurvated margin of other growing shells the canal fig appears short and truncated and the apex of the spire fig pro jects naked and acute from the opposite end of the shell but as it ap proaches maturity fig the upper lip ex pands becomes effuse extends to the right and to the left side so as to conceal the apex of the spire fig a and lengthen the canal fig and it shoots upwards several processes which are at first thin and hollow open canals fig u c and are gradually filled up with successive layers and converted into solid spines which entirely change the appearance of the shell these changes of the upper lip take place periodically and at regular intervals during the development of many shells as in the murices thus producing transverse rows of variously formed processes from the outer surface of all the turns of the cone the young and the adult shells of the cypraa are scarcely recognisable as belonging to the same individual from the changes of form they experience at maturity the form of the young shell of the cypraa exanthema is represented in fig where the aperture is wide the upper lip thin and even the canal b projecting and the apex a of the spire extended and free but in the adult form fig of the same shell the aperture is contracted narrow and serrated the upper lip is thickened and rounded backwards the canal is converted into a groove and the whole of the spire is covered and concealed these adult changes in the cypraea are produced by the extension of the sides of the mantle over the upper and lower lips of the shell and now the new layers are added to the exterior surface as if it were an internal shell and the line of junction of the two enveloping folds of the mantle is marked by a trans verse discoloration or groove on the exterior of the shell along the whole of its convex dorsal part by this ad dition of new layers to its whole exterior surface the adult cyprsea has a smooth glistening naked and variously coloured exterior like the interior surface of most other shells and can present no rough epidemic covering when arrived at that state in the cypraea the dolium the harpa and many others the interior surface of the shell has experienced no change by being long in contact with the living soft parts of the contained animal the grooves the striae the prominences and even the colouring mat ters which were upon the outer exposed surface in the young condition of the shell still preserve in the adult state their primitive appearance and integrity throughout the whole interior of the revolutions these have grown by the revolution of the upper lip around the columella but many others add new layers also to the inferior or columellar lip during their growth thus covering over the superficial external layers on the left side of the revolutions and generally presenting strong parietes and a thick and solid columella as in the strombus gig as in many forms however as in the cones and olives where the widely expanded upper lip sufficiently covers and protects the smaller revolutions the total weight of the shell is diminished without weakening its exposed part by carrying forward the calcareous matter from the inner first formed concealed revolutions and depositing it upon the exterior surface of the last or outer turn of the shell which alone is exposed to danger from external causes the vertical zigzag parallel fibres composing the thick parietes of these shells is distinctly preserved in their fossilized re mains the hybernating gasteropods as the snails which want an operculum close up the aperture of their shell when they retire to their winter slumber with a thick deposit of calcareous matter called an cpiphragma which is not connected with the muscular foot like the true operculum of other shells but only with the aperture of the cone the operculum is a permanent part attached to the contained animal and the epiphragrna is a de ciduous part attached only to the orifice of the shell xvii pteropoda as the pteropodous animals are not provided with a muscular foot to creep upon a solid sur face but are all organized to swim freely through the sea by means of muscular expansions like fins they are never encumbered with a massive or heavy skeleton their skeleton when present is generally external extra vascular thin pellucid horny or vitreous it is univalve unilocular of various forms generally without a spiral twist capable of enveloping the whole body and it is destitute of an operculum as in most of the light shelled floating gasteropods and the swimming testaceous cephalopods the annexed figure of the cymbulia of peron fig represents a typical form of a testaceous pteropod from the mediterranean as swimming with its expanded fins which support the branchiae and covered below with its thin lengthened fusiform carinated and serrated shell b the up per part of its body c between its muscular and highly vascular fins a a appears to present two tentacula two eyes and an ex tended proboscis the thin dia phanous conical shell of the spiratella is twisted spirally on itself and with its apex on the left side like a turrilite the delicate pellucid shell of the hyalea enveloping the round body of the animal is tricuspid below in the shell of the cuvieria columnella there is a partially formed chamber at the lower closed extremity and in the creseis virgula the shell has a long straight conical form common to the belemnites baculites orthoceratites and many other extinct cephalopods xviii cephalopoda in this highest of the mollus cous and of all the invertebrated classes we trace the gradual disappearance of the external unorganized shells of the hiv r ertebrated tribes and the commencement of the internal organized bones of the vertebrata the shells are sometimes external as in the nautilus and sometimes internal as in the sepia and they are consolidated by the carbonate of lime as in the lower molluscous classes they are almost always polythalamous and without an operculum many of the extinct shells have the form of straight cones as belemnites baculites and orthoceratites some are curved as hamites and scaphites some are con voluted and orbicular as the spirula the nautilus and the ammonites and some as the turrulites are spirally twisted like the lurbinated shells of gasteropods the several chambers of these polythalamous cones communi cate with each other sometimes by means of a prolonged calcareous syphon as in the spirula and nautilus some times by one or more simple foramina in the partitions as the cephalopods do not creep upon a muscular foot like the slowmoving gasteropods but for the most part swim freely through the sea their shells are thin and light and sometimes xconsist of simple straight laminae unconsolidated by calcareous matter the form and struc ture of the external polythalamous shells of the cepha lopods is seen in the section of the nautilus pompilius represented in fig where shows the interior of the last formed chamber in which the animal is fixed by two muscles of attachment the syphons by which all the posterior chambers c communicate with each other are seen to extend for a short distance tapering from before back wards into each of the succeeding chambers these separated partitions and chambers of this convoluted cone have nearly the same relations to each other and to the contained ani mal as the successive contiguous layers of the convoluted shell of a gasteropod and they are formed in the same manner by periodical exuda tions of calcareous matter from the exterior surface of the mantle in the spirula the long calcareous syphon of each septum extends through the whole of the chamber and into the commencement of the next succeeding syphon so that there is a continuous calcareous tube passing through the whole shell on the inner concave side of its convolutions the shell of the sepia fig affords an example of an internal shell belonging to this class it is contained within the substance of the dorsal part of the mantle and consists of numerous nearly flat layers placed within each other the first formed being at the outer part and posterior termi nation of the shell and the succeeding new layers ex tending always more forwards than the edges of the old these compressed layers are connected together by in numerable very mimits tubular fibres so that there is a great analogy between the structure of this internal laminated shell and the external polythalamous shells where the successive laminae are more detached in the figure of the sepia fig the mantle has been cut open at to show the position and the successive lay ers of the shell the lateral muscular fins by which the animal swims extend along the whole sides of the abdomen the funnel c for the passage of all the ex cretions extends from the anterior part of the open sac in the centre of the arms or feet radiating from the head is placed the mouth d provided with two dense and sharp mandibles and the two long muscular tentacula e extend from the fore part of the head between the first and second pairs of feet in many of the naked cephalopods the dorsal shell contained within the substance of the mantle is destitute of calcareous matter and reduced to a mere thin flexible transpa rent cartilagenous lamina as we find in the loligo the sepiola the loligopsis and others these uncalcified shells are contained in a dorsal sac of the mantle like the cal careous laminated shell of the sepia the position of the thin stiliform cartilaginous lamina in the lack of the sepiola vulgaris is seen in fig where the co loured covering and skin have been removed to show the situation of the hard parts and the superficial muscles the dorsal la mina is here very small flexible and short from the great mobility of the muscular part which forms its sheath in the loligopsis guttata the dorsal lamina fig extends the whole length of the back of the man tle to the point of the tail being spearshaped with very thin flexible edges especially at its broadest middle part that of the loligo sagittata fig is more broad and leafshaped and extends as most of the other soft cartilaginous internal shells from the upper edge of the mantle to the point of the tail being contained loose in a closed dorsal sac of the mantle in the octopus the dorsal lamina is wanting but there are two small lateral stiliform loose cartilaginous pieces contained in the sub stance of the mantle as the median shell in other species in this highly complicated class of molluscous ani mals which approach so near to the cartilaginous fishes in the structure of many of their internal parts we already find several internal rudimentary pieces of an organized cartilaginous skeleton the brain encompassing the eeso phagus is enclosed in a large curved cranical bone which forms also part of the orbits on each side contains the cavities of the ears and has numerous muscles inserted into it other cartilaginous organized pieces are seen extending downwards from the back part the skull like the rudiment of a vertebral column two clavicular pieces in front unite to the first rudiments of a sternum and attach the sides of the mantle to the trunk and there are generally two scapular pieces more or less firm extending along the sides to which the muscles of the lateral fins are attached these two scapular pieces are seen in the sepiola vulgaris fig b where they support the arms c c and are freely moveable on the back like the scapulae of vertebrata we also perceive muscles inserted into the strong upper and lower man dibles fig b of these animals formed like the bills of a parrot the suckers of the arms fig b c whether sessile c or pedunculated b have their inner circular margins supported each by a firm cartila ginous circular plate with minute sharp teeth extend ing inwards from one of its sides by which the action of these prehensile organs is aided in the onychia there are dense sharp curved conical spines placed in these suckers like the conical teeth disposed on the oral disk of lampreys among the lowest of the cartilaginous fishes in the lowest vertebrated animals we still find traces of the external unorganized shells of inferior classes in the form of calcareous scales in fishes and of horny plates in many reptiles but these are generally reduced to small detached pieces and do not serve as organs of support the organs of support in the vertebrated classes are placed within the soft parts so that these animals are more intimately related to the properties of surround ing objects and outward nature by the sensibility and delicacy of their surface their skeleton being internal it is not exuviable in a mass and as it cannot grow and preserve its proportions by the simple addition of layers to its surface it is organized or permeated in all directions by vessels which take away and replace its materials atom by atom the phosphate of lime which forms the chief consolidating earth increases in its pro portion to the gelatin as we ascend through the verte brated classes so that the bones of the lowest fishes are soft flexible and cartilaginous those of hotblooded classes are of great density and strength and those of reptiles possess intermediate properties the bones have a fibrous structure which is the best adapted for the transmission of minute vessels through their texture they form solid levers for the motions of the body and cavities to protect its viscera the most constant and the first formed part of the skeleton is the verte bral column which is composed of moveable vertebrae each of which consists of several elements that are found most isolated and distinct in the lowest classes and in the embryo state of the highest the elements which appear most constant and distinct in the composition of a vertebra are the round central body or cyclovertebral element the two superior laminae or perivertebral ele ments which encompass the spinal chords the two por tions of the superior spinous process or the epivertebral elements the two inferior laminae or para vertebral ele ments which form a cavity for the bloodvessels and the two portions of the inferior spinous process or the catavertebral elements the most frequent position of these nine component elements of a perfect vertebra is shown in the annexed diagram fig where a repre sents the spinal cord protected by the two perivertebral pieces b is the common position of the artery and c of the vein beneath the bodies of the vertebrae in most parts of the column and these are embraced by the two para vertebral elements the cyclovertebral ele ments are tubular in the articulated classes of animals where they envelope the whole trunk as hollow seg ments they are nearly solid to their centre and present two concave surfaces in fishes they are convexoconcave in reptiles and have flat surfaces in mammalia they are the most constant and typical parts of the vertebral column the other vertebral elements vary their forms and positions chiefly according to the dimensions of the organs they embrace and the extent of surface required for muscular attachment consequently they vary much in different parts of the same column and in the ske letons of different classes three very different positions of the same vertebral elements are represented in this diagram fig where a shows their most common positions with relation to each other in the caudal por tion of the skeleton of an osseous fish where they are de signed to give great extension for the attachment of the powerful lateral muscles which move the tail the body of the vertebra or cyclovertebral element a supports the two superior laminae or peri vertebral elements b b which early unite above to form the small foramer for the spiral cord e and beyond their termination we observe the interspinous bone c and the ray d of the external fin which are the two epivertebral elements placed in a vertical line the analogous elements are seen on the lower part of the vertebra where the two inferior laminae or paravertebral elements form a larger foramen for the lodgment of the great continua tion of the aorta i above and the vena cava below the inferior interspinous bone g and the ray h of the external fin are the two catavertebral elements placed in a vertical line like the epivertebrals above these vertebral elements often assume in the region of the abdomen in fishes the position marked in the diagram b of fig where the superior elements remain as in fig a but the inferior laminae or paravertebrals are stretched out in a horizontal direction and have the two catavertebrals gy extended from their ends in form of a pair of ribs to encompass the organs of this part of the trunk the vertebral elements situate above the body of the bone expand in the region of the head in the same manner as we here see those below the cyclovertebral element in the region of the abdomen and this they do in order to encompass the soft parts contained in the cavity of the skull and in the face another position of these vertebral pieces which is common in the caudal region of the column in higher classes especially among the longtailed reptiles and in cetaceous mammalia is represented in the diagram c of fig where we observe the large foramen for the nervous columns above the cyclovertebral element a requiring the whole extent of the two perivertebrals b b for its formation and the strong superior spinous pro cess is composed of the two epivertebrals placed side by side in the lower part of the same vertebra the inferior laminae extend outwards to form strong trans verse processes and an inferior spinous process and an inferior foramen for the aorta i and the vena cava are formed by the approximation of the two catavertebrals g gj which show their displacement by being generally thrust backwards between two cyclover tebral elements when the two cata vertebral elements are extended outwards to form ribs in fishes we very often find them bifurcated as represented in fig the general form of the vertebral elements is very much modified and varied in different parts of the column by the shape and magnitude of the parts these elements embrace and the extent of surface for muscular attach ments which they require to present the epi and peri vertebrals are most expanded in the skull and the sacrum and the para and catavertebrals where they embrace the viscera of the trunk the appearance of the entire skeleton of vertebrated animals is greatly varied by the difference in the position of the ribs or of that part of the column where the para and catavertebral elements are extended over the great viscera of the trunk in fishes as shown in the annexed figure fig and in cetaceous mammalia the fixed ribbed and thoracic part of the column is placed near its anterior extre mity and all the posterior portion is freely moveable to give impulse to the tail in swimming in birds fig where the head and neck are used as a hand and arm for all prehensile pur poses the fixed thora cic portion a of the column is placed near to its posterior extremity and the anterior portion is free for extensive mo tion most quadrupeds fig and reptiles balanced on two pairs of extremities hold an in termediate place and have the ribbed and solid portion a of their trunk placed near the middle of the column xix pisces the bones of fishes contain less gelatine and a larger proportion of water than those of higher classes and are less dense and compact in their texture the soft bones of cartilaginous fishes yield more water than those of osseous fishes and they contain the soluble salts of soda the chloruret the subcarbonate and the sulphate while the more dense bones of osseous fishes are strengthened like those of higher classes with the more insoluble phosphates the bones of fishes resemble those of the embryos of higher animals not only in their soft gelatinous or cartilaginous character but also in the isolated condition of all the elements or centres of ossification of the more complicated bones especially of the head the skeleton of fishes consists almost entirely of the vertebral column from the extremity of the face to the end of the tail like that of the embryos of mam malia at a corresponding stage of their development the bodies of the vertebrae are composed of concentric layers as represented
