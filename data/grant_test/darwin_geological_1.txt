preface to the second edition the first edition of my geological observations on the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of hms beagle under the command of capt fitzroy rn was published with the approval of the lords commissioners of her majestys treasury in the year and my observations on south america in as both these works are now out of print and as i believe that they still contain matter of scientific value it has appeared to me advisable that they should be republished they relate to parts of the world which have been so rarely visited by men of science that i am not aware that much could be corrected or added from observations subsequently made owing to the great progress which geology has made within recent times my views on some few points may be somewhat antiquated but i have thought it best to leave them as they originally appeared in order to complete my account of the geological observations made during the voyage of the beagle i will here give references to four papers which were separately published first on the connection of certain volcanic phenomena in south america read in and published in volume v of the transactions of the geological society secondly on the distribution of the erratic boulders and on the contemporaneous stratified deposits of south america read in and published in volume vi of the transactions of the same society thirdly

extends in a nnw and sse direction thirty miles in length by about twelve in breadth my observations made during two visits were confined to the southern portion within the distance of a few leagues from porto praya the country viewed from the sea presents a varied outline smooth conical hills of a reddish colour like red hill in the accompanying woodcut and others less regular flattopped and of a blackish colour like a b c rise from successive stepformed plains of lava at a distance a chain of mountains many thousand feet in height traverses the interior of the island there is no active volcano in st jago and only one in the group namely at fogo the island since being inhabited has not suffered from destructive earthquakes the lowest rocks exposed on the coast near porto praya are highly crystalline and compact they appear to be of ancient submarine volcanic origin they are unconformably covered by a thin irregular calcareous deposit abounding with shells of a late tertiary period and this again is capped by a wide sheet of basaltic lava which has flowed in successive streams from the interior of the island between the squaretopped hills marked a b c c still more recent streams of lava have been erupted from the scattered cones such as red and signal post hills the upper strata of the squaretopped hills are intimately related in mineralogical composition and in other respects with the lowest series of the coastrocks with which they seem to be continuous mineralogical description of the rocks of the lowest seriesthese rocks possess an extremely varying character they consist of black brown and gray compact basaltic bases with numerous crystals of augite hornblende olivine mica and sometimes glassy feldspar a common variety is almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with olivine mica it is known seldom occurs where augite abounds nor probably does the present case offer a real exception for the mica at least in my best characterised specimen in which one nodule of this mineral is nearly half an inch in length is as perfectly rounded as a pebble in a conglomerate and evidently has not been crystallised in the base in which it is now inclosed but has proceeded from the fusion of some preexisting rock these compact lavas alternate with tuffs amygdaloids and wacke and in some places with coarse conglomerate some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green colour others pale yellowishgreen and others nearly white i was surprised to find that some of the latter varieties even where whitest fused into a jet black enamel whilst some of the green varieties afforded only a pale gray bead numerous dikes consisting chiefly of highly compact augitic rocks and of gray amygdaloidal varieties intersect the strata which have in several places been dislocated with considerable violence and thrown into highlyinclined positions one line of disturbance crosses the northern end of quail island an islet in the bay of porto praya and can be followed to the mainland these disturbances took place before the deposition of the recent sedimentary bed and the surface also had previously been denuded to a great extent as is shown by many truncated dikes description of the calcareous deposit overlying the foregoing volcanic rocksthis stratum is very conspicuous from its white colour and from the extreme regularity with which it ranges in a horizontal line for some miles along the coast its average height above the sea measured from the upper line of junction with the superincumbent basaltic lava is about sixty feet and its thickness although varying much from the inequalities of the underlying formation may be estimated at about twenty feet it consists of quite white calcareous matter partly composed of organic débris and partly of a substance which may be aptly compared in appearance with mortar fragments of rock and pebbles are scattered throughout this bed often forming especially in the lower part a conglomerate many of the fragments of rock are whitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter at quail island the calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest part by a soft brown earthy tuff full of turritellæ this is covered by a bed of pebbles passing into sandstone and mixed with fragments of echini claws of crabs and shells the oyster shells still adhering to the rock on which they grew numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic concretions from the size of a walnut to that of an apple are embedded in this deposit they usually have a small pebble in their centres although so like concretions a ciose examination convinced me that they were nulliporæ retaining their proper forms but with their surfaces slightly abraded these bodies plants as they are now generally considered to be exhibit under a microscope of ordinary power no traces of organisation in their internal structure mr george r sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which i collected there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect condition for their characters to be made out with some degree of certainty and four which can be referred only to their genera of the fourteen shells of which a list is given in the appendix eleven are recent species one though undescribed is perhaps identical with a species which i found living in the harbour of porto praya the two remaining species are unknown and have been described by mr sowerby until the shells of this archipelago and of the neighbouring coasts are better known it would be rash to assert that even these two latter shells are extinct the number of species which certainly belong to existing kinds although few in number are sufficient to show that the deposit belongs to a late tertiary period from its mineralogical character from the number and size of the embedded fragments and from the abundance of patellæ and other littoral shells it is evident that the whole was accumulated in a shallow sea near an ancient coastline effects produced by the flowing of the superincumbent basaltic lava over the calcareous depositthese effects are very curious the calcareous matter is altered to the depth of about a foot beneath the line of junction and a most perfect gradation can be traced from loosely aggregated small particles of shells corallines and nulliporæ into a rock in which not a trace of mechanical origin can be discovered even with a microscope where the metamorphic change has been greatest two varieties occur the first is a hard compact white fine grained rock striped with a few parallel lines of black volcanic particles and resembling a sandstone but which upon close examination is seen to be crystallised throughout with the cleavages so perfect that they can be readily measured by the reflecting goniometer in specimens where the change has been less complete when moistened and examined under a strong lens the most interesting gradation can be traced some of the rounded particles retaining their proper forms and others insensibly melting into the granulocrystalline paste the weathered surface of this stone as is so frequently the case with ordinary limestones assumes a brickred colour the second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock but without any crystalline structure it consists of a white opaque compact calcareous stone thickly mottled with rounded though regular spots of a soft earthy ochraceous substance this earthy matter is of a pale yellowishbrown colour and appears to be a mixture of carbonate of lime with iron it effervesces with acids is infusible but blackens under the blowpipe and becomes magnetic the rounded form of the minute patches of earthy substance and the steps in the progress of their perfect formation which can be followed in a suit of specimens clearly show that they are due either to some power of aggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves or more probably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of lime and consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous matter i was much interested by this fact because i have often seen quartz rocks for instance in the falkland islands and in the lower silurian strata of the stiperstones in shropshire mottled in a precisely analogous manner with little spots of a white earthy substance earthy feldspar and these rocks there was good reason to suppose had undergone the action of heata view which thus receives confirmation this spotted structure may possibly afford some indication in distinguishing those formations of quartz which owe their present structure to igneous action from those produced by the agency of water alone a source of doubt which i should think from my own experience that most geologists when examining arenaceoquartzose districts must have experienced the lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava in rolling over the sedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea has caught up large quantities of calcareous matter which now forms a snowwhite highly crystalline basis to a breccia including small pieces of black glossy scoriæ a little above this where the lime is less abundant and the lava more compact numerous little balls composed of spicula of calcareous spar radiating from common centres occupy the interstices in one part of quail island the lime has thus been crystallised by the heat of the superincumbent lava where it is only thirteen feet in thickness nor had the lava been originally thicker and since reduced by degradation as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its surface i have already observed that the sea must have been shallow in which the calcareous deposit was accumulated in this case therefore the carbonic acid gas has been retained under a pressure insignificant compared with that a column of water feet in height originally supposed by sir james hall to be requisite for this end but since his experiments it has been discovered that pressure has less to do with the retention of carbonic acid gas than the nature of the circumjacent atmosphere and hence as is stated to be the case by mr faraday masses of limestone are sometimes fused and crystallised even in common limekilns carbonate of lime can be heated to almost any degree according to faraday in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas without being decomposed and gaylussac found that fragments of limestone placed in a tube and heated to a degree not sufficient by itself to cause their decomposition yet immediately evolved their carbonic acid when a stream of common air or steam was passed over them gaylussac attributes this to the mechanical displacement of the nascent carbonic acid gas the calcareous matter beneath the lava and especially that forming the crystalline spicula between the interstices of the scoriæ although heated in an atmosphere probably composed chiefly of steam could not have been subjected to the effects of a passing stream and hence it is perhaps that they have retained their carbonic acid under a small amount of pressure the fragments of scoriæ embedded in the crystalline calcarcous basis are of a jet black colour with a glossy fracture like pitchstone their surfaces however are coated with a layer of a reddishorange translucent substance which can easily be scratched with a knife hence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin some of the smaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance a change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition at the galapagos archipelago as will be described in a future chapter great beds are formed of volcanic ashes and partieles of scoriæ which have undergone a closely similar change the extent and horizontality of the calcureous stratumthe upper line of surface of the calcareous stratum which is so conspicuous from being quite white and so nearly horizontal ranges for miles along the coast at the height of about sixty feet above the sea the sheet of basalt by which it is capped is on an average eighty feet in thickness westward of porto praya beyond red hill the white stratum with the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams northward of signal post hill i could follow it with my eye trending away for several miles along the sea cliffs the distance thus observed is about seven miles but i cannot doubt from its regularity that it extends much farther in some ravines at right angles to the coast it is seen gently dipping towards the sea probably with the same inclination as when deposited round the ancient shores of the island i found only one inland section namely at the base of the hill marked a where at the height of some hundred feet this bed was exposed it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock associated with wacke and was covered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic lava some exceptions occur to the horizontality of the white stratum at quail island its upper surface is only forty feet above the level of the sea here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and fifteen feet in thickness on the other hand at the ne side of porto praya harbour the calcareous stratum as well as the rock on which it rests attain a height above the average level the inequality of level in these two cases is not as i believe owing to unequal elevation but to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea of this fact at quail island there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit being in one part of much greater than the average thickness and in another part being entirely absent in this latter case the modern basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin under signal post hill the white stratum dips into the sea in a remarkable manner this hill is conical feet in height and retains some traces of having had a crateriform structure it is composed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of the great basaltic plain but partly of lava of apparently submarine origin and of considerable antiquity the surrounding plain as well as the eastern flank of this hill have been worn into steep precipices overhanging the sea in these precipices the white calcareous stratum may be seen at the height of about feet above the beach running for some miles both northward and southward of the hill in a line appearing to be perfectly horizontal but for a space of a quarter of a mile directly under the hill it dips into the sea and disappears on the south side the dip is gradual on the north side it is more abrupt as is shown in the woodcut as neither the calcareous stratum nor the superincumbent basaltic lava as far as the latter can be distinguished from the more modern ejections appear to thicken as they dip i infer that these strata were not originally accumulated in a trough the centre of which afterwards became a point of eruption but that they have subsequently been disturbed and bent we may suppose either that signal post hill subsided after its elevation with the surrounding country or that it never was uplifted to the same height with it this latter seems to me the most probable alternative for during the slow and equable elevation of this portion of the island the subterranean motive power from expending part of its force in repeatedly erupting volcanic matter from beneath this point would it is likely have less force to uplift it something of the same kind seems to have occurred near red hill for when tracing upwards the naked streams of lava from near porto praya towards the interior of the island i was strongly induced to suspect that since the lava had flowed the slope of the land had been slightly modified either by a small subsidence near red hill or by that portion of the plain having been uplifted to a less height during the elevation of the whole area the basaltic lava superincumbent on the calcareous depositthis lava is of a pale gray colour fusing into a black enamel its fracture is rather earthy and concretionary it contains olivine in small grains the central parts of the mass are compact or at most crenulated with a few minute cavities and are often columnar at quail island this structure was assumed in a striking manner the lava in one part being divided into horizontal laminæ which became in another part split by vertical fissures into fivesided plates and these again being piled on each other insensibly became soldered together forming fine symmetrical columns the lower surface of the lava is vesicular but sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches the upper surface which is likewise vesicular is divided into balls frequently as much as three feet in diameter made up of concentric layers the mass is composed of more than one stream its total thickness being on an average about eighty feet the lower portion has certainly flowed beneath the sea and probably likewise the upper portion the chief part of this lava has flowed from the central districts between the hills marked a b c c in the woodcutmap the surface of the country near the coast is level and barren towards the interior the land rises by successive terraces of which four when viewed from a distance could be distinctly counted volcanic eruptions subsequent to the elevation of the coastland the ejected matter associated with earthy limethese recent lavas have proceeded from those scattered conical reddishcoloured hills which rise abruptly from the plaincountry near the coast i ascended some of them but will describe only one namely red hill which may serve as a type of its class and is remarkable in some especial respects its height is about feet it is composed of bright red highly scoriaceous rock of a basaltic nature on one side of its summit there is a hollow probably the last remnant of a crater several of the other hills of this class judging from their external forms are surmounted by much more perfect craters when sailing along the coast it was evident that a considerable body of lava had flowed from red hill over a line of cliff about feet in height into the sea this line of cliff is continuous with that forming the coast and bounding the plain on both sides of this hill these streams therefore were erupted after the formation of the coastcliffs from red hill when it must have stood as it now does above the level of the sea this conclusion accords with the highly scoriaceous condition of all the rock on it appearing to be of subaërial formation and this is important as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its summit which might at a hasty glance have been mistaken for a submarine deposit these beds consist of white earthy carbonate of lime extremely friable so as to be crushed with the least pressure the most compact specimens not resisting the strength of the fingers some of the masses are as white as quicklime and appear absolutely pure but on examining them with a lens minute particles of scoriæ can always be seen and i could find none which when dissolved in acids did not leave a residue of this nature it is moreover difficult to find a particle of the lime which does not change colour under the blowpipe most of them even becoming glazed the scoriaceous fragments and the calcareous matter are associated in the most irregular manner sometimes in obscure beds but more generally as a confused breccia the lime in some parts and the scoriæ in others being most abundant sir h de la beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest specimens analysed with a view to discover considering their volcanic origin whether they contained much magnesia but only a small portion was found such as is present in most limestones fragments of the scoriæ embedded in the calcareous mass when broken exhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white delicate excessively fragile mosslike or rather confervalike reticulation of carbonate of lime these fibres examined under a lens of onetenth of an inch focal distance appear cylindrical they are rather above the of an inch in diameter they are either simply branched or more commonly united into an irregular mass of network with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers of sides some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute spicula occasionally aggregated into little tufts and hence they have a hairy appearance these spicula are of the same diameter throughout their length they are easily detached so that the objectglass of the microscope soon becomes scattered over with them within the cells of many fragments of the scoriæ the lime exhibits this fibrous structure but generally in a less perfect degree these cells do not appear to be connected with one another there can be no doubt as will presently be shown that the lime was erupted mingled with the lava in its fluid state and therefore i have thought it worth while to describe minutely this curious fibrous structure of which i know nothing analogous from the earthy condition of the fibres this stucture does not appear to be related to crystallisation other fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill when broken are often seen marked with short and irregular white streaks which are owing to a row of separate cells being partly or quite filled with white calcareous powder this structure immediately reminded me of the appearance in badly kneaded dough of balls and drawnout streaks of flour which have remained unmixed with the paste and i cannot doubt that small masses of the lime in the same manner remaining unmixed with the fluid lava have been drawn out when the whole was in motion i carefully examined by trituration and solution in acids pieces of the scoriæ takenfrom within halfaninch of those cells which were filled with the calcareous powder and they did not contain an atom of free lime it is obvious that the lava and lime have on a large scale been very imperfectly mingled and where small portions of the lime have been entangled within a piece of the viscid lava the cause of their now occupying in the form of a powder or of a fibrous reticulation the vesicular cavities is i think evidently due to the confined gases having most readily expanded at the points where the incoherent lime rendered the lava less adhesive a mile eastward of the town of praya there is a steepsided gorge about yards in width cutting through the basaltic plain and underlying beds but since filled up by a stream of more modern lava this lava is dark gray and in most parts compact and rudely columnar but at a little distance from the coast it includes in an irregular manner a brecciated mass of red scoriæ mingled with a considerable quantity of white friable and in some parts nearly pure earthy lime like that on the summit of red hill this lava with its entangled lime has certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream and judging from the shape of the gorge towards which the drainage of the country feeble though it now be still is directed and from the appearance of the bed of loose waterworn blocks with their interstices unfilled like those in the bed of a torrent on which the lava rests we may conclude that the stream was of subaërial origin i was unable to trace it to its source but from its direction it seemed to have come from signal post hill distant one mile and a quarter which like red hill has been a point of eruption subsequently to the elevation of the great basaltic plain it accords with this view that i found on signal post hill a mass of earthy calcareous matter of the same nature mingled with scoriæ i may here observe that part of the calcareous matter forming the horizontal sedimentary bed especially the finer matter with which the embedded fragments of rock are whitewashed has probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions as well as from triturated organic remains the underlying ancient crystalline rocks also are associated with much carbonate of lime filling amygdaloidal cavities and forming irregular masses the nature of which latter i was unable to understand considering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of red hill a volcanic cone feet in height of subaërial growthconsidering the intimate manner in which minute particles and large masses of scoriæ are embedded in the masses of nearly pure lime and on the other hand the manner in which small kernels and streaks of the calcareous powder are included in solid pieces of the scoriæconsidering also the similar occurrence of lime and scoriæ within a stream of lava also supposed with good reason to have been of modern subaërial origin and to have flowed from a hill where earthy lime also occurs i think considering these facts there can be no doubt that the lime has been erupted mingled with the molten lava i am not aware that any similar case has been described it appears to me an interesting one inasmuch as most geologists must have speculated on the probable effects of a volcanic focus bursting through deepseated beds of different mineralogical composition the great abundance of free silex in the trachytes of some countries as described by beudant in hungary and by p scrope in the panza islands perhaps solves the enquiry with respect to deepseated beds of quartz and we probably here see it answered where the volcanic action has invaded subjacent masses of limestone one is naturally led to conjecture in what state the now earthy carbonate of lime existed when ejected with the intensely heated lava from the extreme cellularity of the scoriæ on red hill the pressure cannot have been great and as most volcanic eruptions are accompanied by the emission of large quantities of steam and other gases we here have the most favourable conditions according to the views at present entertained by chemists for the expulsion of the carbonic acid has the slow reabsorption of this gas it may be asked given to the lime in the cells of the lava that peculiar fibrous structure like that of an efflorescing salt finally i may remark on the great contrast in appearance between this earthy lime which must have been heated in a free atmosphere of steam and other gases while the white crystalline calcareous spar produced by a single thin sheet of lava as at quail island rolling over similar earthy lime and the débris of organic remains at the bottom of a shallow sea signal post hillthis hill has already been several times mentioned especially with reference to the remarkable manner in which the white calcareous stratum in other parts so horizontal woodcut no dips under it into the sea it is a broad summit with obscure traces of a crateriform structure and is composed of basaltic rocks some compact others highly cellular with inclined beds of loose scoriæ of which some are associated with earthy lime like red hill it has been the source of eruptions subsequently to the elevation of the surrounding basaltic plain but unlike that hill it has undergone considerable denudation and has been the seat of volcanic action at a remote period when beneath the sea i judge of this latter circumstance from finding on its inland flank the last remnants of three small points of eruption these points are composed of glossy scoriæ cemented by crystalline calcareous spar exactly like the great submarine calcareous deposit where the heated lava has rolled over it their demolished state can i think be explained only by the denuding action of the waves of the sea i was guided to the first orifice by observing a sheet of lava about yards square with steepish sides superimposed on the basaltic plain with no adjoining hillock whence it could have been erupted and the only trace of a crater which i was able to discover consisted of some inclined beds of scoriæ at one of its corners at the distance of fifty yards from a second leveltopped patch of lava but of much smaller size i found an irregular circular group of masses of cemented scoriaceous breccia about six feet in height which doubtless had once formed the point of eruption the third orifice is now marked only by an irregular circle of cemented scoriæ about four yards in diameter and rising in its highest point scarcely three feet above the level of the plain the surface of which close all round exhibits its usual appearance here we have a horizontal basal section of a volcanic spiracle which together with all its ejected matter has been almost totally obliterated the stream of lava which fills the narrow gorge eastward of the town of praya judging from its course seems as before remarked to have come from signal post hill and to have flowed over the plain after its elevation the same observation applies to a stream possibly part of the same one capping the sea cliffs a little eastward of the gorge when i endeavoured to follow these streams over the stony level plain which is almost destitute of soil and vegetation i was much surprised to find that although composed of hard basaltic matter and not having been exposed to marine denudation all distinct traces of them soon become utterly lost but i have since observed at the galapagos archipelago that it is often impossible to follow even great deluges of quite recent lava across older streams except by the size of the bushes growing on them or by the comparative states of glossiness of their surfacescharacters which a short lapse of time would be sufficient quite to obscure i may remark that in a country with a dry climate and with the wind blowing always in one direction as at the cape de verde archipelago the effects of atmospheric degradation are probably much greater than would at first be expected for soil in this case accumulates only in a few protected hollows and being blown in one direction it is always travelling towards the sea in the form of the finest dust leaving the surface of the rocks bare and exposed to the full effects of renewed meteoric action inland hills of more ancient volcanic rocksthese hills are laid down by eye and marked as a b c c in the woodcutmap they are related in mineralogical composition and are probably directly continuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast these hills viewed from a distance appear as if they had once formed part of an irregular tableland and from their corresponding structure and composition this probably has been the case they have flat slightly inclined summits and are on an average about feet in height they present their steepest slope towards the interior of the island from which point they radiate outwards and are separated from each other by broad and deep valleys through which the great streams of lava forming the coastplains have descended their inner and steeper escarpments are ranged in an irregular curve which rudely follows the line of the shore two or three miles inland from it i ascended a few of these hills and from others which i was able to examine with a telescope i obtained specimens through the kindness of mr kent the assistantsurgeon of the beagle although by these means i am acquainted with only a part of the range five or six miles in length yet i scarcely hesitate from their uniform structure to affirm that they are parts of one great formation stretching round much of the circumference of the island the upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in composition the upper are basaltic generally compact but sometimes scoriaceous and amygdaloidal with associated masses of wacke where the basalt is compact it is either finegrained or very coarsely crystallised in the latter case it passes into an augitic rock containing much olivine the olivine is either colourless or of the usual yellow and dull reddish shades on some of the hills beds of calcareous matter both in an earthy and in a crystalline form including fragments of glossy scoriæ are associated with the basaltic strata these strata differ from the streams of basaltic lava forming the coastplains only in being more compact and in the crystals of augite and in the grains of olivine being of much greater sizecharacters which together with the appearance of the associated calcareous beds induce me to believe that they are of submarine formation some considerable masses of wacke which are associated with these basaltic strata and which likewise occur in the basal series on the coast especially at quail island are curious they consist of a pale yellowishgreen argillaceous substance of a crumbling texture when dry but unctuous when moist in its purest form it is of a beautiful green tint with translucent edges and occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage under the blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark gray and sometimes even black bead which is slightly magnetic from these characters i naturally thought that it was one of the pale species decomposed of the genus augitea conclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate crystals of black augite and of balls and irregular streaks of dark gray augitic rock as the basalt ordinarily consists of augite and of olivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour i was led to examine the stages of decomposition of this latter mineral and i found to my surprise that i could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered olivine to the green wacke part of the same grain under the blowpipe would in some instances behave like olivine its colour being only slightly changed and part would give a black magnetic bead hence i can have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine but great chemical changes must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard transparent infusible mineral into a soft unctuous easily melted argillaceous substance the basal strata of these hills as well as some neighbouring separate bare rounded hillocks consist of compact finegrained noncrystalline or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible ferruginous feldspathic rocks and generally in a state of semidecomposition their fracture is exceedingly irregular and splintery yet small fragments are often very tough they contain much ferruginous matter either in the form of minute grains with a metallic lustre or of brown hairlike threads the rock in this latter case assuming a pseudobrecciated structure these rocks sometimes contain mica and veins of agate their rusty brown or yellowish colour is partly due to the oxides of iron but chiefly to innumerable microscopically minute black specks which when a fragment is heated are easily fused and evidently are either hornblende or augite these rocks therefore although at first appearing like baked clay or some altered sedimentary deposit contain all the essential ingredients of trachyte from which they differ only in not being harsh and in not containing crystals of glassy feldspar as is so often the case with trachytic formation no stratification is here apparent a person would not readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava yet at st helena there are well characterised streams as will be described in an ensuing chapter of nearly similar composition a midst the hillocks composed of these rocks i found in three places smooth conical hills of phonolite abounding with fine crystals of glassy feldspar and with needles of hornblende these cones of phonolite i believe bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata which some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock in another part of the island bear to the surrounding basalt namely that both have been injected the rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in origin to the basaltic strata which cap them as well as to the basaltic streams of the coastplains accords with the usual order of succession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series the strata of most of these hills in the upper part where alone the planes of division are distinguishable are inclined at a small angle from the interior of the island towards the seacoast the inclination is not the same in each hill in that marked a it is less than in b d or e in c the strata are scarcely deflected from a horizontal plane and in f as far as i could judge without ascending it they are slightly inclined in a reverse direction that is inwards and towards the centre of the island notwithstanding these differences of inclination their correspondence in external form and in the composition both of their upper and lower partstheir relative position in one curved line with their steepest sides turned inwardsall seem to show that they originally formed parts of one platform which platform as before remarked probably extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island the upper strata certainly flowed as lava and probably beneath the sea as perhaps did the lower feldspathic masses how then come these strata to hold their present position and whence were they erupted in the centre of the island there are lofty mountains but they are separated from the steep inland flanks of these hills by a wide space of lower country the interior mountains moreover seem to have been the source of those great streams of basaltic lava which contracting as they pass between the bases of the hills in question expand into the coastplains round the shores of st helena there is a rudelyformed ring of basaltic rocks and at mauritius there are remnants of another such a ring round part if not round the whole of the island here again the same question immediately occurs how come these masses to hold their present position and whence were they erupted the same answer whatever it may be probably applies in these three cases and in a future chapter we shall recur to this subject valleys near the coastthese are broad very flat and generally bounded by low cliffformed sides portions of the basaltic plain are sometimes nearly or quite isolated by them of which fact the place on which the town of praya stands offers an instance the great valley west of the town has its bottom filled up to a depth of more than twenty feet by wellrounded pebbles which in some parts are firmly cemented together by white calcareous matter there can be no doubt from the form of these valleys that they were scooped out by the waves of the sea during that equable elevation of the land of which the horizontal calcareous deposit with its existing species of marine remains gives evidence considering how well shells have been preserved in this stratum it is singular that i could not find even a single small fragment of shell in the conglomerate at the bottom of the valleys the bed of pebbles in the valley west of the town is intersected by a second valley joining it as a tributary but even this valley appears much too wide and flatbottomed to have been formed by the small quantity of water which falls only during one short wet season for at other times of the year these valleys are absolutely dry recent conglomerateon the shores of quail island i found fragments of brick bolts of iron pebbles and large fragments of basalt united by a scanty base of impure calcareous matter into a firm conglomerate to show how exceedingly firm this recent conglomerate is i may mention that i endeavoured with a heavy geological hammer to knock out a thick bolt of iron which was embedded a little above lowwater mark but was quite unable to succeed chapter ii fernando

or of any one central eminence the most remarkable feature is a hill feet high of which the upper feet consist of a precipitous singularly shaped pinnacle formed of columnar phonolite containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and a few needles of hornblende from the highest accessible point of this hill i could distinguish in different parts of the group several other conical hills apparently of the same nature at st helena there are similar great conical protuberant masses of phonolite nearly feet in height which have been formed by the injection of fluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata if this hill has had as is probable a similar origin denudation has been here effected on an enormous scale near the base of this hill i observed beds of white tuff intersected by numerous dikes some of amygdaloidal basalt and others of trachyte and beds of slaty phonolite with the planes of cleavage directed nw and se parts of this rock where the crystals were scanty closely resembled common clayslate altered by the contact of a trapdike the lamination of rocks which undoubtedly have once been fluid appears to me a subject well deserving attention on the beach there were numerous fragments of compact basalt of which rock a distant faccedilade of columns seemed to be formed terceira in the azoresthe central parts of this island consist of irregularly rounded mountains of no great elevation composed of trachyte which closely resembles in general character the trachyte of ascension presently to be described this formation is in many parts overlaid in the usual order of superposition by streams of basaltic lava which near the coast compose nearly the whole surface the course which these streams have followed from their craters can often be followed by the eye the town of angra is overlooked by a crateriform hill mount brazil entirely built of thin strata of finegrained harsh browncoloured tuff the upper beds are seen to overlap the basaltic streams on which the town stands this hill is almost identical in structure and composition with numerous craterformed hills in the galapagos archipelago effects of steam on the trachytic rocksin the central part of the island there is a spot where steam is constantly issuing in jets from the bottom of a small ravinelike hollow which has no exit and which abuts against a range of trachytic mountains the steam is emitted from several irregular fissures it is scentless as there is no escape for the rainwater which trickles down the sides of the ravinelike hollow whence the steam issues it must all percolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom some of the inhabitants informed me that it was on record that flames some luminous appearance had originally proceeded from these cracks and that the flames had been succeeded by the steam but i was not able to ascertain how long this was ago or anything certain on the subject when viewing the spot i imagined that the injection of a large mass of rock like the cone of phonolite at fernando noronha in a semifluid state by arching the surface might have caused a wedgeshaped hollow with cracks at the bottom and that the rainwater percolating to the neighbourhood of the heated mass would during many succeeding years be driven back in the form of steam tahiti otaheitei visited only a part of the northwestern side of this island and this part is entirely composed of volcanic rocks near the coast there are several varieties of basalt some abounding with large crystals of augite and tarnished olivine others compact and earthysome slightly vesicular and others occasionally amygdaloidal these rocks are generally much decomposed and to my surprise i found in several sections that it was impossible to distinguish even approximately the line of separation between the decayed lava and the alternating beds of tuff since the specimens have become dry it is rather more easy to distinguish the decomposed igneous rocks from the sedimentary tuffs this gradation in character between rocks having such widely different origins may i think be explained by the yielding under pressure of the softened sides of the vesicular cavities which in many volcanic rocks occupy a large proportion of their bulk as the vesicles generally increase in size and number in the upper parts of a stream of lava so would the effects of their compression increase the yielding moreover of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the softened matter above it hence we might expect to trace a perfect gradation from an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the particles although originally forming part of the same solid mass had undergone mechanical displacement and such particles could hardly be distinguished from others of similar composition which had been deposited as sediment as lavas are sometimes laminated in their upper parts even horizontal lines appearing like those of aqueous deposition could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of sedimentary origin from these considerations it is not surprising that formerly many geologists believed in real transitions from aqueous deposits through wacke into igneous traps in the valley of tiaauru the commonest rocks are basalts with much olivine and in some cases almost composed of large crystals of augite i picked up some specimens with much glassy feldspar approaching in character to trachyte there were also many large blocks of vesicular basalt with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie and radiating bundles of mesotype some of these specimens presented a curious appearance owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled up with a white soft earthy mesotypic mineral which intumesced under the blowpipe in a remarkable manner as the upper surfaces in all the halffilled cells are exactly parallel it is evident that this substance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight sometimes however it entirely fills the cells other cells are either quite filled or lined with small crystals apparently of chabasie these crystals also frequently line the upper half of the cells partly filled with the earthy mineral as well as the upper surface of this substance itself in which case the two minerals appear to blend into each other i have never seen any other amygdaloid with the cells half filled in the manner here described and it is difficult to imagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its gravity to the bottom of the cells and the crystalline mineral to adhere in a coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells the basaltic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined seaward and i nowhere observed any sign of disturbance the strata are separated from each other by thick compact beds of conglomerate in which the fragments are large some being rounded but most angular from the character of these beds from the compact and crystalline condition of most of the lavas and from the nature of the infiltrated minerals i was led to conjecture that they had originally flowed beneath the sea this conclusion agrees with the fact that the rev w ellis found marine remains at a considerable height which he believes were interstratified with volcanic matter as is likewise described to be the case by messrs tyerman and bennett at huaheine an island in this same archipelago mr stutchbury also discovered near the summit of one of the loftiest mountains of tahiti at the height of several thousand feet a stratum of semifossil coral none of these remains have been specifically examined on the coast where masses of coral rock would have afforded the clearest evidence i looked in vain for any signs of recent elevation for references to the above authorities and for more detailed reasons for not believing that tahiti has been recently elevated i must refer to my volume on the structure and distribution of coral reefs p of the st edit or p of the nd edit horizontally with quartz and chalcedony the upper halves of these cavities are often filled by layers which follow each irregularity of the surface and by little depending stalactites of the same siliceous substances mauritiusapproaching this island on the northern or northwestern side a curved chain of bold mountains surmounted by rugged pinnacles is seen to rise from a smooth border of cultivated land which gently slopes down to the coast at the first glance one is tempted to believe that the sea lately reached the base of these mountains and upon examination this view at least with respect to the inferior parts of the border is found to be perfectly correct several authors have described masses of upraised coral rock round the greater part of the circumference of the island between tamarin bay and the great black river i observed in company with capt lloyd two hillocks of coral rock formed in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone and in their upper of great blocks slightly aggregated of astræa and madrepora and of fragments of basalt they were divided into beds dipping seaward in one case at an angle of and in the other at they had a waterworn appearance and they rose abruptly from a smooth surface strewed with rolled débris of organic remains to a height of about twenty feet the officier du roi in his most interesting tour in round the island has described masses of upraised coral rocks still retaining that moatlike structure see coral reefs nd edit p which is characteristic of the living reefs on the coast northward of port louis i found the lava concealed for a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of corals and shells like those on the beach but in parts consolidated by red ferruginous matter m bory st vincent has described similar calcareous beds over nearly the whole of the plain of pamplemousses near port louis when turning over some large stones which lay in the bed of a stream at the head of a protected creek and at the height of some yards above the level of spring tides i found several shells of serpula still adhering to their under sides the jagged mountains near port louis rise to a height of between and feet they consist of strata of basalt obscurely separated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of fragmentary matter and they are intersected by a few vertical dikes the basalt in some parts abounds with large crystals of augite and olivine and is generally compact the interior of the island forms a plain raised probably about a thousand feet above the level of the sea and composed of streams of lava which have flowed round and between the rugged basaltic mountains these more recent lavas are also basaltic but less compact and some of them abound with feldspar so that they even fuse into a pale coloured glass on the banks of the great river a section is exposed nearly feet deep worn through numerous thin sheets of the lava of this series which are separated from each other by beds of scoriæ they seem to have been of subaërial formation and to have flowed from several points of eruption on the central platform of which the piton du milieu is said to be the principal one there are also several volcanic cones apparently of this modern period round the circumference of the island especially at the northern end where they form separate islets the mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline basalt form the main skeleton of the island m bailly states that they all se développent autour delle comme une ceinture dimmenses remparts toutes affectant une pente plus on moins inclinée vers le rivage de la mer tandis au contraire que vers le centre de lîle elles présentent une coupe abrupte et souvent taillée à pic toutes ces montagnes sont formées de couches parallèles inclinées du centre de lîle vers la mer these statements have been disputed though not in detail by m quoy in the voyage of freycinet as far as my limited means of observation went i found them perfectly correct the mountains on the nw side of the island which i examined namely la pouce peter botts corps de garde les mamelles and apparently another farther southward have precisely the external shape and stratification described by m bailly they form about a quarter of his girdle of ramparts although these mountains now stand quite detached being separated from each other by breaches even several miles in width through which deluges of lava have flowed from the interior of the island nevertheless seeing their close general similarity one must feel convinced that they originally formed parts of one continuous mass judging from the beautiful map of the mauritius published by the admiralty from a french ms there is a range of mountains m bamboo on the opposite side of the island which correspond in height relative position and external form with those just described whether the girdle was ever complete may well be doubted but from m baillys statements and my own observations it may be safely concluded that mountains with precipitous inland flanks and composed of strata dipping outwards once extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island the ring appears to have been oval and of vast size its shorter axis measured across from the inner sides of the mountains near port louis and those near grand port being no less than thirteen geographical miles in length m bailly boldly supposes that this enormous gulf which has since been filled up to a great extent by streams of modern lava was formed by the sinking in of the whole upper part of one great volcano it is singular in how many respects those portions of st jago and of mauritius which i visited agree in their geological history at both islands mountains of similar external form stratification and at least in their upper beds composition follow in a curved chain the coastline these mountains in each case appear originally to have formed parts of one continuous mass the basaltic strata of which they are composed from their compact and crystalline structure seem when contrasted with the neighbouring basaltic streams of subaërial formation to have flowed beneath the pressure of the sea and to have been subsequently elevated we may suppose that the wide breaches between the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves during their gradual elevationof which process within recent times there is abundant evidence on the coastland of both islands at both vast streams of more recent basaltic lavas have flowed from the interior of the island round and between the ancient basaltic hills at both moreover recent cones of eruption are scattered around the circumference of the island but at neither have eruptions taken place within the period of history as remarked in the last chapter it is probable that these ancient basaltic mountains which resemble at least in many respects the basal and disturbed remnants of two gigantic volcanos owe their present form structure and position to the action of similar causes st pauls rocksthis small island is situated in the atlantic ocean nearly one degree north of the equator and miles distant from south america in west longitude its highest point is scarcely fifty feet above the level of the sea its outline is irregular and its entire circumference barely threequarters of a mile this little point of rock rises abruptly out of the ocean and except on its western side soundings were not obtained even at the short distance of a quarter of a mile from its shore it is not of volcanic origin and this circumstance which is the most remarkable point in its history as will hereafter be referred to properly ought to exclude it from the present volume it is composed of rocks unlike any which i have met with and which i cannot characterise by any name and must therefore describe the simplest and one of the most abundant kinds is a very compact heavy greenishblack rock having an angular irregular fracture with some points just hard enough to scratch glass and infusible this variety passes into others of paler green tints less hard but with a more cystalline fracture and translucent on their edges and these are fusible into a green enamel several other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable threads of darkgreen serpentine and by having calcareous matter in their interstices these rocks have an obscure concretionary structure and are full of variouslycoloured angular pseudo
