term government where absolutely no such thing exists the land is divided by welldetermined boundaries between various tribes independent of each other the individuals in each tribe consist of freemen and slaves taken in war and the land is common to all the free born that is each may occupy and till any part that is vacant in a sale therefore of land every such person must receive part payment among the freemen there will always be some one who from riches from talents or from descent from some noted character will take the lead and in this respect he may be considered as the chief but if the united tribe should be asked who was their chief no one would be acknowledged without doubt in many cases individuals have obtained great influence but as far as i can understand the system their power is not legitimate even the authority of a master over his slave or a parent over his child appears to be regulated by no kind of ordinary custom proper laws of course are quite unknown certain lines of action are generally considered right and others wrong if such customs are infringed the injured person and his tribe if they have power seek retribution if not they treasure up the recollection of the injury till the day of revenge arrives if the state in which the fuegians live should be fixed at zero in the scale of government i am afraid new zealand would rank but a few degrees higher while tahiti even when first discovered would have occupied a respectable position december d at a place called waimate about fifteen miles from the bay of islands and midway between the eastern and western coasts the missionaries have purchased some land for agricultural purposes i had been introduced to the rev w williams who upon my expressing the wish invited me to pay him a visit there mr bushby the british resident offered to take me in his boat by a creek where i should see a pretty waterfall and by which means my walk would be shortened he likewise procured for me a guide upon asking a neighbouring chief to recommend a man the chief himself offered to go but his ignorance of the value of money was so complete that at first he asked how many pounds i would give him but afterwards was well contented with two dollars when i showed the chief a very small bundle which i wanted carried it became absolutely necessary to take a slave for that purpose these feelings of pride are beginning to wear away but formerly a leading man would sooner have died than undergone the indignity of carrying the smallest burden my companion was a light active man dressed in a dirty blanket and with his face completely tattooed he had formerly been a great warrior he appeared to be on very cordial terms with mr bushby but at various times they had quarrelled violently mr bushby remarked that a little quiet irony would frequently silence any one of these natives in their most blustering moments this chief has come and harangued mr bushby in a hectoring manner saying a great chief a great man a friend of mine has come to pay me a visityou must give him something good to eat some fine presents c mr bushby has allowed him to finish his discourse and then has quietly replied by some such answer as what else shall your slave do for you the man would then instantly with a very comical expression cease his braggadocio some time ago mr bushby suffered a far more serious attack a chief and a party of men tried to break into his house in the middle of the night and not finding this so easy commenced a brisk firing with their muskets mr bushby was slightly wounded but the party was at length driven away shortly afterwards it was discovered who was the aggressor and a general meeting of the chiefs was convened to consider the case it was considered by the new zealanders as very atrocious inasmuch as it was a night attack and that mrs bushby was lying ill in the house this latter circumstance much to their honour being considered in all cases as a protection the chiefs agreed to confiscate the land of the aggressor to the king of england the whole proceeding however in thus trying and punishing a chief was entirely without precedent the aggressor moreover lost cast in the estimation of his equals and this was considered by the british as of more consequence than the confiscation of his land as the boat was shoving off a second chief stepped into her who only wanted the amusement of the passage up and down the creek i never saw a more horrid and ferocious expression than this man had it immediately struck me i had somewhere seen his likeness it will be found in retzschs outlines to schillers ballad of fridolin where two men are pushing robert into the burning iron furnace it is the man who has his arm on roberts breast physiognomy here spoke the truth this chief had been a notorious murderer and was to boot an arrant coward at the point where the boat landed mr bushby accompanied me a few hundred yards on the road i could not help admiring the cool impudence of the hoary old villain whom we left lying in the boat when he shouted to mr bushby do not you stay long i shall be tired of waiting here we now commenced our walk the road lay along a wellbeaten path bordered on each side by the tall fern which covers the whole country after travelling some miles we came to a little country village where a few hovels were collected together and some patches of ground cultivated for potato crops the introduction of the potato has been the most essential benefit to the island it is now much more used than any native vegetable new zealand is favoured by one great natural advantage namely that the inhabitants can never perish from famine the whole country abounds with fern and the roots of this plant if not very palatable yet contain much nutriment a native can always subsist on these and on the shells which are abundant on all parts of the seacoast the villages are chiefly conspicuous by the platforms which are raised on four posts ten or twelve feet above the ground and on which the produce of the fields is kept secure from all accidents on coming near one of the huts i was much amused by seeing in due form the ceremony of rubbing or as it should more properly be called pressing noses the women on our first approach began uttering something in a most dolorous voice they then squatted themselves down and held up their faces my companions standing over them placed the bridge of their own noses at right angles to theirs and commenced pressing this lasted rather longer than a cordial shake of the hand would with us and as we vary the force of the grasp of the hand in shaking so do they in pressing during the process they uttered comfortable little grunts very much in the same manner as two pigs do when rubbing against each other i noticed that the slave would press noses with any one he met indifferently either before or after his master the chief although among savages the chief has absolute power of life and death over his slave yet there is an entire absence of ceremony between them mr burchell has remarked the same thing in southern africa with respect to the rude bachapins where civilization has arrived at a certain point as among the tahitians complex formalities are soon instituted between the different grades of society for instance in the above island formerly all were obliged to uncover themselves as low as the waist in presence of the king the ceremony of pressing noses having been completed with all present we seated ourselves in a circle in the front of one of the houses and rested there halfanhour all the native hovels which i have seen have nearly the same form and dimensions and all agree in being filthily dirty they resemble a cowshed with one end open but having a partition a little way within with a square hole in it which thus cuts off a part and makes a small gloomy chamber in this the inhabitants keep all their property and when the weather is cold they sleep there they eat however and pass their time in the open part in front my guides having finished their pipes we continued our walk the path led through the same undulating country the whole uniformly clothed as before with fern on our right hand we had a serpentine river the banks of which were fringed with trees and here and there on the hillsides there were clumps of wood the whole scene in spite of its green colour bore rather a desolate aspect the sight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea of sterility this however is not the case for wherever the fern grows thick and breasthigh the land by tillage becomes productive some of the residents with much probability think that all this extensive open country was originally covered with forests and that it has been cleared by the aid of fire it is said that by digging in the barest spots lumps of the kind of resin which flows from the kauri pine are frequently found the natives had an evident motive in thus clearing the country for in such parts the fern formerly so staple an article of food flourishes best the almost entire absence of associated grasses which forms so remarkable a feature in the vegetation of this island may perhaps be accounted for by the open parts being the work of man while nature had designed the country for forest land the soil is volcanic in several parts we passed over slaggy and vesicular lavas and the form of a crater could clearly be distinguished in several of the neighbouring hills although the scenery is nowhere beautiful and only occasionally pretty i enjoyed my walk i should have enjoyed it more if my companion the chief had not possessed extraordinary conversational powers i only knew three words good bad and yes and with these i answered all his remarks without of course having understood one word he said this however was quite sufficient i was a good listener an agreeable person and he never ceased talking to me at length we reached waimate after having passed over so many miles of an uninhabited useless country the sudden appearance of an english farmhouse and its welldressed fields placed there as if by an enchanters wand was exceedingly pleasing mr williams not being at home i received in mr daviess house a cordial and pleasant welcome after drinking tea with his family party we took a stroll about the farm at waimate there are three large houses where the missionary gentlemen messrs williams davies and clarke reside and near them are the huts of the native labourers on an adjoining slope fine crops of barley and wheat in full ear were standing and in another part fields of potatoes and clover but i cannot attempt to describe all i saw there were large gardens with every fruit and vegetable which england produces and many belonging to a warmer clime i may instance asparagus kidney beans cucumbers rhubarb apples pears figs peaches apricots grapes olives gooseberries currants hops gorze for fences and english oaks also many different kinds of flowers around the farmyard there were stables a thrashingbarn with its winnowing machine a blacksmiths forge and on the ground ploughshares and other tools in the middle was that happy mixture of pigs and poultry which may be seen so comfortably lying together in every english farmyard at the distance of a few hundred yards where the water of a little rill was dammed up into a pool a large and substantial watermill had been erected all this is very surprising when it is considered that five years ago nothing but the fern flourished here moreover native workmanship taught by the missionaries has effected this change the lesson of the missionary is the enchanters wand the house has been built the windows framed the fields ploughed and even the trees grafted by the new zealander at the mill a new zealander may be seen powdered white with flour like his brother miller in england when i looked at this whole scene i thought it admirable it was not merely that england was vividly brought before my mind yet as the evening drew to a close the domestic sounds the fields of corn the distant country with its trees now appearing like pastureland all might well be mistaken for some part of it nor was it the triumphant feeling at seeing what englishmen could effect but it was something of far more consequence the object for which this labour had been bestowedthe moral effect on the aborigines of this fine country the missionary system here appears to me different from that of tahiti much more attention is there paid to religious instruction and to the direct improvement of the mind here more to the arts of civilization i do not doubt that in both cases the same object is kept in view judging from the success alone i should rather lean to the tahiti side probably however each system is best adapted to the country where it is followed the mind of a tahitian is certainly one of a higher order and on the other hand the new zealander not being able to pluck from the tree that shades his house the breadfruit and banana would naturally turn his attention with more readiness to the arts when comparing the state of new zealand with that of tahiti it should always be remembered that from the respective forms of government of the two countries the missionaries here have had to labour at a task many times more difficult the reviewer of mr earles travels in the quarterly journal by pointing out a more advantageous line of conduct for the missionaries evidently considers that too much attention has been paid to religious instruction in proportion to other subjects this opinion being so very different from the one at which i arrived any third person hearing the two sides would probably conclude that the missionaries had been the best judges and had chosen the right path several young men were employed about the farm who had been brought up by the missionaries having been redeemed by them from slavery they were dressed in a shirt jacket and trousers and had a respectable appearance judging from one trifling anecdote i should think they must be honest when walking in the fields a young labourer came up to mr davies and gave him a knife and gimlet saying he had found them on the road and did not know to whom they belonged these young men and boys appeared very merry and goodhumoured in the evening i saw a party of them at cricket when i thought of the austerity of which the missionaries have been accused i was amused by observing one of their own sons taking an active part in the game a more decided and pleasing change was manifested in the young women who acted as servants within the houses their clean tidy and healthy appearance like that of dairymaids in england formed a wonderful contrast with the women of the filthy hovels in kororadika the wives of the missionaries tried to persuade them not to be tattooed but a famous operator having arrived from the south they said we really must just have a few lines on our lips else when we grow old our lips will shrivel and we shall be so very ugly tattooing is not nearly so much practised as formerly but as it is a badge of distinction between the chief and the slave it will not probably very soon be disused so soon does any train of ideas become habitual that the missionaries told me that even in their eyes a plain face looked mean and not like that of a new zealand gentleman late in the evening i went to mr williamss house where i passed the night i found there a very large party of children collected together for christmasday and all sitting round a table at tea i never saw a nicer or more merry group and to think that this was in the centre of the land of cannibalism murder and all atrocious crimes the cordiality and happiness so plainly pictured in the faces of the little circle appeared equally felt by the older persons of the mission december thin the morning prayers were read in the native tongue to the whole family after breakfast i rambled about the gardens and farm this was a marketday when the natives of the surrounding hamlets bring their potatoes indian corn or pigs to exchange for blankets tobacco and sometimes through the persuasions of the missionaries for soap mr daviess eldest son who manages a farm of his own is the man of business in the market the children of the missionaries who came while young to the island understand the language better than their parents and can get any thing more readily done by the natives a little before noon messrs williams and davies walked with me to part of a neighbouring forest to show me the famous kauri pines i measured one of these noble trees in a part which was not enlarged near the roots and found it to be thirtyone feet in circumference there was another close by which i did not see thirtythree and i heard of one no less than forty feet the trunks are also very remarkable from their smoothness cylindrical figure absence of branches and having very nearly the same girth through a length from sixty to even ninety feet the crown of this tree where it is irregularly branched is small and out of proportion to the trunk and the foliage is likewise diminutive as compared with the branches the forest in this part was almost composed of the kauri and the largest from the parallelism of their sides stood up like gigantic columns of wood the timber of this tree is the most valuable product of the island moreover a quantity of resin oozes from the bark which is collected and sold at a penny a pound to the americans but its use is kept secret on the outskirts of the wood i saw the new zealand flax growing in the swamps this is the second most valuable export this plant somewhat resembles but not botanically the common iris the under surface of the leaf is lined by a layer of strong silky fibres and the upper consists of green vegetable matter which is scraped off with a broken shell and the hemp remains in the hand of the workwoman in the forest besides the kauri there are some other fine timber trees i saw numbers of beautiful treeferns and was told of palms some of the new zealand forests must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree mr matthews gave me an account of one which although only thirtyfour miles wide and separating two inhabited districts like the central forest of chiloe had never been passed until lately he and another missionary each with a party of about fifty men undertook to open a road but it cost them more than a fortnights labour in the woods i saw very few birds with regard to animals it is a most remarkable fact that so large an island extending over more than miles in latitude and in many parts ninety broad with varied stations a fine climate and land of all heights from feet downwards with the exception of a small rat should not possess one indigenous animal it is moreover said that the introduction of the common norway kind has annihilated from the northern extremity of the island the new zealand species in the short space of two years in many places i noticed several sorts of weeds which like the rats i was forced to own as countrymen a leek however which has overrun whole districts and will be very troublesome was imported lately by the favour of a french vessel the common dock is widely disseminated and will i am afraid for ever remain a proof of the rascality of an englishman who sold the seeds for those of the tobaccoplant on returning from our pleasant walk to the houses i dined with mr williams and then a horse being lent me i returned to the bay of islands i took leave of the missionaries with thankfulness for their kind welcome and with feelings of high respect for their gentlemanlike useful and upright characters i think it would be difficult to find a body of men better adapted for the high office which they fulfil christmasdayin a few more days the fourth year of our absence from england will be completed our first christmasday was spent at plymouth the second at st martins cove near cape horn the third at port desire in patagonia the fourth at anchor in a harbour in the peninsula of tres montes this fifth here and the next i trust in providence will be in england we attended divine service in the chapel of pahia part of the service was read in english and part in the new zealand language as far as i was able to understand the greater number of people in this northern part of the island profess christianity it is curious that the religion even of those who do not profess it has been modified and is now partly christian partly heathen moreover so excellent is the christian faith that the outward conduct even of the unbelievers is said to have been decidedly improved by the spread of its doctrines it is beyond doubt however that much immorality still exists that there are many who would not hesitate to kill a slave for a trifling offence and that polygamy is still common indeed i believe general we did not hear of any recent act of cannibalism but mr stokes found burnt human bones strewed round an old fireplace on a small island near the anchorage these remains of some quiet banquet might indeed have been lying there for several years notwithstanding the above facts it is probable that the moral state of the people will rapidly improve mr bushby mentioned one pleasing anecdote as a proof of the sincerity of some at least of those who profess christianity one of his young men left him who had been accustomed to read prayers to the rest of the servants some weeks afterwards happening to pass late in the evening by an outhouse he saw and heard one of his men reading the bible with difficulty by the light of the fire to the others after this the party knelt and prayed in their prayers they mentioned mr bushby and his family and the missionaries each separately in his respective district december thmr bushby offered to take mr sulivan and myself in his boat some miles up the river to cawacawa and proposed afterwards to walk on to the village of waiomio where there are some curious rocks following one of the arms of the bay we enjoyed a pleasant row and passed through pretty scenery until we came to a village beyond which the boat could not proceed from this place a chief and a party of men volunteered to walk with us to waiomio a distance of four miles the chief was at this time rather notorious from having lately hung one of his wives and a slave for adultery when one of the missionaries remonstrated with him he seemed surprised and said he thought he was exactly following the english method old shongi who happened to be in england during the queens trial expressed great disapprobation at the whole proceeding he said he had five wives and he would rather cut off all their heads than be so much troubled about one leaving this village we crossed over to another seated on a hillside at a little distance the daughter of a chief who was still a heathen had died here five days before the hovel in which she had expired had been burnt to the ground her body being enclosed between two small canoes was placed upright on the ground and protected by an enclosure bearing wooden images of their gods and the whole was painted bright red so as to be conspicuous from afar her gown was fastened to the coffin and her hair being cut off was cast at its foot the relatives of the family had torn the flesh of their arms bodies and faces so that they were covered with clotted blood and the old women looked most filthy disgusting objects on the following day some of the officers visited this place and found the women still howling and cutting themselves we continued our walk and soon reached waiomio here there are some singular masses of limestone resembling ruined castles these rocks have long served for burialplaces and in consequence are held sacred one of the young men cried out let us all be brave and ran on ahead but when within a hundred yards the whole party thought better of it and stopped short with perfect indifference however they allowed us to examine the whole place at this village we rested some hours during which time there was a long discussion with mr bushby concerning the right of sale of certain lands one old man who appeared a perfect genealogist illustrated the successive possessors by bits of stick driven into the ground before leaving the houses a little basketful of roasted sweetpotatoes was given to each of our party and we all according to the custom carried them away to eat on the road i noticed that among the women employed in cooking there was a manslave it must be an humiliating thing for a man in this warlike country to be employed in doing that which is considered as the lowest womans work slaves are not allowed to go to war but this perhaps can hardly be considered as a hardship i heard of one poor wretch who during hostilities ran away to the opposite party being met by two men he was immediately seized but they not agreeing to whom he should belong each stood over him with a stone hatchet and seemed determined that the other at least should not take him away alive the poor man almost dead with fright was only saved by the address of a chiefs wife we afterwards enjoyed a pleasant walk back to the boat but did not reach the ship till late in the evening december thin the afternoon we stood out of the bay of islands on our course to sydney i believe we were all glad to leave new zealand it is not a pleasant place amongst the natives there is absent that charming simplicity which is found at tahiti and the greater part of the english are the very refuse of society neither is the country itself attractive i look back but to one bright spot and that is waimate with its christian inhabitants chapter xxi sydney prosperity excursion to bathurst aspect of woods party of natives gradual extinction of aborigines blue mountains weatherboard view of a grand

of country bald head calcareous casts like branches of trees party of natives leave australia australia january th early in the morning a light air carried us towards the entrance of port jackson instead of beholding a verdant country scattered over with fine houses a straight line of yellowish cliff brought to our minds the coast of patagonia a solitary lighthouse built of white stone alone told us we were near a great and populous city having entered the harbour it appeared fine and spacious but the level country showing on the cliffformed shores bare and horizontal strata of sandstone was covered by woods of thin scrubby trees that bespoke useless sterility proceeding further inland the country improved beautiful villas and nice cottages were here and there scattered along the beach in the distance stone houses two and three stories high and windmills standing on the edge of a bank pointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of australia at last we anchored within sydney cove we found the little basin occupied by many large ships and surrounded by warehouses in the evening i walked through the town and returned full of admiration at the whole scene it is a most magnificent testimony to the power of the british nation here in a less promising country scores of years have effected many times more than the same number of centuries have done in south america my first feeling was to congratulate myself that i was born an englishman upon seeing more of the town afterwards perhaps my admiration fell a little but yet it is a fine town the streets are regular broad clean and kept in excellent order the houses are of a good size and the shops well furnished it may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from london and a few other great towns in england but not even near london or birmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth the number of large houses just finished and others building was truly surprising nevertheless every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in procuring a house in the streets gigs phaetons and carriages with livery servants were driving about and of the latter many were extremely well equipped coming from south america where in the towns every man of property is known no one thing surprised me more than not being able to ascertain readily to whom this or that carriage belonged many of the older residents say that formerly they knew every face in the colony but now that in a mornings ride it is a chance if they know one sydney has a population of twentythree thousand and is rapidly increasing it must contain much wealth it appears that a man of business can hardly fail to make a large fortune i saw on all sides fine housesone built from the profits of steamvesselsanother from building and so on an auctioneer who was a convict it is said intends to return home and will take with him pounds another has an income so large that scarcely any body ventures to guess at itthe least sum assigned being fifteen thousand a year but the two crowning facts arefirst that the public revenue has increased l during this last year and secondly that less than an acre of land within the town of sydney sold for l sterling i hired a man and two horses to take me to bathurst a village about one hundred and twenty miles in the interior and the centre of a great pastoral district by this means i hoped to get a general idea of the appearance of the country on the morning of the th january i set out on my excursion the first stage took us to paramatta a small countrytown the second to sydney in importance the roads were excellent and made upon the macadam principle whinstone having been brought for the purpose from the distance of several miles the road appeared much frequented by all sorts of carriages and i met two stagecoaches in all these respects there was a close resemblance to england perhaps the number of alehouses was here in excess the iron gangs or parties of convicts who have here committed some trifling offence appeared the least like england they were working in chains under the charge of sentries with loaded arms the power which the government possesses by means of forced labour of at once opening good roads throughout the country has been i believe one main cause of the early prosperity of this colony i slept at night at a very comfortable inn at emu ferry thirtyfive miles from sydney and near the ascent of the blue mountains this line of road is the most frequented and has been longest inhabited of any in the colony the whole land is enclosed with high railings for the farmers have not succeeded in rearing hedges there are many substantial houses and good cottages scattered about but although considerable pieces of land are under cultivation the greater part yet remains as when first discovered making allowances for the cleared parts the country here resembled all that i saw during the ten succeeding days the extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of new south wales every where we have an open woodland the ground being partially covered with a very thin pasture the trees nearly all belong to one family and mostly have the surface of their leaves placed in a vertical instead of as in europe a nearly horizontal position the foliage is scanty and of a peculiar pale green tint without any gloss hence the woods appear light and shadowless this although a loss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer is of importance to the farmer as it allows grass to grow where it otherwise could not the leaves are not shed periodically this character appears common to the entire southern hemisphere namely south america australia and the cape of good hope the inhabitants of this hemisphere and of the intertropical regions thus lose perhaps one of the most glorious though to our eyes common spectacles in the worldthe first bursting into full foliage of the leafless tree they may however say that we pay dearly for our spectacle by having the land covered with mere naked skeletons for so many months this is too true but our senses thus acquire a keen relish for the exquisite green of the spring which the eyes of those living within the tropics sated during the long year with the gorgeous productions of those glowing climates can never experience the greater number of the trees with the exception of some of the blue gums do not attain a large size but they grow tall and tolerably straight and stand well apart the bark of some falls annually or hangs dead in long shreds which swing about with the wind and hence the woods appear desolate and untidy nowhere is there an appearance of verdure but rather that of arid sterility i cannot imagine a more complete contrast in every respect than between the forests of valdivia or chiloe and the woods of australia although this colony flourishes so remarkably the appearance of infertility is to a certain degree real the soil without doubt is good but there is so great a deficiency both of rain and running water that it cannot produce much the agricultural crops and often those in gardens are estimated to fail once in three years and this has even happened on successive years hence the colony cannot supply itself with the bread and vegetables which its inhabitants consume it is essentially pastoral and chiefly so for sheep and not the larger quadrupeds the alluvial land near emu ferry was some of the best cultivated which i saw and certainly the scenery on the banks of the nepean bounded to the west by the blue mountains was pleasing even to the eye of a person thinking of england at sunset a party of a score of the black aborigines passed by each carrying in their accustomed manner a bundle of spears and other weapons by giving a leading young man a shilling they were easily detained and threw their spears for my amusement they were all partly clothed and several could speak a little english their countenances were goodhumoured and pleasant and they appeared far from being such utterly degraded beings as they are usually represented in their own arts they are admirable a cap being fixed at thirty yards distance they transfixed it with a spear delivered by the throwing stick with the rapidity of an arrow from the bow of a practised archer in tracking animals or men they show most wonderful sagacity and i heard of several of their remarks which manifested considerable acuteness they will not however cultivate the ground or build houses and remain stationary or even take the trouble of tending a flock of sheep when given to them on the whole they appear to me to stand some few degrees higher in the scale of civilization than the fuegians it is very curious thus to see in the midst of a civilized people a set of harmless savages wandering about without knowing where they shall sleep at night and gaining their livelihood by hunting in the woods as the white man has travelled onwards he has spread over the country belonging to several tribes these although thus enclosed by one common people keep up their ancient distinctions and sometimes go to war with each other in an engagement which took place lately the two parties most singularly chose the centre of the village of bathurst for the field of battle this was of service to the defeated side for the runaway warriors took refuge in the barracks the number of aborigines is rapidly decreasing in my whole ride with the exception of some boys brought up in the houses i saw only one other party these were rather more numerous than the first and not so well clothed this decrease no doubt must be partly owing to the introduction of spirits to european diseases even the milder ones of which as the measles prove very destructive and to the gradual extinction of the wild animals it is said that numbers of their children invariably perish in very early infancy from the effects of their wandering life as the difficulty of procuring food increases so must their wandering habits and hence the population without any apparent deaths from famine is repressed in a manner extremely sudden compared to what happens in civilized countries where the father may add to his labour without destroying his offspring besides these several evident causes of destruction there appears to be some more mysterious agency generally at work wherever the european has trod death seems to pursue the aboriginal we may look to the wide extent of the americas polynesia the cape of good hope and australia and we shall find the same result nor is it the white man alone that thus acts the destroyer the polynesian of malay extraction has in parts of the east indian archipelago thus driven before him the darkcoloured native the varieties of man seem to act on each other in the same way as different species of animalsthe stronger always extirpating the weaker it was melancholy at new zealand to hear the fine energetic natives saying they knew the land was doomed to pass from their children every one has heard of the inexplicable reduction of the population in the beautiful and healthy island of tahiti since the date of captain cooks voyages although in that case we might have expected it would have been otherwise for infanticide which formerly prevailed to so extraordinary a degree has ceased and the murderous wars have become less frequent the rev j williams in his interesting work says that the first intercourse between natives and europeans is invariably attended with the introduction of fever dysentery or some other disease which carries off numbers of the people again he affirms it is certainly a fact which cannot be controverted that most of the diseases which have raged in the islands during my residence there have been introduced by ships and what renders this fact remarkable is that there might be no appearance of disease among the crew of the ship which conveyed this destructive importation this statement is not quite so extraordinary as it at first appears for several cases are on record of the most malignant fevers having broken out although the parties themselves who were the cause were not affected in the early part of the reign of george iii a prisoner who had been confined in a dungeon was taken in a coach with four constables before a magistrate and although the man himself was not ill the four constables died from a short putrid fever but the contagion extended to no others from these facts it would almost appear as if the effluvium of one set of men shut up for some time together was poisonous when inhaled by others and perhaps more so if the men be of different races mysterious as this circumstance appears to be it is not more surprising than that the body of ones fellowcreature directly after death and before putrefaction has commenced should often be of so deleterious a quality that the mere puncture from an instrument used in its dissection should prove fatal january thearly in the morning we passed the nepean in a ferryboat the river although at this spot both broad and deep had a very small body of running water having crossed a low piece of land on the opposite side we reached the slope of the blue mountains the ascent is not steep the road having been cut with much care on the side of a sandstone cliff at no great elevation an almost level plain extends which rising imperceptibly to the westward at last attains a height of more than three thousand feet from so grand a title as blue mountains and from their absolute altitude i expected to have seen a bold chain of mountains crossing the country but instead of this a sloping plain presents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land of the coast from this first slope the view of the extensive woodland to the eastward was striking and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty but when once on the sandstone platform the scenery becomes exceedingly monotonous each side of the road is bordered by scrubby trees of the neverfailing eucalyptus family and with the exception of two or three small inns there are no houses or cultivated land the road moreover is solitary the most frequent object being a bullockwaggon piled up with bales of wool in the middle of the day we baited our horses at a little inn called the weatherboard the country here is elevated feet above the sea about a mile and a half from this place there is a view exceedingly well worth visiting by following down a little valley and its tiny rill of water an immense gulf is unexpectedly seen through the trees which border the pathway at the depth of perhaps feet walking on a few yards one stands on the brink of a vast precipice and below is the grand bay or gulf for i know not what other name to give it thickly covered with forest the point of view is situated as if at the head of a bay the line of cliff diverging on each side and showing headland behind headland as on a bold seacoast these cliffs are composed of horizontal strata of whitish sandstone and so absolutely vertical are they that in many places a person standing on the edge and throwing down a stone can see it strike the trees in the abyss below so unbroken is the line that it is said in order to reach the foot of the waterfall formed by this little stream it is necessary to go a distance of sixteen miles round about five miles distant in front another line of cliff extends which thus appears completely to encircle the valley and hence the name of bay is justified as applied to this grand amphitheatrical depression if we imagine a winding harbour with its deep water surrounded by bold clifflike shores laid dry and a forest sprung up on its sandy bottom we should then have the appearance and structure here exhibited this kind of view was to me quite novel and extremely magnificent in the evening we reached the blackheath the sandstone plateau has here attained the elevation of feet and is covered as before with the same kind of scrubby wood from the road there were occasional glimpses into a profound valley of the same character as the one described but from the steepness and depth of its sides the bottom was scarcely ever to be seen the blackheath is a very comfortable inn kept by an old soldier and it reminded me of the small inns in north wales i was surprised to find that here at the distance of more than seventy miles from sydney fifteen beds could be made up for travellers january thvery early in the morning i walked about three miles to see govetts leap a view of a similar but even perhaps more stupendous character than that near the weatherboard so early in the day the gulf was filled with a thin blue haze which although destroying the general effect added to the apparent depth at which the forest was stretched below the country on which we were standing soon after leaving the blackheath we descended from the sandstone platform by the pass of mount victoria to effect this pass an enormous quantity of stone has been cut through the design and its manner of execution would have been worthy of any line of road in englandeven that of holyhead we now entered upon a country less elevated by nearly a thousand feet and consisting of granite with the change of rock the vegetation improved the trees were both finer and stood further apart and the pasture between them was a little greener and more plentiful at hassans walls i left the high road and made a short detour to a farm called walerawang to the superintendent of which i had a letter of introduction from the owner in sydney mr browne had the kindness to ask me to stay the ensuing day which i had much pleasure in doing this place offers an example of one of the large farming or rather sheepgrazing establishments of the colony cattle and horses are however in this case rather more numerous than usual owing to some of the valleys being swampy and producing a coarser pasture the sheep were in number of which the greater part were feeding under the care of different shepherds on unoccupied ground at the distance of more than a hundred miles and beyond the limits of the colony mr browne had just finished this day the last of the shearing of seven thousand sheep the rest being sheared in another place i believe the profit of the average produce of wool from sheep would be more than l sterling two or three flat pieces of ground near the house were cleared and cultivated with corn which the harvest men were now reaping but no more wheat is sown than sufficient for the annual support of the labourers employed on the establishment the usual number of assigned convict servants here is about forty but at the present time there were rather more although the farm was well stocked with every requisite there was an apparent absence of comfort and not even a single woman resided here the sunset of a fine day will generally cast an air of happy contentment on any scene but here at this retired farmhouse the brightest tints on the surrounding woods could not make me forget that forty hardened profligate men were ceasing from their daily labours like the slaves from africa yet without their just claim for compassion early on the next morning mr archer the joint superintendent had the kindness to take me out kangaroohunting we continued riding the greater part of the day but had very bad sport not seeing a kangaroo or even a wild dog the greyhounds pursued a kangaroo rat into a hollow tree out of which we dragged it it is an animal as big as a rabbit but with the figure of a kangaroo a few years since this country abounded with wild animals but now the emu is banished to a long distance and the kangaroo is become scarce to both the english greyhound is utterly destructive it may be long before these animals are altogether exterminated but their doom is fixed the natives are always anxious to borrow the dogs from the farmhouses the use of them the offal when an animal is killed and milk from the cows are the peaceofferings of the settlers who push further and further towards the interior the thoughtless aboriginal blinded by these trifling advantages is delighted at the approach of the white man who seems predestined to inherit the country of his children although having bad sport we enjoyed a pleasant ride the woodland is generally so open that a person on horseback can gallop through it it is traversed by a few flatbottomed valleys which are green and free from trees in such spots the scenery was like that of a park and pretty in the whole country i scarcely saw a place without the marks of fire whether these had been more or less recentwhether the stumps were more or less black was the greatest change which varied the uniformity so wearisome to the travellers eye in these woods there are not many birds i saw however some large flocks of the white cockatoo feeding in a cornfield and a few most beautiful parrots crows like our jackdaws were not uncommon and another bird something like the magpie the english have not been very particular in giving names to the productions of australia trees of one genus casuarina are called oaks for no one reason that i can discover without it is that there is no one point of resemblance some quadrupeds are called tigers and hyenas simply because they are carnivorous and so on in many other cases in the dusk of the evening i took a stroll along a chain of ponds which in this dry country represented the course of a river and had the good fortune to see several of the famous platypus or ornithorhyncus paradoxus they were diving and playing about the surface of the water but showed so little of their bodies that they might easily have been mistaken for waterrats mr browne shot one certainly it is a most extraordinary animal the stuffed specimens do not at all give a good idea of the recent appearance of its head and beak the latter becoming hard and contracted a little time before this i had been lying on a sunny bank and was reflecting on the strange character of the animals of this country as compared with the rest of the world an unbeliever in every thing beyond his own reason might exclaim two distinct creators must have been at work their object however has been the same and certainly the end in each case is complete while thus thinking i observed the hollow conical pitfall of the lionant first a fly fell down the treacherous slope and immediately disappeared then came a large but unwary ant its struggles to escape being very violent those curious little jets of sand described by kirby as being flirted by the insects tail were promptly directed against the expected victim but the ant enjoyed a better fate than the fly and escaped the fatal jaws which lay concealed at the base of the conical hollow there can be no doubt but that this predacious larva belongs to the same genus with the european kind though to a different species now what would the sceptic say to this would any two workmen ever have hit upon so beautiful so simple and yet so artificial a contrivance it cannot be thought so one hand has surely worked throughout the universe january tha long days ride to bathurst before joining the high road we followed a mere path through the forest and the country with the exception of a few squatters huts was very solitary a squatter is a freed or ticket of leave man who builds a hut with bark on unoccupied ground buys or steals a few animals sells spirits without a licence receives stolen goodsand so at last becomes rich and turns farmer he is the horror of all his honest neighbours a crawler is an assigned convict who runs away and lives how he can by labour and petty theft the bush ranger is an open villain who subsists by highway robbery and plunder generally he is desperate and will sooner be killed than taken alive in the country it is necessary to understand these three names for they are in common use this day we experienced the siroccolike wind of australia which comes from the parched deserts of the interior clouds of dust were travelling in every direction and the wind felt like that which has passed over a fire i afterwards heard that the thermometer out of doors stood at and in a room in a closed house at in the afternoon we came in view of the downs of bathurst these undulating but nearly level plains are very remarkable in this country from being absolutely destitute of a single tree they support only a very thin brown pasture we rode some miles across this kind of country and then reached the township of bathurst which is seated in the middle of what may be called either a very broad valley or narrow plain bathurst has a singular and not very inviting appearance groups of small houses and a few large ones are scattered rather thickly over two or three miles of a bare country which is divided into numerous fields by lines of rails a good many gentlemen live in the neighbourhood and some possess very comfortable houses a hideous little red brick church stands by itself on a hill and barracks and government buildings occupy the centre of the township i was told not to form too bad an opinion of the country by judging from that on the roadside nor too good a one from bathurst in this latter respect i did not feel myself in the least danger of being prejudiced it must be confessed that the season had been one of great drought and that the country did not wear a favourable aspect although i understand it was incomparably worse two or three months before the secret of the rapidly growing prosperity of bathurst is that the brown pasture which appears to the strangers eye so wretched is excellent for sheepgrazing the town stands on the banks of the macquarie this is one of the rivers whose waters flow into the vast and scarcely known interior the line of watershed which divides the inland streams from those of the coast has an elevation of about feet bathurst is and runs in a north and south direction at the distance of about eighty or a hundred miles from the seaside the macquarie figures in the map as a respectable river and is the largest of those that drain this part of the inland slope yet to my surprise i found it a mere chain of ponds separated from each other by spaces almost dry generally a small stream is running and sometimes there are high and impetuous floods scanty as the supply of the water is throughout this district it becomes still scantier further inland january di commenced my return and followed a new road called lockyers line in which the country is rather more hilly and picturesque this was a long days ride and the house where i wished to sleep was some way off the road and not easily found i met on this and indeed on all other occasions a very general and ready civility among the lower orders which when one considers what they are and what they have been would scarcely have been expected the farm where i passed the night was owned by two young men who had only lately come out and were beginning a settlers life the total want of almost every comfort was not very attractive but future and certain prosperity was before their eyes and that not far distant the next day we passed through large tracts of country in flames volumes of smoke sweeping across the road before noon we joined our former track and ascended mount victoria i slept at the weatherboard and before dark took another walk to the amphitheatre on the road to sydney i spent a very pleasant evening with captain king at dunheved and thus ended my little excursion in the colony of new south wales before arriving here the three things which interested me most werethe state of society amongst the higher classes the condition of the convicts and the degree of attraction sufficient to induce persons to emigrate of course after so very short a visit ones opinion is worth scarcely any thing but it is as difficult not to form some opinion as it is to form a correct judgment on the whole from what i heard more than from what i saw i was disappointed in the state of society the whole community is rancorously divided into parties on almost every subject among those who from their station in life ought to be the best many live in such open profligacy that respectable people cannot associate with them there is much jealousy between the children of the rich emancipist and the free settlers the former being pleased to consider honest men as interlopers the whole population poor and rich are bent on acquiring wealth amongst the higher orders wool and sheepgrazing form the constant subject of conversation the very low ebb of literature is strongly marked by the emptiness of the booksellers shops for they are inferior even to those in the smaller countrytowns of england there are many serious drawbacks to the comforts of families the chief of which perhaps is being surrounded by convict servants how thoroughly odious to every feeling to be waited on by a man who the day before perhaps was flogged from your representation for some trifling misdemeanor the female servants are of course much worse hence children learn the vilest expressions and it is fortunate if not equally vile ideas on the other hand the capital of a person without any trouble on his part produces him treble interest to what it will in england and with care he is sure to grow rich the luxuries of life are in abundance and very little dearer and most articles of food cheaper than in england the climate is splendid and quite healthy but to my mind its charms are lost by the uninviting aspect of the country settlers possess a great advantage in finding their sons of service when very young at the age of from sixteen to twenty they frequently take charge of distant farming stations this however must happen
