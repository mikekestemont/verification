the only landbird with bright colours is that species of tyrantflycatcher which seems to be a wanderer from the continent of shells there are a considerable number of land kinds all of which i believe are confined to this archipelago even of marine species a large proportion were not known before the collection made by mr cuming on these islands was brought to england i will not here attempt to come to any definite conclusions as the species have not been accurately examined but we may infer that with the exception of a few wanderers the organic beings found on this archipelago are peculiar to it and yet that their general form strongly partakes of an american character it would be impossible for any one accustomed to the birds of chile and la plata to be placed on these islands and not to feel convinced that he was as far as the organic world was concerned on american ground this similarity in type between distant islands and continents while the species are distinct has scarcely been sufficiently noticed the circumstance would be explained according to the views of some authors by saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law over a wide area it has been mentioned that the inhabitants can distinguish the tortoises according to the islands whence they are brought i was also informed that many of the islands possess trees and plants which do not occur on the others for instance the berrybearing tree called guyavita which is common on james island certainly is not found on charles island though appearing equally well fitted for it unfortunately i was not aware of these facts till my collection was nearly completed it never occurred to me that the productions of islands only a few miles apart and placed under the same physical conditions would be dissimilar i therefore did not attempt to make a series of specimens from the separate islands it is the fate of every voyager when he has just discovered what object in any place is more particularly worthy of his attention to be hurried from it in the case of the mockingbird i ascertained and have brought home the specimens that one species orpheus trifasciatus gould is exclusively found in charles island a second o parvulus on albemarle island and a third o melanotus common to james and chatham islands the two last species are closely allied but the first would be considered by every naturalist as quite distinct i examined many specimens in the different islands and in each the respective kind was alone present these birds agree in general plumage structure and habits so that the different species replace each other in the economy of the different islands these species are not characterized by the markings on the plumage alone but likewise by the size and form of the bill and other differences i have stated that in the thirteen species of groundfinches a nearly perfect gradation may be traced from a beak extraordinarily thick to one so fine that it may be compared to that of a warbler i very much suspect that certain members of the series are confined to different islands therefore if the collection had been made on any one island it would not have presented so perfect a gradation it is clear that if several islands have each their peculiar species of the same genera when these are placed together they will have a wide range of character but there is not space in this work to enter on this curious subject before concluding my account of the zoology of these islands i must describe more in detail the tameness of the birds this disposition is common to all the terrestrial species namely to the mockingbirds the finches sylvicol√¶ tyrantflycatchers doves and hawks there is not one which will not approach sufficiently near to be killed with a switch and sometimes as i have myself tried with a cap or hat a gun is here almost superfluous for with the muzzle of one i pushed a hawk off the branch of a tree one day a mockingbird alighted on the edge of a pitcher made of the shell of a tortoise which i held in my hand whilst lying down it began very quietly to sip the water and allowed me to lift it with the vessel from the ground i often tried and very nearly succeeded in catching these birds by their legs formerly the birds appear to have been even tamer than at present cowley in the year says that the turtledoves were so tame that they would often alight upon our hats and arms so as that we could take them alive they not fearing man until such time as some of our company did fire at them whereby they were rendered more shy dampier in the same year also says that a man in a mornings walk might kill six or seven dozen of these birds at present although certainly very tame they do not alight on peoples arms nor do they suffer themselves to be killed in such numbers it is surprising that the change has not been greater for these islands during the last hundred and fifty years have been frequently visited by bucaniers and whalers and the sailors wandering through the woods in search of tortoises always take delight in knocking down the little birds these birds although much persecuted do not become wild in a short time in charles island which had then been colonized about six years i saw a boy sitting by a well with a switch in his hand with which he killed the doves and finches as they came to drink he had already procured a little heap of them for his dinner and he said he had constantly been in the habit of waiting there for the same purpose we must conclude that the birds not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous animal than the tortoise or the amblyrhyncus disregard us in the same manner as magpies in england do the cows and horses grazing in the fields the falkland islands offer a second instance of this disposition among its birds the extraordinary tameness of the darkcoloured furnarius has been remarked by pernety lesson and other voyagers it is not however peculiar to that bird the caracara snipe upland and lowland goose thrush emberiza and even some true hawks are all more or less tame both hawks and foxes are present and as the birds are so tame we may infer that the absence of all rapacious animals at the galapagos is not the cause of their tameness there the geese at the falklands by the precaution they take in building on the islets show that they are aware of their danger from the foxes but they are not by this rendered wild towards man this tameness of the birds especially the waterfowl is strongly contrasted with the habits of the same species in tierra del fuego where for ages past they have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants in the falklands the sportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day than he is able to carry home whereas in tierra del fuego it is nearly as difficult to kill one as it is in england of the common wild species in the time of pernety all the birds appear to have been much tamer than at present pernety states that the furnarius would almost perch on his finger and that with a wand he killed ten in half an hour at that period the birds must have been about as tame as they now are at the galapagos they appear to have learnt caution more quickly at the falklands than at the latter place and they have had proportionate means of experience for besides frequent visits from vessels the islands have been at intervals colonized during the whole period even formerly when all the birds were so tame by pernetys account it was impossible to kill the blacknecked swan it is rather an interesting fact that this is a bird of passage and therefore brings with it the wisdom learnt in foreign countries i have not met with any account of the land birds being so tame in any other quarter of the world as at the galapagos and falkland islands and it may be observed that of the few archipelagoes of any size which when discovered were uninhabited by man these two are among the most important from the foregoing statements we may i think conclude first that the wildness of birds with regard to man is a particular instinct directed against him and not dependent on any general degree of caution arising from other sources of danger secondly that it is not acquired by them in a short time even when much persecuted but that in the course of successive generations it becomes hereditary with domesticated animals we are accustomed to see instincts becoming hereditary but with those in a state of nature it is more rare to discover instances of such acquired knowledge in regard to the wildness of birds towards men there is no other way of accounting for it few young birds in england have been injured by man yet all are afraid of him many individuals on the other hand both at the galapagos and at the falklands have been injured but yet have not learned that salutary dread we may infer from these facts what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must cause in a country before the instincts of the aborigines become adapted to the strangers craft or power chapter xx tahiti aspect vegetation on the slope of the mountains view of eimeo excursion in the interior profound

waimate missionary establishment english weeds now run wild waiomio funeral service sail from new zealand tahiti and new zealand october ththe survey of the galapagos archipelago being concluded a course was steered towards tahiti and we commenced our long passage of miles in the course of a few days we sailed out of the gloomy and clouded region which extends during the winter far from the coast of south america we then enjoyed bright and clear weather while running pleasantly along at the rate of or miles a day before a steady tradewind the temperature in this more central part of the pacific is higher than near the american shore the thermometer in the poop cabin both by night and day ranged between and which to my feelings was quite delightful but with one degree higher the effect became oppressive we passed through the dangerous or low archipelago and saw several of those most curious rings of land just rising above the edge of the water which have been called lagoon islands a long and brilliantlywhite beach is capped by a margin of green vegetation and this strip appears on both hands rapidly to narrow away in the distance and then sinks beneath the horizon from the masthead a wide expanse of smooth water can be seen within the annular margin of land these low islands bear no proportion to the vast ocean out of which they abruptly rise and it seems wonderful that such weak intruders are not overwhelmed by the allpowerful and nevertiring waves of that great sea miscalled the pacific november that daylight tahiti an island which must for ever remain as classical to the voyager in the south sea was in view at this distance the appearance was not very inviting the luxuriant vegetation of the lower parts was not discernible and as the clouds rolled past the wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards the centre of the island as soon as we came to an anchor in matavai bay we were surrounded by canoes this was our sunday but the monday of tahiti if the case had been reversed we should not have received a single visit for the injunction not to launch a canoe on the sabbath is rigidly obeyed after dinner we landed to enjoy all the delights of the first impressions produced by a new country and that country the charming tahiti a crowd of men women and children was collected on the memorable point venus ready to receive us with laughing merry faces they marshalled us towards the house of mr wilson the missionary of the district who met us on the road and gave us a very friendly reception after sitting a short time in his house we separated to walk about but returned there in the evening the land capable of cultivation is scarcely in any part more than a fringe of low alluvial soil accumulated round the base of the mountains and protected from the waves of the sea by a coral reef which encircles at a distance the entire line of coast the reef is broken in several parts so that ships can pass through and the lake of smooth water within thus affords a safe harbour as well as a channel for the native canoes the low land which comes down to the beach of coral sand is covered by the most beautiful productions of the intertropical regions in the midst of bananas orange cocoanut and breadfruit trees spots are cleared where yams sweet potatoes sugarcane and pineapples are cultivated even the brushwood is a fruittree namely the guava which from its abundance is as noxious as a weed in brazil i have often admired the contrast of varied beauty in the banana palm and orange tree here we have in addition the breadfruit conspicuous from its large glossy and deeply digitated leaf it is admirable to behold groves of a tree sending forth its branches with the force of an english oak loaded with large and most nutritious fruit however little on most occasions utility explains the delight received from any fine prospect in this case it cannot fail to enter as an element in the feeling the little winding paths cool from the surrounding shade led to the scattered houses and the owners of these every where gave us a cheerful and most hospitable reception i was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants there is a mildness in the expression of their countenances which at once banishes the idea of a savage and an intelligence which shows they are advancing in civilization their dress is as yet incongruous no settled costume having taken the place of the ancient one but even in its present state it is far from being so ridiculous as it has been described by travellers of a few years standing those who can afford it wear a white shirt and sometimes a jacket with a wrapper of coloured cotton round their middles thus making a short petticoat like the chilipa of the gauchos this dress appears so general with the chiefs that it will probably become the settled fashion no one even to the queen wears shoes or stockings and only the chiefs have a straw hat on their heads the common people when working keep the upper part of their bodies uncovered and it is then that the tahitians are seen to advantage they are very tall broadshouldered athletic and with wellproportioned limbs it has been somewhere remarked that it requires little habit to make a darker tint of the skin more pleasing and natural even to the eye of an european than his own colour to see a white man bathing by the side of a tahitian was like comparing a plant bleached by the gardeners art with one growing in the open fields most of the men are tattooed and the ornaments follow the curvature of the body so gracefully that they have a very pleasing and elegant effect one common figure varying only in its detail branches somewhat like a tuft of palmleaves from the line of the backbone and curls round each side the simile may be a fanciful one but i thought the body of a man thus ornamented was like the trunk of a noble tree embraced by a delicate creeper many of the older people had their feet covered with small figures placed in order so as to resemble a sock this fashion however is partly gone by and has been succeeded by others here although each man must for ever abide by the whim which reigned in his early days yet fashion is far from immutable an old man has thus his age for ever stamped on his body and he cannot assume the airs of a young dandy the women are also tattooed in the same manner as the men and very commonly on their fingers an unbecoming fashion in one respect is now almost universal it is that of cutting the hair or rather shaving it from the upper part of the head in a circular form so as to leave only an outer ring of hair the missionaries have tried to persuade the people to change this habit but it is the fashion and that is sufficient answer at tahiti as well as at paris i was much disappointed in the personal appearance of the women they are far inferior in every respect to the men the custom of wearing a flower in the back of the head or through a small hole in each ear is pretty the flower is generally either white or scarlet and like the camelia japonica they wear also a sort of crown of woven cocoanut leaves as a shade to their eyes the women appear to be in greater want of some becoming costume even than the men nearly all understand a little english that is they know the names of common things and by the aid of this together with signs a lame sort of conversation could be carried on in returning in the evening to the boat we stopped to witness a very pretty scene numbers of children were playing on the beach and had lighted bonfires which illuminated the placid sea and surrounding trees others in circles were singing tahitian verses we seated ourselves on the sand and joined their party the songs were impromptu and i believe related to our arrival one little girl sang a line which the rest took up in parts forming a very pretty chorus the whole scene made us unequivocally aware that we were seated on the shores of an island in the south sea november ththis day is reckoned in the logbook as tuesday the th instead of monday the th owing to our so far successful chase of the sun before breakfast the ship was hemmed in by a flotilla of canoes and when the natives were allowed to come on board i suppose their numbers could not have been under two hundred it was the opinion of every one that it would have been difficult to have picked out an equal number from any other nation who would have given so little trouble every body brought something for sale shells were the main article of trade the tahitians now fully understand the value of money and prefer it to old clothes or other articles the various coins however of english and spanish denomination puzzle them and they never seemed to think the small silver quite secure until changed into dollars some of the chiefs have accumulated considerable sums of money one not long since offered eight hundred dollars about pounds sterling for a small vessel and frequently they purchase whaleboats and horses at the rate of from fifty to a hundred dollars after breakfast i went on shore and ascended the slope of the nearest part of the mountain to an elevation between two and three thousand feet the form of the land is rather singular and may be understood by explaining its hypothetical origin i believe the interior mountains once stood as a smaller island in the sea and that around their steep flanks streams of lava and beds of sediment were accumulated under water in a conical mass this after being raised has been cut by numerous profound ravines which all diverge from the common centre the intervening ridges being flattopped and belonging to one slope having crossed the narrow girt of inhabited and fertile land i followed the line of one of these ridges having on each hand very steep and smoothsided valleys the vegetation is singular consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf ferns which higher up are mingled with coarse grass the appearance was not very dissimilar from that on some of the welsh hills and this being so close above the orchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising at the highest point which i reached trees again appeared of these three zones of comparative luxuriance the lower one owes its moisture and therefore fertility to its extreme flatness for being scarcely raised above the level of the sea the water which it receives from the higher land drains away slowly the upper zone extends into a moister atmosphere whilst the intermediate part not being benefited by either of these advantages is barren the wood in the upper part was very pretty treeferns having replaced the cocoanuts of the coast it must not however be supposed that these woods at all equal the forests of brazil in an island that vast number of productions which characterizes a continent cannot be expected to occur from the point which i attained there was a good view of the distant island of eimeo dependant on the same sovereign with tahiti on the lofty and broken pinnacles white massive clouds were piled up which formed an island in the blue sky as eimeo itself did in the blue ocean the island with the exception of one small gateway is completely encircled by a reef at this distance a narrow but welldefined line of brilliant white was alone visible where the waves first encountered the wall of coral the glassy water of the lagoon was included within this line and out of it the mountains rose abruptly the effect was very pleasing and might aptly be compared to a framed engraving where the frame represented the breakers the marginal paper the lagoon and the drawing the island itself when in the evening i descended from the mountain a man whom i had pleased with a trifling gift met me bringing with him hot roasted bananas a pineapple and cocoanuts after having walked under a burning sun i do not know any thing more delicious than the milk of a young cocoanut pineapples are here so abundant that the people eat them in the same wasteful manner as we might turnips they are of an excellent flavourperhaps even better than those cultivated in england and this i believe is the highest compliment which can be paid to a fruit or indeed to any thing else before going on board i went to mr wilson who interpreted to the tahitian who had paid me so adroit an attention that i wanted him and another man to accompany me on a short excursion into the mountains november thin the morning i came on shore early bringing with me some provisions in a bag and two blankets for myself and servant these were lashed to each end of a pole and thus carried by my tahitian companions from custom these men are able to walk for a whole day with as much as fifty pounds at each end i told my guides to provide themselves with food and clothing but for the latter they said their skins were sufficient and for the former that there was plenty of food in the mountains the line of march was the valley of tiaauru in which the river flows that enters the sea by point venus this is one of the principal streams in the island and its source lies at the base of the loftiest pinnacles which attain the elevation of about feet the whole island may be considered as one group of mountains so that the only way to penetrate the interior is to follow up the valleys our road at first lay through the wood which bordered each side of the river and the glimpses of the lofty central peaks seen as through an avenue with here and there a waving cocoanut tree on one side were extremely picturesque the valley soon began to narrow and the sides to grow lofty and more precipitous after having walked between three and four hours we found the width of the ravine scarcely exceeded that of the bed of the stream on each hand the walls were nearly vertical yet from the soft nature of the volcanic strata trees and a rank vegetation sprung from every projecting ledge these precipices must have been some thousand feet high and the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than any thing which i had ever before beheld until the midday sun stood vertically over the ravine the air had felt cool and damp but now it became very sultry shaded by a ledge of rock beneath a fa√ßade of columnar lava we ate our dinner my guides had already procured a dish of small fish and freshwater prawns they carried with them a small net stretched on a hoop and where the water was deep and in eddies they dived and like otters by their eyesight followed the fish into holes and corners and thus secured them the tahitians have the dexterity of amphibious animals in the water an anecdote mentioned by ellis shows how much they feel at home in that element when a horse was landing for pomarre in the slings broke and it fell into the water immediately the natives jumped overboard and by their cries and vain efforts at assistance almost drowned the animal as soon however as it reached the shore the whole population took to flight and tried to hide themselves from the mancarryingpig as they christened the horse a little higher up the river divided itself into three little streams the two northern ones were impracticable owing to a succession of waterfalls which descended from the jagged summit of the highest mountain the other to all appearance was equally inaccessible but we managed to ascend it by a most extraordinary road the sides of the valley were here nearly precipitous but as frequently happens with stratified rocks small ledges projected which were thickly covered by wild bananas liliaceous plants and other luxuriant productions of the tropics the tahitians by climbing amongst these ledges searching for fruit had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be scaled the first ascent from the valley was very dangerous for it was necessary to pass the face of a naked rock by the aid of ropes which we brought with us how any person discovered that this formidable spot was the only point where the side of the mountain was practicable i cannot imagine we then cautiously walked along one of the ledges till we came to the stream already alluded to this ledge formed a flat spot above which a beautiful cascade of some hundred feet poured down its waters and beneath it another high one emptied itself into the main stream from this cool and shady recess we made a circuit to avoid the overhanging cascade as before we followed little projecting ledges the apparent danger being partly hidden by the thickness of the vegetation in passing from one of the ledges to another there was a vertical wall of rock one of the tahitians a fine active man placed the trunk of a tree against this climbed up it and then by the aid of crevices reached the summit he fixed the ropes to a projecting point and lowered them for us then hauled up a dog which accompanied us and lastly our luggage beneath the ledge on which the dead tree was placed the precipice must have been five or six hundred feet deep and if the abyss had not been partly concealed by the overhanging ferns and lilies my head would have turned giddy and nothing should have induced me to have attempted it we continued to ascend sometimes along ledges and sometimes along knifeedged ridges having on each hand profound ravines in the cordillera i have seen mountains on a far grander scale but for abruptness no part of them at all comparable to this in the evening we reached a flat little spot on the banks of the same stream which i have mentioned as descending by a chain of waterfalls here we bivouacked for the night on each side of the ravine there were great beds of the fey√© or mountainbanana covered with ripe fruit many of these plants were from twenty to twentyfive feet high and from three to four in circumference by the aid of strips of bark for twine the stems of bamboos for rafters and the large leaf of the banana for a thatch the tahitians in a few minutes built an excellent house and with the withered leaves made a soft bed they then proceeded to make a fire and cook our evening meal a light was procured by rubbing a bluntpointed stick in a groove made in another as if with the intention of deepening it until by friction the dust became ignited a peculiarly white and very light wood the hibiscus tiliaceus is alone used for this purpose it is the same which serves for poles to carry any burden and for the floating outrigger to steady the canoe the fire was produced in a few seconds but to a person who does not understand the art it requires the greatest exertion as i found before at last to my great pride i succeeded in igniting the dust the gaucho in the pampas uses a different method taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long he presses one end on his breast and the other which is pointed in a hole in a piece of wood and then rapidly turns the curved part like a carpenters centrebit the tahitians having made a small fire of sticks placed a score of stones of about the size of cricketballs on the burning wood in about ten minutes time the sticks were consumed and the stones hot they had previously folded up in small parcels of leaves pieces of beef fish ripe and unripe bananas and the tops of the wild arum these green parcels were laid in a layer between two layers of the hot stones and the whole then covered up with earth so that no smoke or steam could escape in about a quarter of an hour the whole was most deliciously cooked the choice green parcels were now laid on a cloth of bananaleaves and with a cocoanut shell we drank the cool water of the running stream and thus we enjoyed our rustic meal i could not look on the surrounding plants without admiration on every side were forests of banana the fruit of which though serving for food in various ways lay in heaps decaying on the ground in front of us there was an extensive brake of wild sugarcane and the stream was shaded by the dark green knotted stem of the avaso famous in former days for its powerful intoxicating effects i chewed a piece and found that it had an acrid and unpleasant taste which would have induced any one at once to have pronounced it poisonous thanks be to the missionaries this plant now thrives only in these deep ravines innocuous to every one close by i saw the wild arum the roots of which when well baked are good to eat and the young leaves better than spinach there was the wild yam and a liliaceous plant called ti which grows in abundance and has a soft brown root in shape and size like a huge log of wood this served us for dessert for it is as sweet as treacle and with a pleasant taste there were moreover several other wild fruits and useful vegetables the little stream besides its cool water produced eels and crayfish i did indeed admire this scene when i compared it with an uncultivated one in the temperate zones i felt the force of the observation that man at least savage man with his reasoning powers only partly developed is the child of the tropics as the evening drew to a close i strolled beneath the gloomy shade of the bananas up the course of the stream my walk was soon brought to a close by coming to a waterfall between two and three hundred feet high and again above this there was another i mention all these waterfalls in this one brook to give a general idea of the inclination of the land in the little recess where the water fell it did not appear that a breath of wind had ever entered the leaves of the banana damp with spray possessed an unbroken edge instead of being split as generally is the case into a thousand shreds from our position almost suspended on the mountainside there were glimpses into the depths of the neighbouring valleys and the lofty points of the central mountains towering up within sixty degrees of the zenith hid half the evening sky thus seated it was a sublime spectacle to watch the shades of night gradually obscuring the last and highest pinnacles before we laid ourselves down to sleep the elder tahitian fell on his knees and with closed eyes repeated a long prayer in his native tongue he prayed as a christian should do with fitting reverence and without the fear of ridicule or any ostentation of piety at our meals neither of the men would taste food without saying beforehand a short grace those travellers who think that a tahitian prays only when the eyes of the missionary are fixed on him should have slept with us that night on the mountainside before morning it rained very heavily but the good thatch of bananaleaves kept us dry november th at daylight my friends after their morning prayer prepared an excellent breakfast in the same manner as in the evening they themselves certainly partook of it largely indeed i never saw any men eat nearly so much i should suppose such capacious stomachs must be the result of a large part of their diet consisting of fruit and vegetables which contain in a given bulk a comparatively small portion of nutriment unwittingly i was the means of my companions breaking as i afterwards learned one of their own laws and resolutions i took with me a flask of spirits which they could not resolve to refuse but as often as they drank a little they put their fingers before their mouths and uttered the word missionary about two years ago although the use of the ava was prevented drunkenness from the introduction of spirits became very prevalent the missionaries prevailed on a few good men who saw their country rapidly going to ruin to join with them in a temperance society from good sense or shame all the chiefs and the queen were at last persuaded to join it immediately a law was passed that no spirits should be allowed to be introduced into the island and that he who sold and he who bought the forbidden article should be punished by a fine with remarkable justice a certain period was allowed for stock in hand to be sold before the law came into effect but when it did a general search was made in which even the houses of the missionaries were not exempted and all the ava as the natives call all ardent spirits was poured on the ground when one reflects on the effect of intemperance on the aborigines of the two americas i think it will be acknowledged that every wellwisher of tahiti owes no common debt of gratitude to the missionaries as long as the little island of st helena remained under the government of the east india company spirits owing to the great injury they had produced were not allowed to be imported but wine was supplied from the cape of good hope it is rather a striking and not very gratifying fact that in the same year that spirits were allowed to be sold on that island their use was banished from tahiti by the free will of the people after breakfast we proceeded on our journey as my object was merely to see a little of the interior scenery we returned by another track which descended into the main valley lower down for some distance we wound by a most intricate path along the side of the mountain which formed the valley in the less precipitous parts we passed through extensive groves of the wild banana the tahitians with their naked tattooed bodies their heads ornamented with flowers and seen in the dark shade of the woods would have formed a fine picture of man inhabiting some primeval forest in our descent we followed the line of ridges these were exceedingly narrow and for considerable lengths steep as a ladder but all clothed with vegetation the extreme care necessary in poising each step rendered the walk fatiguing i am never weary of expressing my astonishment at these ravines and precipices the mountains may almost be described as rent by so many crevices when viewing the surrounding country from the knifeedged ridges the point of support was so small that the effect was nearly the same i should think as from a balloon in this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once at the point where we entered the main valley we slept under the same ledge of rock where the day before we had dined the night was fine but from the depth and narrowness of the gorge profoundly dark before actually seeing this country i had difficulty in understanding two facts mentioned by ellis namely that after the murderous battles of former times the survivors on the conquered side retired into the mountains where a handful of men could resist a multitude certainly halfadozen men at the spot where the tahitian reared the old tree could easily have repulsed thousands secondly that after the introduction of christianity there were wild men who lived in the mountains and whose retreats were unknown to the more civilized inhabitants november thin the morning we started early and reached matavai at noon on the road we met a large party of noble athletic men going for wild bananas i found that the ship on account of the difficulty in watering had moved to the harbour of papawa to which place i immediately walked this is a very pretty spot the cove is surrounded by reefs and the water as smooth as that in a lake the cultivated ground with all its beautiful productions and the cottages comes close down to the waters edge from the varying accounts which i had read before reaching these islands i was very anxious to form from my own observation a judgment of their moral statealthough such judgment would necessarily be very imperfect a first impression at all times very much depends on ones previouslyacquired ideas my notions were drawn from elliss polynesian researchesan admirable and most interesting work but naturally looking at every thing under a favourable point of view from beecheys voyage and from that of kotzebue which is strongly adverse to the whole missionary system he who compares these three accounts will i think form a tolerably accurate conception of the present state of tahiti one of my impressions which i took from the two last authorities was decidedly incorrect viz that the tahitians had become a gloomy race and lived in fear of the missionaries of the latter feeling i saw no trace unless indeed fear and respect be confounded under one name instead of discontent being a common feeling it would be difficult in europe to pick out of a crowd half so many merry and happy faces the prohibition of the flute and dancing is inveighed against as wrong and foolishthe more than presbyterian manner of keeping the sabbath is looked at in a similar light on these points i will not pretend to offer any opinion in opposition to men who have resided as many years as i was days on the island on the whole it appears to me that the morality and religion of the inhabitants is highly creditable there are many who attack even more acrimoniously than kotzebue both the missionaries their system and the effects produced by it such reasoners never compare the present state with that of the island only twenty years ago nor even with that of europe at this day but they compare it with the high standard of gospel perfection they expect the missionaries to effect that which the apostles themselves failed to do in as much as the condition of the people falls short of this high order blame is attached to the missionary instead of credit for that which he has effected they forget or will not remember that human sacrifices and the power of an idolatrous priesthooda system of profligacy unparalleled in the world and infanticide a consequence on that systembloody wars where the conquerors spared neither women nor children that all these have been abolished and that dishonesty intemperance and licentiousness have been greatly reduced by the introduction of christianity in a voyager to forget these things is base ingratitude for should he chance to be at the point of shipwreck on some unknown coast he will most devoutly pray that the lesson of the missionary may be found to have extended thus far in point of morality the virtue of the women it has been often said is most open to exception but before they are blamed too severely it will be well distinctly to call to mind the scenes described by captain cook and mr banks in which the grandmothers and mothers of the present race played a part those who are most severe should consider how much of the morality of the women in europe is owing to the system early impressed by mothers on their daughters and how much in each individual case to the precepts of religion but it is useless to argue against such reasoners i believe that disappointed in not finding the field of licentiousness quite so open as formerly they will not give credit to a morality which they do not wish to practice or to a religion which they undervalue if not despise sunday dthe harbour of papiete which may be considered as the capital of the island is about seven miles distant from matavai to which point the beagle had returned the queen resides there and it is the seat of government and the chief resort of shipping captain fitzroy took a party there to hear divine service first in the tahitian language and afterwards in our own mr pritchard the leading missionary in the island performed the service which was a most interesting spectacle the chapel consisted of a large airy framework of wood and it was filled to excess by tidy clean people of all ages and both sexes i was rather disappointed in the apparent degree of attention but i believe my expectations were raised too high at all events the appearance was quite equal to that in a country church in england the singing of the hymns was decidedly very pleasing but the language from the pulpit although fluently delivered did not sound well a constant repetition of words like tata ta mata mai rendered it monotonous after english service a party returned on foot to matavai it was a pleasant walk sometimes along the seabeach and sometimes under the shade of the many beautiful trees about two years ago a small vessel under english colours was plundered by the inhabitants of the low islands which were then under the dominion of the queen of tahiti it was believed that the perpetrators were instigated to this act by some indiscreet laws issued by her majesty the british government demanded compensation which was acceded to and a sum of nearly three thousand dollars was agreed to be paid on the first of last september the commodore at lima ordered captain fitzroy to inquire concerning this debt and to demand satisfaction if it were not paid captain fitzroy accordingly requested an interview with the queen and a parliament was held to consider the question at which all the principal chiefs of the island and the queen were assembled i will not attempt to describe what took place after the interesting account given by captain fitzroy the money it appeared had not been paid perhaps the alleged reasons for the failure were rather equivocating but otherwise i cannot sufficiently express our general surprise at the extreme good sense the reasoning powers moderation candour and prompt resolution which were displayed on all sides i believe every one of us left the meeting with a very different opinion of the tahitians from that which we entertained when entering the chiefs and people resolved to subscribe and complete the sum which was wanting captain fitzroy urged that it was hard that their private property should be sacrificed for the crimes of distant islanders they replied that they were grateful for his consideration but that pomarre was their queen and they were determined to help her in this her difficulty this resolution and its prompt execution for a book was opened early the next morning made a perfect conclusion to this very remarkable scene of loyalty and good feeling after the main discussion was ended several of the chiefs took the opportunity of asking captain fitzroy many intelligent questions concerning international customs and laws these related to the treatment of ships and foreigners on some points as soon as the decision was made the law was issued verbally on the spot this tahitian parliament lasted for several hours and when it was over captain fitzroy invited the queen to pay the beagle a visit november thin the evening with a gentle landbreeze a course was steered for new zealand and as the sun set we took a farewell look at the mountains of tahitithe island to which every voyager has offered up his tribute of admiration december thin the evening we saw new zealand in the distance we may now consider ourselves as having nearly crossed the pacific ocean it is necessary to sail over this great sea to understand its immensity moving quickly onwards for weeks together we meet with nothing but the same blue profoundly deep ocean even within the archipelagoes the islands are mere specks and far distant one from the other accustomed to look at maps drawn on a small scale where dots shading and names are crowded together we do not judge rightly how infinitely small the proportion of dry land is to the water of this great sea the meridian of the antipodes likewise has now been passed and every league thanks to our good fortune which we travel onwards is one league nearer to england these antipodes call to mind old recollections of childish doubt and wonder only the other day i looked forward to this airy barrier as a definite point in our voyage homewards but now i find it and all such restingplaces for the imagination are like shadows which a man moving onwards cannot catch a gale of wind which lasted for some days has lately given us time and inclination to measure the future stages in our long voyage and to wish most earnestly for its termination december stearly in the morning we entered the bay of islands and being becalmed for some hours near the mouth we did not reach the anchorage till the middle of the day the country is hilly but with a smooth outline and it is deeply intersected by numerous arms extending from the bay the surface appears from a distance as if clothed with coarse pasture but this in truth is nothing but fern on the more distant hills as well as in patches in some of the valleys there is a good deal of woodland the general tint of the landscape is not a bright green and it resembles the country a short distance to the southward of concepcion in chile in several parts of the bay little villages of square tidylooking houses were scattered close down to the waters edge three whaling ships were lying at anchor but with the exception of these and of a few canoes now and then crossing from one shore to the other an air of extreme quietness reigned over the whole district only a single canoe came alongside this and the aspect of the whole scene afforded a remarkable and not very pleasing contrast with our joyful and boisterous welcome at tahiti in the afternoon we went on shore to one of the larger groups of houses which yet hardly deserves the title of a village its name is pahia it is the residence of the missionaries and with the exception of their servants and labourers there are no native residents in the vicinity of the bay of islands the number of englishmen including their families amounts to between two and three hundred all the cottages many of which are white washed and look as i have said very neat are the property of the english the hovels of the natives are so diminutive and paltry that they can scarcely be perceived from any distance at pahia it was quite pleasing to behold the english flowers in the platforms before the houses there were roses of several kinds honeysuckle jasmine stocks and whole hedges of sweetbriar december din the morning i went out walking but i soon found that the country was very impracticable all the hills are thickly covered by tall fern together with a low bush which grows like a cypress and very little ground has been cleared or cultivated in this neighbourhood i then tried the seabeach but proceeding towards either hand my walk was soon stopped short by creeks and deep streams of fresh water the communication between the inhabitants of the different parts of the bay is as in chiloe almost entirely kept up by boats i was surprised to find that almost every hill which i ascended had been at some former time more or less fortified the summits were cut into steps or successive terraces and they had been frequently protected by deep trenches i afterwards observed that the principal hills inland in like manner showed an artificial outline these are the pas so frequently mentioned by captain cook under the name of hippah the difference of sound being owing to the prefixed article that the pas had formerly been used was evident from the piles of shells and the pits in which as i was informed sweet potatoes were kept as reserved provisions as there was no water on these hills the defenders could never have anticipated a long siege but only a hurried attack for plunder under which circumstances the successive terraces would have afforded good protection the general introduction of firearms has changed the whole system of warfare and an exposed situation on the top of a hill would now be worse than useless the pas in consequence is at the present day always built on a level piece of ground it consists of a double stockade of thick and tall posts placed in a zigzag line so that every part can be flanked within the stockade a mound of earth is thrown up behind which the defenders can rest in safety or use their firearms over it on the level of the ground little archways sometimes pass through this breastwork by which means the defenders can crawl out to the stockade to reconnoitre their enemies the rev w williams who gave me this account added that in one pas he had noticed spurs or buttresses projecting from the inside of the mound of earth on asking the chief the use of them he replied that if two or three of his men should be shot their neighbours would not see the bodies and so be discouraged these pases are considered by the new zealanders as very perfect means of defence for the attacking force is never so well disciplined as to rush in a body to the stockade cut it down and effect their entry when a tribe goes to war the chief cannot order one party to go here and another there but every man fights in the manner which best pleases himself and for individuals to approach a stockade defended by firearms must appear certain death i should think a more warlike race of inhabitants could not be found in any part of the world than the new zealanders their conduct on first seeing a ship as described by captain cook strongly illustrates this the act of throwing volleys of stones at so great and novel an object and their defiance of come on shore and we will kill and eat you all shows uncommon boldness this warlike spirit is evident in many of their customs and even in their smallest actions if a new zealander is struck although but in joke the blow must be returned and of this i saw an instance with one of our officers at the present day from the progress of civilization there is much less warfare when europeans first traded here muskets and ammunition far exceeded in value any other article now they are in little request and are indeed often offered for sale among some of the southern tribes however there is still much hostility i heard a characteristic anecdote of what took place there some time ago a missionary found a chief and his tribe in preparation for wartheir muskets clean and bright and their ammunition ready he reasoned long on the inutility of the war and the little provocation which had been given for it the chief was much shaken in his resolution and seemed in doubt but at length it occurred to him that a barrel of his gunpowder was in a bad state and that it would not keep much longer this was brought forward as an unanswerable argument for the necessity of immediately declaring war the idea of allowing so much good gunpowder to spoil was not to be thought of and this settled the point i was told by the missionaries that in the life of shongi the chief who visited england the love of war was the one and lasting spring of every action the tribe in which he was a principal chief had at one time been much oppressed by another from the thames river a solemn oath was taken by the men that when their boys should grow up and they should be powerful enough they would never forget or forgive these injuries to fulfil this appears to have been shongis chief motive for going to england and when there it was his sole object presents were valued only as they could be converted into arms of the arts those alone were interesting which were concerned with the manufacture of arms when at sydney shongi by a strange coincidence met the hostile chief of the thames river at the house of mr marsden their conduct was civil to each other but shongi told him that when again in new zealand he would never cease to carry war into his country the challenge was accepted and shongi on his return fulfilled the threat to the utmost letter the tribe on the thames river was utterly overthrown and the chief to whom the challenge had been given was himself killed shongi although harbouring such deep feelings of hatred and revenge is described as having been a goodnatured person in the evening i went with captain fitzroy and mr baker one of the missionaries to pay a visit to kororadika this is the largest village and will one day no doubt increase till it becomes the chief town besides a considerable native population there are many english residents these latter are men of the most worthless character and among them are many runaway convicts from new south wales there are many spiritshops and the whole population is addicted to drunkenness and all kinds of vice as this is the capital a person would be inclined to form his opinion of the new zealanders from what he here saw but in this case his estimate of their character would be too low this little village is the very stronghold of vice although many tribes in other parts have embraced christianity here the greater part yet remain in heathenism in such places the missionaries are held in little esteem but they complain far more of the conduct of their countrymen than of that of the natives it is strange but i have heard these worthy men say that the only protection which they need and on which they rely is from the native chiefs against englishmen we wandered about the village and saw and conversed with many of the people both men women and children looking at the new zealander one naturally compares him with the tahitian both belonging to the same family of mankind the comparison however tells heavily against the new zealander he may perhaps be superior in energy but in every other respect his character is of a much lower order one glance at their respective expressions brings conviction to the mind that one is a savage the other a civilized man it would be vain to seek in the whole of new zealand a person with the face and mien of the old tahitian chief utamme no doubt the extraordinary manner in which tattooing is here practised gives a disagreeable expression to their countenances the complicated but symmetrical figures covering the whole face puzzle and mislead an unaccustomed eye it is moreover probable that the deep incisions by destroying the play of the superficial muscles give an air of rigid inflexibility but besides this there is a twinkling in the eye which cannot indicate any thing but cunning and ferocity their figures are tall and bulky but in elegance are not comparable with those of the working classes in tahiti both their persons and houses are filthily dirty and offensive the idea of washing either their bodies or their clothes never seems to enter their heads i saw a chief who was wearing a shirt black and matted with filth and when asked how it came to be so dirty he replied with surprise do not you see it is an old one some of the men have shirts but the common dress is one or two large blankets generally black with dirt which are thrown over their shoulders in a very inconvenient and awkward fashion a few of the principal chiefs have decent suits of english clothes but these are only worn on great occasions considering the number of foreigners residing in new zealand and the amount of commerce carried on there the state of government of the country is most remarkable it is however incorrect to use the
