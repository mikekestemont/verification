such as tarapaca where the inhabitants having more water are enabled to irrigate some little land and produce hay on which the mules and asses employed in carrying the saltpetre are fed the nitrate of soda is sold at the ships side at fourteen shillings per hundred pounds the chief expense is the transport to the seacoast the mine itself consists of a stratum between two and three feet thick of the hard and nearly pure salt lying close beneath the surface the stratum follows the margin of a grand basin or plain which manifestly must once have been either a lake or inland sea the elevation at present is feet above the level of the pacific on our return we made a detour by the mines of guantajaya the village consists solely of the houses of the miners and the place is utterly destitute of every necessaryeven water being brought thirty miles on the backs of animals at present the mines yield little though formerly they were very productive one has a depth of four hundred yards and out of it masses of silver were taken so pure that it was only required to melt them in order to run them into bars we reached iquique after sunset i went on board and then the beagle weighed for lima i was very glad to have seen this place as i understand it is a good type of the greater part of the coast of peru july thwe anchored in the bay of callao the seaport of lima the capital of peru we staid here six weeks but from the troubled state of public affairs i saw very little of the country during our whole visit the climate was far from being so delightful as it is generally represented a dull heavy bank of clouds constantly hung over the land so that during the first sixteen days i had only one view of the cordillera behind lima these mountains seen in stages one above the other through openings in the clouds had a very grand appearance it has almost become a proverb that rain never falls in the lower part of peru yet this can hardly be considered correct for during almost every day of our visit there was a thick drizzling mist which was sufficient to make the streets muddy and ones clothes damp this the people are pleased to call peruvian dew that much rain does not fall is very certain for the houses are covered only with flat roofs made of hardened mud and on the mole shiploads of wheat were piled up and are thus left for weeks together without any shelter i cannot say i liked the very little i saw of peru in summer however it is said that the climate is much pleasanter in all seasons both inhabitants and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague this disease is common on the whole coast of peru but is unknown in the interior the attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to appear most mysterious so difficult is it to judge from the aspect of a country whether or not it is healthy that if a person had been told to choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for health very probably he would have named this coast the plain round the outskirts of callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass and in some parts there are a few stagnant though very small pools of water the miasma in all probability arises from these for the town of arica was similarly circumstanced and its healthiness was much improved by the drainage of the water the miasma is not always produced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate for many parts of brazil even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation are much more healthy than this sterile coast of peru the densest forests in a temperate climate as in chiloe do not seem in the slightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere the island of st jago at the cape de verds offers another stronglymarked instance of a country which any one would have expected to find most healthy being very much the contrary i have described the bare and open plains as supporting during a few weeks after the rainy season a thin vegetation which directly withers away and dries up at that period the air appears to become poisonous both natives and foreigners often becoming affected with violent fevers on the other hand the galapagos archipelago in the pacific with a similar soil and periodically subject to the same process of vegetation is perfectly healthy humboldt has observed that under the torrid zone the smallest marshes are the most dangerous being surrounded as at vera cruz and carthagena with an arid and sandy soil which raises the temperature of the ambient air i must observe however that on the coast of peru the temperature is not hot to any excessive degree and perhaps in consequence the intermittent fevers are not of the most malignant order in all unhealthy countries the greatest risk is run by sleeping on shore is this owing to the state of the body during sleep or to a greater abundance of miasma at such times it appears certain that those who stay on board a vessel though anchored at only a short distance from the coast generally suffer less than those actually on shore on the other hand i have heard of one remarkable case where a fever broke out among the crew of a manofwar some hundred miles off the coast of africa at the very same time that one of those fearful periods of death commenced at sierra leone it maybe remarked that of the most destructive diseases which bear an evident relation to climate and which as if by the addition of some direct poison affect both natives and strangers nearly all originate in the hotter regions of the earth as geological induction shows that the climate during the periods antecedent to the present had an extratropical character so in all probability there would be an extra tendency to disease and we can therefore see that the introduction of man being as generally supposed recent is an adaptation to the existing condition of the world no state in south america since the declaration of independence has suffered more from anarchy than peru at the time of our visit there were four chiefs in arms contending for supremacy in the government if one succeeded in becoming for a time very powerful the others coalesced against him but no sooner were they victorious than they were again disunited and hostile to each other the other day at the anniversary of the independence high mass was performed the president partaking of the sacrament during the te deum laudamus instead of each regiment displaying the peruvian flag a black one with deaths head was unfurled imagine a government under which such a scene could be ordered on such an occasion to be typical of their determination of fighting to the death this state of affairs happened at a time very unfortunately for me as i was precluded from taking any excursions much beyond the limits of the towns the barren island of s lorenzo which forms the harbour was nearly the only place where one could walk securely the upper part which is about feet in height during this season of the year winter comes within the lower limit of the clouds and in consequence of this an abundant cryptogamic vegetation and a few flowers covered the summit on the hills near lima at an elevation but little greater the ground was carpeted with moss and beds of beautiful yellow lilies called amancaes this indicates a very much greater degree of humidity than at a corresponding altitude at iquique travelling northward the climate becomes damper till on the banks of the guyaquil nearly under the equator we find the most luxuriant forests the change however from the sterile coast of peru to that fertile land is described as taking place rather abruptly in the latitude of cape blanco two degrees south of guyaquil callao is a filthy illbuilt small seaport the inhabitants both there and at lima present every imaginable shade of mixture between european negro and indian blood they appear a depraved drunken set of people the atmosphere was loaded with foul smells and that peculiar one which may be perceived in almost every town within the tropics was here very strong the fortress which withstood lord cochranes long siege has an imposing appearance but the president during our stay sold the brass guns and proceeded to dismantle parts of it the reason assigned was that he had not an officer to whom he could trust so important a charge he himself had good reasons for knowing this as he had obtained the presidentship by rebelling while in charge of this same fortress after we left south america he paid the penalty in the usual way by being conquered taken prisoner and shot lima stands on a plain in a valley formed during the gradual retreat of the sea it is distant seven miles from callao and is elevated feet above it but from the slope being very gradual the road appears absolutely level so that when at lima it is difficult to believe one has ascended some hundred feet humboldt has remarked on this singularly deceptive case steep barren hills rise like islands from the plain which is divided by straight mudwalls into large green fields in these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows and the presence of an occasional clump of bananas and of oranges alone reminded one that the landscape of a country in latitude might have boasted of a far more splendid vegetation the city of lima is now in a wretched state of decay the streets are nearly unpaved and heaps of filth are piled up in all directions where the black gallinazos tame as poultry pick up bits of carrion the houses have generally an upper story built on account of the earthquakes of plastered woodwork but some of the old ones which are now used by several families are immensely large and would rival in suites of apartments the most magnificent in any place lima the city of the kings must formerly have been a splendid town the extraordinary number of churches even at the present day gives it a peculiar and striking character especially when viewed from a short distance one day i went out with some merchants to hunt in the immediate vicinity of the city our sport was very poor but i had an opportunity of seeing the ruins of one of the ancient indian villages with its hilllike mound in the centre the remains of houses enclosures irrigating streams and burial mounds scattered over this plain cannot fail to give one a high idea of the condition and number of the ancient population when their earthenware woollen clothes utensils of elegant forms cut out of the hardest rocks tools of copper ornaments of precious stones palaces and hydraulic works are considered it is impossible not to respect the considerable advance made by them in the arts of civilization the burial mounds called huacas are really stupendous although in some places it is only a natural hill which appears to have been incased and modelled there is also another and very different class of ruins which possesses some interest namely those of old callao overwhelmed by the great earthquake of and its accompanying wave the destruction must have been more complete even than at concepcion quantities of shingle almost conceal the foundations of the walls and vast masses of brickwork appear to have been whirled about by the retiring waves like pebbles it has been stated that the land subsided during this memorable shock i could not discover any proof of this yet it seems far from improbable for the form of the coast must certainly have undergone some change since the foundation of the old town as no people in their senses would willingly have chosen for their building place the narrow spit of shingle on which the ruins now stand on the island of san lorenzo there are very satisfactory proofs of elevation within the recent period this of course would not contravene the belief of a small subsidence if any signs of such movement could be discovered the side of the mountain fronting the bay on that island is worn into three obscure terraces which are covered by masses of shells many hundred tons in weight of species now existing on the beach several of the univalves had serpulæ and small balani attached on their insides proving that they must have remained some time after the animal had died at the bottom of the sea in such cases we may feel sure that they had not been carried up as has sometimes been believed either by birds or men for food when examining the beds of shells which have been raised above the level of the sea on other parts of the coast i often felt curious to trace their final disappearance from decay on the island of san lorenzo this could be done in the most satisfactory manner at a small height the shells were quite perfect on a terrace eightyfive feet above the sea they were partially decomposed and coated by a soft scaly substance at double this altitude a thin layer of calcareous powder beneath the soil without a trace of organic structure was all that could be discovered this highly curious and satisfactory gradation of change it is evident could be traced only under the peculiar conditions of this climate where rain never falls so as to wash away the particles of shells in their last stage of decomposition i was much interested by finding embedded together with pieces of seaweed in the mass of shells in the eightyfive foot bed a bit of cottonthread plaited rush and the head of a stalk of indian corn this fact coupled with another which will be mentioned proves i think the amount of eightyfive feet elevation since man inhabited this part of peru on the coast of patagonia and la plata where perhaps the movements have been slower there is evidence as we have seen that several mammalia have become extinct during a smaller change of level at valparaiso where there exist abundant proofs of recent elevation to a greater altitude than in this part of peru i can show that the greatest possible change during the last years has not exceeded the small measure of fifteen feet on the mainland in front of san lorenzo near bellavista there is an extensive and level plain at the height of about a hundred feet the section on the coast shows that the lower part consists of alternating layers of sand and impure clay together with some gravel and the surface to the depth of from three to six feet of a reddish loam containing a few scattered seashells and numerous small fragments of coarse red earthenware at first i was inclined to believe that this superficial bed must have been deposited beneath the sea but i afterwards found in one spot that it covered an artificial floor of round stones the conclusion which then seemed most probable was that at a period when the land stood at a less height there was a plain very similar to the one now surrounding callao which being protected by a shingle beach is raised but very little above the level of the sea on this plain with its clay beds i imagine the indians manufactured their earthen vessels and that during some violent earthquake the sea broke over the beach and converted the plain into a temporary lake as happened in around callao the water would then deposit mud containing fragments of pottery from the kilns and shells from the sea this bed with fossil earthenware occurring at about the same altitude with the terrace on san lorenzo confirms the supposed amount of elevation within the human period chapter xix islands volcanic number of craters leafless bushes colony at charles island james island saltlake in crater character of vegetation ornithology curious finches great tortoises habits of paths to the wells marine lizard feeds on seaweed terrestrial species burrowing habits herbivorous importance of reptiles in the archipelago few and minute insects american type of organization species confined to certain islands tameness of birds falkland islands fear of man an acquired instinct galapagos archipelago september ththe beagle arrived at the southernmost of the galapagos islands this archipelago consists of ten principal islands of which five much exceed the others in size they are situated under the equatorial line and between five and six hundred miles to the westward of the coast of america the constitution of the whole is volcanic with the exception of some ejected fragments of granite which have been most curiously glazed and altered by the heat every part consists of lava or of sandstone resulting from the attrition of such materials the higher islands which attain an elevation of three and even four thousand feet generally have one or more principal craters towards their centre and on their flanks smaller orifices i have no exact data from which to calculate but i do not hesitate to affirm that there must be in all the islands of the archipelago at least two thousand craters these are of two kinds one as in ordinary cases consisting of scoriæ and lava the other of finelystratified volcanic sandstone the latter in most instances have a form beautifully symmetrical their origin is due to the ejection of mudthat is fine volcanic ashes and waterwithout any lava considering that these islands are placed directly under the equator the climate is far from being excessively hot a circumstance which perhaps is chiefly owing to the singularly low temperature of the surrounding sea excepting during one short season very little rain falls and even then it is not regular but the clouds generally hang low from these circumstances the lower parts of the islands are extremely arid whilst the summits at an elevation of a thousand feet or more possess a tolerably luxuriant vegetation this is especially the case on the windward side which first receives and condenses the moisture from the atmosphere in the morning th we landed on chatham island which like the others rises with a tame and rounded outline interrupted only here and there by scattered hillocksthe remains of former craters nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance a broken field of black basaltic lava is every where covered by astunted brushwood which shows little signs of life the dry and parched surface having been heated by the noonday sun gave the air a close and sultry feeling like that from a stove we fancied even the bushes smelt unpleasantly although i diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible i succeeded in getting only ten kinds and such wretchedlooking little weeds would have better become an arctic than an equatorial flora the thin woods which cover the lower parts of all the islands excepting where the lava has recently flowed appear from a short distance quite leafless like the deciduous trees of the northern hemisphere in winter it was some time before i discovered that not only almost every plant was in full leaf but that the greater number were now in flower after the period of heavy rains the islands are said to appear for a short time partially green the only other country in which i have seen a vegetation with a character at all approaching to this is at the volcanic island of fernando noronha placed in many respects under similar conditions the natural history of this archipelago is very remarkable it seems to be a little world within itself the greater number of its inhabitants both vegetable and animal being found nowhere else as i shall refer to this subject again i will only here remark as forming a striking character on first landing that the birds are strangers to man so tame and unsuspecting were they that they did not even understand what was meant by stones being thrown at them and quite regardless of us they approached so close that any number might have been killed with a stick the beagle sailed round chatham island and anchored in several bays one night i slept on shore on a part of the island where some black conesthe former chimneys of the subterranean heated fluidswere extraordinarily numerous from one small eminence i counted sixty of these truncated hillocks which were all surmounted by a more or less perfect crater the greater number consisted merely of a ring of red scoriæ or slags cemented together and their height above the plain of lava was not more than from fifty to a hundred feet from their regular form they gave the country a workshop appearance which strongly reminded me of those parts of staffordshire where the great ironfoundries are most numerous the age of the various beds of lava was distinctly marked by the comparative growth or entire absence of vegetation nothing can be imagined more rough and horrid than the surface of the more modern streams these have been aptly compared to the sea petrified in its most boisterous moments no sea however would present such irregular undulations or would be traversed by such deep chasms all the craters are in an extinct condition and although the age of the different streams of lava could be so clearly distinguished it is probable they have remained so for many centuries there is no account in any of the old voyagers of any volcano on this island having been seen in activity yet since the time of dampier there must have been some increase in the quantity of vegetation otherwise so accurate a person would not have expressed himself thus four or five of the easternmost islands are rocky barren and hilly producing neither tree herb nor grass but a few dildoe cactus trees except by the seaside this description is at present applicable only to the western islands where the volcanic forces are in frequent activity the day on which i visited the little craters was glowing hot and the scrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets was very fatiguing but i was well repaid by the cyclopian scene in my walk i met two large tortoises each of which must have weighed at least two hundred pounds one was eating a piece of cactus and when i approached it looked at me and then quietly walked away the other gave a deep hiss and drew in its head these huge reptiles surrounded by the black lava the leafless shrubs and large cacti appeared to my fancy like some antediluvian animals september dthe beagle proceeded to charles island this archipelago has long been frequented first by the bucaniers and latterly by whalers but it is only within the last six years that a small colony has been established on it the inhabitants are between two and three hundred in number they nearly all consist of people of colour who have been banished for political crimes from the republic of the equator quito is the capital of this state to which these islands belong the settlement is placed about four and a half miles inland and at an elevation probably of a thousand feet in the first part of the road we passed through leafless thickets as in chatham island higher up the wood gradually became greener and immediately we had crossed the ridge of the island our bodies were cooled by the fine southerly tradewind and our senses refreshed by the sight of a green and thriving vegetation the houses are irregularly scattered over a flat space of ground which is cultivated with sweet potatoes and bananas it will not easily be imagined how pleasant the sight of black mud was to us after having been so long accustomed to the parched soil of peru and chile the inhabitants although complaining of poverty gain without much trouble the means of subsistence from the fertile soil in the woods there are many wild pigs and goats but the main article of animal food is derived from the tortoise their numbers in this island have of course been greatly reduced but the people yet reckon on two days hunting supplying food for the rest of the week it is said that formerly single vessels have taken away as many as seven hundred of these animals and that the ships company of a frigate some years since brought down two hundred to the beach in one day we staid at this island four days during which time i collected many plants and birds one morning i ascended the highest hill which has an altitude of nearly feet the summit consists of a brokendown crater thickly clothed with coarse grass and brushwood even in this one island i counted thirtynine hills each of which was terminated by a more or less perfect circular depression september thwe doubled the southwest extremity of albermarle island and the next day were nearly becalmed between it and narborough island both are covered with immense streams of black naked lava which having either flowed over the rims of the great caldrons or having burst forth from the smaller orifices on the flanks have in their descent spread over miles of the seacoast on both of these islands eruptions are known occasionally to take place and in albermarle we saw a small jet of smoke curling from the summit of one of the more lofty craters in the evening we anchored in banks cove in albermarle island when morning came we found that the harbour in which we were at anchor was formed by a brokendown crater composed of volcanic sandstone after breakfast i went out walking to the southward of this first crater there was another of similar composition and beautifully symmetrical it was elliptic in form the longer axis being less than a mile and its depth about feet the bottom was occupied by a shallow lake and in its centre a tiny crater formed an islet the day was overpoweringly hot and the lake looked clear and blue i hurried down the cindery slope and choked with dust eagerly tasted the waterbut to my sorrow i found it salt as brine the rocks on the coast abounded with great black lizards between three and four feet long and on the hills another species was equally common we saw several of the latter some clumsily running out of our way and others shuffling into their burrows i shall presently describe in more detail the habits of both these reptiles october dwe sailed round the northern end of albermarle island nearly the whole of this side is covered with recent streams of darkcoloured lavas and is studded with craters i should think it would be difficult to find in any other part of the world an island situated within the tropics and of such considerable size namely miles long so sterile and incapable of supporting life on the th we reached james island captain fitzroy put mr bynoe myself and three others on shore leaving with us a tent and provisions to wait there till the vessel returned from watering this was an admirable plan for the collections as we had an entire week of hard work we found here a party of spaniards who had been sent from charles island to dry fish and to salt tortoisemeat at the distance of about six miles and at the height of nearly feet the spaniards had erected a hovel in which two men lived who were employed in catching tortoises whilst the others were fishing on the coast i paid this party two visits and slept there one night in the same manner as in the other islands the lower region is covered by nearly leafless bushes but here many of them grow to the size of trees i measured several which were two feet in diameter and some even two feet nine inches the upper region being kept damp from the moisture of the condensed clouds supports a green and flourishing vegetation so damp was the ground that there were large beds of a coarse carex in which great numbers of a very small waterrail lived and bred while staying in this upper region we lived entirely upon tortoisemeat the breastplate roasted as the gauchos do carne con cuero with the flesh attached to it is very good and the young tortoises make excellent soup but otherwise the meat to my taste is very indifferent during another day we accompanied a party of the spaniards in their whaleboat to a salina or lake from which salt is procured after landing we had a very rough walk over a rugged field of recent lava which has almost surrounded a sandstone crater at the bottom of which the saltlake is situated the water was only three or four inches deep and rested on a layer of beautifully crystallized white salt the lake was quite circular and fringed with a border of brightly green succulent plants the precipitous walls of the crater were also clothed with wood so that the scene was both picturesque and curious a few years since the sailors belonging to a sealingvessel murdered their captain in this quiet spot and we saw his skull lying among the bushes during the greater part of our week on shore the sky was cloudless and if the tradewind failed for an hour the heat became very oppressive on two days the thermometer within the tent stood for some hours at but in the open air in the wind and sun at only the sand was extremely hot the thermometer placed in some of a brown colour immediately rose to and how much higher it would have risen i do not know for it was not graduated above that number the black sand felt much hotter so that even in thick boots it was disagreeable on this account to walk over it i will now offer a few general observations on the natural history of these islands i endeavoured to make as nearly a perfect collection in every branch as time permitted the plants have not yet been examined but professor henslow who has kindly undertaken the description of them informs me that there are probably many new species and perhaps even some new genera they all have an extremely weedy character and it would scarcely have been supposed that they had grown at an inconsiderable elevation directly under the equator in the lower and sterile parts the bush which from its minute brown leaves chiefly gives the leafless appearance to the brushwood is one of the euphorbiaceæ in the same region an acacia and a cactus opuntia galapageia with large oval compressed articulations springing from a cylindrical stem are in some parts common these are the only trees which in that part afford any shade near the summits of the different islands the vegetation has a very different character ferns and coarse grasses are abundant and the commonest tree is one of the compositæ treeferns are not present one of the most singular characters of the flora considering the position of this archipelago is the absence of every member of the palm family cocos island on the other hand which is the nearest point of land takes its name from the great number of cocoanut trees on it from the presence of the opuntias and some other plants the vegetation partakes more of the character of that of america than of any other country of mammalia a large kind of mouse forms a wellmarked species from its large thin ears and other characters it approaches in form a section of the genus which is confined to the sterile regions of south america there is also a rat which mr waterhouse believes is probably distinct from the english kind but i cannot help suspecting that it is only the same altered by the peculiar conditions of its new country in my collections from these islands mr gould considers that there are twentysix different species of land birds with the exception of one all probably are undescribed kinds which inhabit this archipelago and no other part of the world among the waders and waterfowl it is more difficult without detailed comparison to say what are new but a watersail which lives near the summits of the mountains is undescribed as perhaps is a totanus and a heron the only kind of gull which is found among these islands is also new when the wandering habits of this genus are considered this is a very remarkable circumstance the species most closely allied to it comes from the strait of magellan of the other aquatic birds the species appear the same with wellknown american birds the general character of the plumage of these birds is extremely plain and like the flora possesses little beauty although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago yet nearly all in their general structure habits colour of feathers and even tone of voice are strictly american the following brief list will give an idea of their kinds st a buzzard having many of the characters of polyborus or caracara and in its habits not to be distinguished from that peculiar south american genus d two owls d three species of tyrantflycatchers a form strictly american one of these appears identical with a common kind muscicapa coronata lath which has a very wide range from la plata throughout brazil to mexico th a sylvicola an american form and especially common in the northern division of the continent th three species of mockingbirds a genus common to both americas th a finch with a stiff tail and a long claw to its hinder toe closely allied to a north american genus th a swallow belonging to the american division of that genus th a dove like but distinct from the chilian species th a group of finches of which mr gould considers there are thirteen species and these he has distributed into four new subgenera these birds are the most singular of any in the archipelago they all agree in many points namely in a peculiar structure of their bill short tails general form and in their plumage the females are gray or brown but the old cocks jetblack all the species excepting two feed in flocks on the ground and have very similar habits it is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest grosbeak to another differing but little from that of a warbler of the aquatic birds i have already remarked that some are peculiar to these islands and some common to north and south america we will now turn to the order of reptiles which forms perhaps the most striking feature in the zoology of these islands the species are not numerous but the number of individuals of each kind is extraordinarily great there is one kind both of the turtle and tortoise of lizards four and of snakes about the same number i will first describe the habits of the tortoise testudo indicus which has been so frequently alluded to these animals are found i believe in all the islands of the archipelago certainly in the greater number they frequent in preference the high damp parts but likewise inhabit the lower and arid districts i have already mentioned proofs from the numbers which have been taken in a single day how very numerous they must be some individuals grow to an immense size mr lawson an englishman who had at the time of our visit charge of the colony told us that he had seen several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground and that some had afforded as much as two hundred pounds of meat the old males are the largest the females rarely growing to so great a size the male can readily be distinguished from the female by the greater length of its tail the tortoises which live on those islands where there is no water or in the lower and arid parts of the others chiefly feed on the succulent cactus those which frequent the higher and damp regions eat the leaves of various trees a kind of berry called guayavita which is acid and austere and likewise a pale green filamentous lichen that hangs in tresses from the boughs of the trees the tortoise is very fond of water drinking large quantities and wallowing in the mud the larger islands alone possess springs and these are always situated towards the central parts and at a considerable elevation the tortoises therefore which frequent the lower districts when thirsty are obliged to travel from a long distance hence broad and wellbeaten paths radiate off in every direction from the wells even down to the seacoast and the spaniards by following them up first discovered the wateringplaces when i landed at chatham island i could not imagine what animal travelled so methodically along the wellchosen tracks near the springs it was a curious spectacle to behold many of these great monsters one set eagerly travelling onwards with outstretched necks and another set returning after having drunk their fill when the tortoise arrives at the spring quite regardless of any spectator it buries its head in the water above its eyes and greedily swallows great mouthfuls at the rate of about ten in a minute the inhabitants say each animal stays three or four days in the neighbourhood of the water and then returns to the lower country but they differed in their accounts respecting the frequency of these visits the animal probably regulates them according to the nature of the food which it has consumed it is however certain that tortoises can subsist even on those islands where there is no other water than what falls during a few rainy days in the year i believe it is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as a reservoir for the moisture necessary to its existence such seems to be the case with the tortoise for some time after a visit to the springs the urinary bladder of these animals is distended with fluid which is said gradually to decrease in volume and to become less pure the inhabitants when walking in the lower district and overcome with thirst often take advantage of this circumstance by killing a tortoise and if the bladder is full drinking its contents in one i saw killed the fluid was quite limpid and had only a very slightly bitter taste the inhabitants however always drink first the water in the pericardium which is described as being best the tortoises when moving towards any definite point travel by night and day and arrive at their journeys end much sooner than would be expected the inhabitants from observations on marked individuals consider that they can move a distance of about eight miles in two or three days one large tortoise which i watched i found walked at the rate of sixty yards in ten minutes that is in the hour or four miles a dayallowing also a little time for it to eat on the road during the breeding season when the male and female are together the male utters a hoarse roar or bellowing which it is said can be heard at the distance of more than a hundred yards the female never uses her voice and the male only at such times so that when the people hear this noise they know the two are together they were at this time october laying their eggs the female where the soil is sandy deposits them together and covers them up with sand but where the ground is rocky she drops them indiscriminately in any hollow mr bynoe found seven placed in a line in a fissure the egg is white and spherical one which i measured was seven inches and threeeighths in circumference the young animals as soon as they are hatched fall a prey in great numbers to the buzzard with the habits of the caracara the old ones seem generally to die from accidents as from falling down precipices at least several of the inhabitants told me they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause the inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf certainly they do not overhear a person walking close behind them i was always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along to see how suddenly the instant i passed it would draw in its head and legs and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound as if struck dead i frequently got on their backs and then upon giving a few raps on the hinder part of the shell they would rise up and walk awaybut i found it very difficult to keep my balance the flesh of this animal is largely employed both fresh and salted and a beautifully clear oil is prepared from the fat when a tortoise is caught the man makes a slit in the skin near its tail so as to see inside its body whether the fat under the dorsal plate is thick if it is not the animal is liberated and it is said to recover soon from this strange operation in order to secure the tortoises it is not sufficient to turn them like turtle for they are often able to regain their upright position it was confidently asserted that the tortoises coming from different islands in the archipelago were slightly different in form and that in certain islands they attained a larger average size than in others mr lawson maintained that he could at once tell from which island any one was brought unfortunately the specimens which came home in the beagle were too small to institute any certain comparison this tortoise which goes by the name of testudo indicus is at present found in many parts of the world it is the opinion of mr bell and some others who have studied reptiles that it is not improbable that they all originally came from this archipelago when it is known how long these islands have been frequented by the bucaniers and that they constantly took away numbers of these animals alive it seems very probable that they should have distributed them in different parts of the world if this tortoise does not originally come from these islands it is a remarkable anomaly inasmuch as nearly all the other land inhabitants seem to have had their birthplace here of lizards there are four or five species two probably belong to the south american genus leiocephalus and two to amblyrhyncus this remarkable genus was characterized by mr bell from a stuffed specimen sent from mexico but which i conceive there can be little doubt originally came through some whaling ship from these islands the two species agree pretty closely in general appearance but one is aquatic and the other terrestrial in its habits mr bell thus concludes his description of amb cristatus on a comparison of this animal with the true iguanas the most striking and important discrepancy is in the form of the head instead of the long pointed narrow muzzle of those species we have here a short obtusely truncated head not so long as it is broad the mouth consequently only capable of being opened to a very short space these circumstances with the shortness and equality of the toes and the strength and curvature of the claws evidently indicate some striking peculiarity in its food and general habits on which however in the absence of all certain information i shall abstain from offering any conjecture the following account of these two lizards will i think show with what judgment mr bell foresaw a variation in habit accompanying change in structure first for the aquatic kind amb cristatus this lizard is extremely common on all the islands throughout the archipelago it lives exclusively on the rocky seabeaches and is never found at least i never saw one even ten yards inshore it is a hideouslooking creature of a dirty black colour stupid and sluggish in its movements the usual length of a fullgrown one is about a yard but there are some even four feet long i have seen a large one which weighed twenty pounds on the island of albemarle they seem to grow to a greater size than on any other these lizards were occasionally seen some hundred yards from the shore swimming about and captain collnett in his voyage says they go out to sea in shoals to fish with respect to the object i believe he is mistaken but the fact stated on such good authority cannot be doubted when in the water the animal swims with perfect ease and quickness by a serpentine movement of its body and flattened tailthe legs during this time being motionless and closely collapsed on its sides a seaman on board sank one with a heavy weight attached to it thinking thus to kill it directly but when an hour afterwards he drew up the line the lizard was quite active their limbs and strong claws are admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured masses of lava which every where form the coast in such situations a group of six or seven of these hideous reptiles may oftentimes be seen on the black rocks a few feet above the surf basking in the sun with outstretched legs i opened the stomach of several and in each case found it largely distended with minced seaweed of that kind which grows in thin foliaceous expansions of a bright green or dull red colour i do not recollect having observed this seaweed in any quantity on the tidal rocks and i have reason to believe it grows at the bottom of the sea at some little distance from the coast if such is the case the object of these animals occasionally going out to sea is explained the stomach contained nothing but the seaweed mr bynoe however found a piece of a crab in one but this might have got in accidentally in the same manner as i have seen a caterpillar in the midst of some lichen in the paunch of a tortoise the intestines were large as in other herbivorous animals the nature of this lizards food as well as the structure of its tail and the certain fact of its having been seen voluntarily swimming out at sea absolutely prove its aquatic habits yet there is in this respect one strange anomaly namely that when frightened it will not enter the water from this cause it is easy to drive these lizards down to any little point overhanging the sea where they will sooner allow a person to catch hold of their tail than jump into the water they do not seem to have any notion of biting but when much frightened they squirt a drop of fluid from each nostril one day i carried one to a deep pool left by the retiring tide and threw it in several times as far as i was able it invariably returned in a direct line to the spot where i stood it swam near the bottom with a very graceful and rapid movement and occasionally aided itself over the uneven ground with its feet as soon as it arrived near the margin but still being under water it either tried to conceal itself in the tufts of seaweed or it entered some crevice as soon as it thought the danger was past it crawled out on the dry rocks and shuffled away as quickly as it could i several times caught this same lizard by driving it down to a point and though possessed of such perfect powers of diving and swimming nothing would induce it to enter the water and as often as i threw it in it returned in the manner above described perhaps this singular piece of apparent stupidity may be accounted for by the circumstance that this reptile has no enemy whatever on shore whereas at sea it must often fall a prey to the numerous sharks hence probably urged by a fixed and hereditary instinct that the shore is its place of safety whatever the emergency may be it there takes refuge during our visit in october i saw extremely few small individuals of this species and none i should think under a year old from this circumstance it seems probable that the breeding season had not commenced i asked several of the inhabitants if they knew where it laid its eggs they said that although well acquainted with the eggs of the other kind they had not the least knowledge of the manner in which this species is propagateda fact considering how common an animal this lizard is not a little extraordinary we will now turn to the terrestrial species amb subcristatus of gray this species differently from the last is confined to the central islands of the archipelago namely to albemarle james barrington and indefatigable to the southward in charles hood and chatham islands and to the northward in towers bindloes and abington i neither saw nor heard of any it would appear as if this species had been created in the centre of the archipelago and thence had been dispersed only to a certain distance in the central islands they inhabit both the higher and damp as well as the lower and sterile parts but in the latter they are much the most numerous i cannot give a more forcible proof of their numbers than by stating that when we were left at james island we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our tent these lizards like their brothers the seakind are ugly animals and from their low facial angle have a singularly stupid appearance in size perhaps they are a little inferior to the latter but several of them weighed between ten and fifteen pounds each the colour of their belly front legs and head excepting the crown which is nearly white is a dirty yellowishorange the back is a brownishred which in the younger specimens is darker in their movements they are lazy and half torpid when not frightened they slowly crawl along with their tails and bellies dragging on the ground they often stop and doze for a minute with closed eyes and hind legs spread out on the parched soil they inhabit burrows which they sometimes excavate between fragments of lava but more generally on level patches of the soft volcanic sandstone the holes do not appear to be very deep and they enter the ground at a small angle so that when walking over these lizard warrens the soil is constantly giving way much to the annoyance of the tired walker this animal when excavating its burrow alternately works the opposite sides of its body one front leg for a short time scratches up the soil and throws it towards the hind foot which is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole this side of the body being tired the other takes up the task and so on alternately i watched one for a long time till half its body was buried i then walked up and pulled it by the tail at this it was greatly astonished and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter and then stared me in the face as much as to say what made you pull my tail they feed by day and do not wander far from their burrows and if frightened they rush to them with a most awkward gait except when running down hill they cannot move very fast which appears chiefly owing to the lateral position of their legs they are not at all timorous when attentively watching any one they curl their tails and raising themselves on their front legs nod their heads vertically with a quick movement and try to look very fierce but in reality they are not at all so if one just stamps the ground down go their tails and off they shuffle as quickly as they can i have frequently observed small muscivorous lizards when watching any thing nod their heads in precisely the same manner but i do not at all know for what purpose if this amblyrhyncus is held and plagued with a stick it will bite it very severely but i caught many by the tail and they never tried to bite me if two are placed on the ground and held together they will fight and bite each other till blood is drawn the individuals and they are the greater number which inhabit the lower country can scarcely taste a drop of water throughout the year but they consume much of the succulent cactus the branches of which are occasionally broken off by the wind i have sometimes thrown a piece to two or three when together and it was amusing enough to see each trying to sieze and carry it away in its mouth like so many hungry dogs with a bone they eat very deliberately but do not chew their food the little birds are aware how harmless these creatures are i have seen one of the thickbilled finches picking at one end of a piece of cactus which is in request among all the animals of the lower region whilst a lizard was eating at the other and afterwards the little bird with the utmost indifference hopped on the back of the reptile i opened the stomachs of several and found them full of vegetable fibres and leaves of different trees especially of a species of acacia in the upper region they live chiefly on the acid and astringent berries of the guayavita under which trees i have seen these lizards and the huge tortoises feeding together to obtain the acacialeaves they crawl up the low stunted trees and it is not uncommon to see one or a pair quietly browsing whilst seated on a branch several feet above the ground the meat of these animals when cooked is white and by those whose stomachs rise above all prejudices it is relished as very good food humboldt has remarked that in intertropical south america all lizards which inhabit dry regions are esteemed delicacies for the table the inhabitants say that those inhabiting the damp region drink water but that the others do not travel up for it from the sterile country like the tortoises at the time of our visit the females had within their bodies numerous large elongated eggs these they lay in their burrows and the inhabitants seek them for food these two species of amblyrhyncus agree as i have already stated in general structure and in many of their habits neither have that rapid movement so characteristic of true lacerta and iguana they are both herbivorous although the kind of vegetation consumed in each case is so very different mr bell has giv en the name to the genus from the shortness of the snout indeed the form of the mouth may almost be compared to that of the tortoise one is tempted to suppose this is an adaptation to their herbivorous appetites it is very interesting thus to find a wellcharacterized genus having its aquatic and terrestrial species belonging to so confined a portion of the world the former species is by far the most remarkable because it is the only existing saurian which can properly be said to be a maritime animal i should perhaps have mentioned earlier that in the whole archipelago there is only one rill of fresh water that reaches the coast yet these reptiles frequent the seabeaches and no other parts in all the islands moreover there is no existing lizard as far as i am aware excepting this amblyrhyncus that feeds exclusively on aquatic productions if however we refer to epochs long past we shall find such habits common to several gigantic animals of the saurian race to conclude with the order of reptiles of snakes there are several species but all harmless of toads and frogs there are none i was surprised at this considering how well the temperate and damp woods in the elevated parts appeared adapted for their habits it recalled to my mind the singular statement made by bory st vincent namely that none of this family are to be found on the volcanic islands in the great oceans there certainly appears to be some foundation for this observation which is the more remarkable when compared with the case of lizards which are generally among the earliest colonists of the smallest islet it may be asked whether this is not owing to the different facilities of transport through saltwater of the eggs of the latter protected by a calcareous coat and of the slimy spawn of the former as i at first observed these islands are not so remarkable for the number of species of reptiles as for that of individuals when we remember the wellbeaten paths made by the many hundred great tortoisesthe warrens of the terrestrial amblyrhyncusand the groups of the aquatic species basking on the coastrockswe must admit that there is no other quarter of the world where this order replaces the herbivorous mammalia in so extraordinary a manner it is worthy of observation by the geologist who will probably refer back in his mind to the secondary periods when the saurians were developed with dimensions which at the present day can be compared only to the cetaceous mammalia that this archipelago instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation cannot be considered otherwise than extremely arid and for an equatorial region remarkably temperate to finish with the zoology i took great pains in collecting the insects but i was surprised to find even in the high and damp region how exceedingly few they were in number the forests of tierra del fuego are certainly much more barren but with that exception i never collected in so poor a country in the lower and sterile land i took seven species of heteromera and a few other insects but in the fine thriving woods towards the centre of the islands although i perseveringly swept under the bushes during all kinds of weather i obtained only a few minute diptera and hymenoptera owing to this scarcity of insects nearly all the birds live in the lower country and the part which any one would have thought much the most favourable for them is frequented only by a few of the small tyrantflycatchers i do not believe a single bird excepting the waterrail is confined to the damp region mr waterhouse informs me that nearly all the insects belong to european forms and that they do not by any means possess an equatorial character i did not take a single one of large size or of bright colours this last observation applies equally to the birds and flowers it is worthy of remark that
