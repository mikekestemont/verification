alluvium which front similar ones on the opposite side of the channelwhile the other is exclusively bordered by the older rocks in the former called navarin island both foxes and guanacoes occur but in the latter hoste island although similar in every respect and only separated by a channel a little more than half a mile wide i have the word of jemmy button for saying that neither of these animals are found i must confess to an exception to the rule in the presence of a small mouse of a species occurring likewise in patagonia the gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds occasionally the plaintive note of a white tufted tyrantflycatcher may be heard concealed near the summit of the most lofty trees and more rarely the loud strange cry of a black woodpecker with a fine scarlet crest on its head a little duskycoloured wren scytalopus fuscus hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the fallen and decaying trunks but the creeper synallaxis tupinieri is the commonest bird in the country throughout the beech forests high up and low down in the most gloomy wet and impenetrable ravines it may be met with this little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it really is from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any person who enters these silent woods continually uttering a harsh twitter it flutters from tree to tree within a few feet of the intruders face it is far from wishing for the modest concealment of the true creeper certhia familiaris nor does it like that bird run up and down the trunks of trees but industriously after the manner of a willow wren hops about and searches for insects on every twig and branch in the more open parts three or four species of finches a thrush a starling or icterus two furnarii and several hawks and owls occur the absence of any species whatever in the whole class of reptiles is a marked feature in the zoology of this country as well as in that of the falkland islands i do not ground this statement merely on my own observation but i heard it from the spanish inhabitants of the latter place and from jemmy button with regard to tierra del fuego on the banks of the st cruz in south i saw a frog and it is not improbable that these animals as well as lizards may be found as far south as the strait of magellan where the country retains the character of patagonia but within the damp and cold limit not one occurs that the climate would not have suited some of the orders such as lizards might have been foreseen but with respect to frogs this was not so obvious coleopterous insects occur in very small numbers until i had endeavoured by every means to find them i could not believe that a country as large as scotland covered with vegetable productions and with a variety of stations would ever have been so unproductive the greater part of my small collection consists of alpine insects harpalidæ and heteromera found beneath stones above the limit of the forest lower down with the exception of some few curculiones scarcely any could be found the chrysomelidæ which are so preeminently characteristic of the tropics are here almost entirely absent this must depend on the climate for the quantity of vegetable matter is superfluously great in the hottest part of the summer the mean of the maxima for thirtyseven successive days was and the thermometer on some of the days rose to yet there were no orthoptera very few diptera lepidoptera or hymenoptera in the pools of water i found but few aquatic beetles and not any freshwater shells succinea at first appears an exception but here it must be called a terrestrial species for it lives on the damp herbage far from water land shells could only be procured in the same situations with the alpine beetles i have already contrasted the climate as well as the general appearance of tierra del fuego with that of patagonia and the difference is strongly exemplified in the entomology i believe i must except one alpine haltica and a single specimen of a melasoma mr waterhouse who was good enough to look at my collection from this place tells me that of the harpalidæ there are eight or nine speciesthe forms of the greater number being very peculiar of heteromera four or five species of rhyncophora six or seven and of the following families one species in each staphylinidæ elateridæ cebrionidæ melolonthidæ the species in the other orders were even fewer in all the orders the scarcity of the individuals was even more remarkable than that of the species i do not believe they have a species in common certainly the general character of the insects is widely different if we turn from the land to the sea we shall find the latter as abundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly so in all parts of the world a rocky and partially protected shore perhaps supports in a given space a greater number of individual animals than any other kind of station here under every stone numerous crawling creatures swarmed and especially crustacea of the family of cymothoades the number of sphæroma was truly wonderful as these animals when coiled up have some resemblance to trilobites they were an interesting sight to a geologist on the tidal rocks patelliform shells of large size were very abundant even at the depth of forty or fifty fathoms the bottom of the sea was far from sterile as was shown by the abundance of small strong corallines there is one marine production which from its importance is worthy of a particular history it is the kelp or fucus giganteus of solander this plant grows on every rock from lowwater mark to a great depth both on the outer coast and within the channels i believe during the voyages of the adventure and beagle not one rock near the surface was discovered which was not buoyed by this floating weed the good service it thus affords to vessels navigating near this stormy land is evident and it certainly has saved many a one from being wrecked i know few things more surprising than to see this plant growing and flourishing amidst those great breakers of the western ocean which no mass of rock let it be ever so hard can long resist the stem is round slimy and smooth and seldom has a diameter of so much as an inch a few taken together are sufficiently strong to support the weight of the large loose stones to which in the inland channels they grow attached and some of these stones are so heavy that when drawn to the surface they can scarcely be lifted into a boat by one person captain cook in his second voyage says that at kerguelen land some of this weed is of a most enormous length though the stem is not much thicker than a mans thumb i have mentioned that on some of the shoals upon which it grows we did not strike ground with a line of twentyfour fathoms the depth of water therefore must have been greater and as this weed does not grow in a perpendicular direction but makes a very acute angle with the bottom and much of it afterwards spreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea i am well warranted to say that some of it grows to the length of sixty fathoms and upwards certainly at the falkland islands and about tierra del fuego extensive beds frequently spring up from ten and fifteen fathom water i do not suppose the stem of any other plant attains so great a length as feet as stated by captain cook its geographical range is very considerable it is found from the extreme southern islets near cape horn as far north on the eastern coast according to information given me by mr stokes as lat and on the western it was tolerably abundant but far from luxuriant at chiloe in lat it may possibly extend a little further northward but is soon succeeded by a different species we thus have a range of fifteen degrees in latitude and as cook who must have been well acquainted with the species found it at kerguelen land no less than in longitude the number of living creatures of all orders whose existence intimately depends on the kelp is wonderful a great volume might be written describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of seaweed almost every leaf excepting those that float on the surface is so thickly incrusted with corallines as to be of a white colour we find exquisitelydelicate structures some inhabited by simple hydralike polypi others by more organized kinds and beautiful compound ascidiæ on the flat surfaces of the leaves various patelliform shells trochi uncovered molluscs and some bivalves are attached innumerable crustacea frequent every part of the plant on shaking the great entangled roots a pile of small fish shells cuttlefish crabs of all orders seaeggs starfish beautiful holuthuriæ some taking the external form of the nudibranch molluscs planariæ and crawling nereidous animals of a multitude of forms all fall out together often as i recurred to a branch of the kelp i never failed to discover animals of new and curious structures in chiloe where as i have said the kelp did not thrive very well the numerous shells corallines and crustacea were absent but there yet remained a few of the flustraceæ and some compound ascidiæ the latter however were of different species from those in tierra del fuego we here see the fucus possessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an abode i can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions yet if the latter should be destroyed in any country i do not believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as under similar circumstances would happen with the kelp amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live which nowhere else would find food or shelter with their destruction the many cormorants divers and other fishing birds the otters seals and porpoises would soon perish also and lastly the fuegian savage the miserable lord of this miserable land would redouble his cannibal feast decrease in numbers and perhaps cease to exist june thwe weighed anchor early in the morning and left port famine captain fitzroy determined to leave the strait of magellan by the magdalen channel which had not long been discovered our course lay due south down that gloomy passage which i have before alluded to as appearing to lead to another and worse world the wind was fair but the atmosphere was very thick so that we missed much curious scenery the dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains from their summits nearly to their bases the glimpses which we caught through the dusky mass were highly interesting jagged points cones of snow blue glaciers strong outlines marked on a lurid sky were seen at different distances and heights in the midst of such scenery we anchored at cape turn close to mount sarmiento which was then hidden in the clouds at the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides of our little cove there was one deserted wigwam and it alone reminded us that man sometimes wandered in these desolate regions but it would be difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have less claims or less authority the inanimate works of naturerock ice snow wind and waterall warring with each other yet combined against manhere reigned in absolute sovereignty june thin the morning we were delighted by seeing the veil of mist gradually rise from sarmiento and display it to our view this mountain which is one of the highest in tierra del fuego has an elevation of feet its base for about an eighth of its total height is clothed by dusky woods and above this a field of snow extends to the summit these vast piles of snow which never melt and seem destined to last as long as the world holds together present a noble and even sublime spectacle the outline of the mountain was admirably clear and defined owing to the abundance of light reflected from the white and glittering surface no shadows are cast on any part and those lines which intersect the sky can alone be distinguished hence the mass stood out in the boldest relief several glaciers descended in a winding course from the snow to the seacoast they may be likened to great frozen niagaras and perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are to the full as beautiful as the moving ones of water by night we reached the western part of the channel but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be found we were in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this narrow arm of the sea during a pitchdark night of fourteen hours long june thin the morning we made the best of our way into the open pacific the western coast generally consists of low rounded quite barren hills of granite and greenstone sir john narborough called one part south desolation because it is so desolate a land to behold and well indeed might he say so outside the main islands there are numberless scattered rocks on which the long swell of the open ocean incessantly rages we passed out between the east and west furies and a little further northward there are so many breakers that the sea is called the milky way one sight of such a coast is enough to make a landsman dream for a week about shipwreck peril and death and with this sight we bade farewell for ever to tierra del fuego chapter xiv valparaiso excursion to base of andes structure of land ascend bell of quillota shattered masses of greenstone immense valleys mines state of miners santiago hot baths of cauquenes gold mines grinding mills perforated stones habits of puma el turco and tapacolo hummingbirds central chile july dthe beagle anchored late at night in the bay of valparaiso the chief seaport of chile when morning came every thing appeared delightful after tierra del fuego the climate felt quite deliciousthe atmosphere so dry and the heavens so clear and blue with the sun shining brightly that all nature seemed sparkling with life the view from the anchorage is very pretty the town is built at the very foot of a range of hills about feet high and rather steep from its position it consists of one long straggling street which runs parallel to the beach and wherever a ravine comes down the houses are piled up on each side of it the rounded hills being only partially protected by a very scanty vegetation are worn into numberless little gullies which expose a singularly bright red soil from this cause and from the low whitewashed houses with tile roofs the view reminded me of st cruz in teneriffe in a northeasterly direction there are some fine glimpses of the andes but these mountains appear much grander when viewed from the neighbouring hills the great distance at which they are situated can then more readily be perceived the volcano of aconcagua is particularly magnificent this huge and irregularly conical mass has an elevation greater than that of chimborazo for from measurements made by the officers in the beagle its height is no less than feet the cordillera however viewed from this point owe the greater part of their beauty to the atmosphere through which they are seen when the sun was setting in the pacific it was admirable to watch how clearly their rugged outlines could be distinguished yet how varied and how delicate were the shades of their colour i had the good fortune to find living here mr richard corfield an old schoolfellow and friend to whose hospitality and kindness i was greatly indebted in having afforded me a most pleasant residence during the beagles stay in chile the immediate neighbourhood of valparaiso is not very productive to the naturalist the surrounding hills consist of a granitic formation which sometimes assumes the character of gneiss and sometimes of granite their summits are flattopped and their flanks rounded i have before stated that forests cover that side of the cordillera which fronts the prevailing winds here during the summer which forms the longer portion of the year the winds blow steadily from the southward and a little off shore so that rain never falls during the three winter months it is however sufficiently abundant the vegetation in consequence is very scanty except in some deep valleys trees nowhere occur and only a little grass and a few low bushes are scattered over the less steep parts of the hills when we reflect that at the distance of miles to the southward this side of the andes is completely hidden by one impenetrable forest the contrast is very remarkable i took several long walks while collecting objects of natural history the country is pleasant for exercise there are many very beautiful flowers and as in most other dry climates the plants and shrubs possess strong and peculiar odours even ones clothes by brushing through them became scented i did not yet cease from wonder at finding each succeeding day as fine as the foregoing what a difference does climate make in the enjoyment of life how opposite are the sensations when viewing black mountains halfenveloped in clouds and seeing another range through the light blue haze of a fine day the one for a time may be very sublime the other is all gaiety and happy life august thi set out on a riding excursion for the purpose of geologizing the basal parts of the andes which alone at this time of the year were not shut up by the winter snow our first days ride was northward along the seacoast after dark we reached the hacienda of quintero the estate which formerly belonged to lord cochrane my object in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which are elevated some yards above the level of the sea they nearly all consist of one species of erycina and these shells at the present day live together in great numbers on the sandy flats so wonderfully numerous are those forming the beds that for years they have been quarried and burnt for the lime with which the large town of valparaiso is supplied as any change of level even in this neighbourhood has often been disputed i may add that i saw dead barnacles adhering to points of solid rock which were now so much elevated that even during gales of wind they would scarcely be wetted by the spray thwe returned towards the valley of quillota the country was exceedingly pleasant just such as poets would call pastoral green open lawns separated by small valleys with rivulets and the cottages we will suppose of the shepherds scattered on the hillsides we were obliged to cross the ridge of the chilecauquen at its base there were many fine evergreen foresttrees but these only flourished in the ravines where there was running water any person who had seen only the country near valparaiso would never have imagined that there had been such picturesque spots in chile as soon as we reached the brow of the sierra the valley of quillota was immediately under our feet the prospect was one of remarkable artificial luxuriance the valley is very broad and quite flat and is thus easily irrigated in all parts the little square gardens are crowded with orange and olive trees and every sort of vegetable on each side huge bare mountains rise and this from the contrast renders the patchwork valley the more pleasing whoever called valparaiso the valley of paradise must have been thinking of quillota we crossed over to the hacienda de san isidoro situated at the very foot of the bell mountain chile as may be seen in the maps is a narrow strip of land between the cordillera and the pacific and this strip is itself traversed by several mountainlines which in this part run parallel to the great range between these outer lines and the main cordillera a succession of level basins generally opening into each other by narrow passages extend far to the southward in these the principal towns are situated as san felipe santiago s fernando these basins or plains together with the transverse flat valleys like that of quillota which connect them with the coast i have little doubt are the bottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays such as at the present day intersect every part of tierra del fuego and the west coast of patagonia chile must formerly have resembled the latter country in the configuration of its land and water this resemblance was occasionally seen with great force when a level fogbank covered as with a mantle all the lower parts of the country the white vapour curling into the ravines beautifully represented little coves and bays and here and there a solitary hillock peeping up showed that it had formerly stood there as an islet the contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the irregular mountains gave the scenery a character which to me was novel and very interesting from the natural slope to seaward of these plains they are very easily irrigated and in consequence singularly fertile without this process the land would produce scarcely any thing for during the whole summer the sky is cloudless the mountains and hills are dotted over with bushes and low trees and excepting these the vegetation is very scanty each landowner in the valley possesses a certain portion of hillcountry where his halfwild cattle in considerable numbers manage to find sufficient pasture once every year there is a grand rodeo when all the cattle are driven down counted and marked and a certain number separated to be fattened in the irrigated fields wheat is extensively cultivated and also a good deal of indian corn a kind of bean is however the staple article of food for the common labourers the orchards produce an overflowing abundance of peaches figs and grapes with all these advantages the inhabitants of the country ought to be much more prosperous than they are august ththe mayordomo of the hacienda was good enough to give me a guide and fresh horses and in the morning we set out to ascend the campana or bell mountain which is feet high the paths were very bad but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble we reached by the evening a spring called the agua del guanaco which is situated at a great height this must be an old name for it is very many years since a guanaco has drunk its waters during the ascent i noticed that nothing grew on the northern slope but bushes whilst on the southern there was a sort of bamboo about fifteen feet high in a few places there were palms and i was surprised to see one at an elevation of at least feet these palms are for their family ugly trees their stem is very large and of a curious form being thicker in the middle than at the base or top they are excessively numerous in some parts of chile and valuable on account of a sort of treacle made from the sap on one estate near petorca they tried to count them but failed after having numbered several hundred thousand every year in august early spring time very many are cut down and when the trunk is lying on the ground the crown of leaves is lopped off the sap then immediately begins to flow from the upper end and continues so doing for some months it is however necessary that a thin slice should be shaved off from that end every morning so as to expose a fresh surface a good tree will give ninety gallons and all this must have been contained in the vessels of the apparently dry trunk it is said that the sap flows much more quickly on those days when the sun is powerful and likewise that it is absolutely necessary to take care in cutting down the tree that it should fall with its head upwards on the side of the hill for if it falls down the slope scarcely any sap will flow although in that case one would have thought that the action would have been aided instead of checked by the force of gravity the sap is concentrated by boiling and is then called treacle which it very much resembles in taste we unsaddled our horses near the spring and prepared to pass the night the evening was fine and the atmosphere so clear that the masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of valparaiso although no less than twentysix geographical miles distant could be distinguished clearly as little black streaks a ship doubling the point under sail appeared as a bright white speck anson expresses much surprise in his voyage at the distance his vessels were discovered from the coast but he did not sufficiently allow for the height of the land and the great transparency of the air the setting of the sun was glorious the valleys being black whilst the snowy peaks of the andes yet retained a ruby tint when it was dark we made a fire beneath a little arbour of bamboos fried our charqui or dried strips of beef took our maté and were quite comfortable there is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open air the evening was calm and stillthe shrill noise of the mountain bizcacha and the faint cry of the goatsucker were only occasionally to be heard besides these few birds or even insects frequent these dry parched mountains august thin the morning we climbed up the rough mass of greenstone which crowns the summit this rock as frequently happens was much shattered and broken into huge angular fragments i observed however one remarkable circumstance namely that many of the surfaces presented every degree of freshnesssome appearing as if broken the day before whilst on others lichens had either just become or had long grown attached i so fully believed that this was owing to the frequent earthquakes that i felt inclined to hurry from beneath every pile of the loose masses as this is an observation in which one would be very apt to be deceived i doubted its accuracy until ascending mount wellington near hobart town the summit of that mountain is similarly composed and similarly shattered but all the blocks appeared as if they had been hurled into their present position thousands of years ago we spent the day on the summit and i never enjoyed one more thoroughly chile bounded by the andes and the pacific was seen as in a map the pleasure from the scenery in itself beautiful was heightened by the many reflections which arose from the mere view of the grand range with its lesser parallel ones and of the broad valley of quillota directly intersecting the latter who can avoid admiring the wonderful force which has upheaved these mountains and even more so the countless ages which it must have required to have broken through removed and levelled whole masses of them it is well in this case to call to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of patagonia which if heaped on the cordillera would increase by so many thousand feet its height when in that country i wondered how any mountainchain could have supplied such masses and not have been utterly obliterated we must not now reverse the wonder and doubt whether allpowerful time can grind down mountainseven the gigantic cordillerainto gravel and mud the appearance of the andes was different from that which i had expected the lower line of the snow was of course horizontal and to this line the even summits of the range seemed quite parallel only at long intervals a mass of points or a single cone showed where a volcano had existed or does now exist hence the range resembled a great solid wall surmounted here and there by a tower and thus made a most complete barrier to the country almost every part of the hill has been drilled by attempts to open goldmines i was surprised to see on the actual summit which could only be reached by climbing a small pit where some yellowish crystals of hypersthene had induced somebody to throw away his labour the rage for mining has left scarcely a spot in chile unexamined i spent the evening as before talking round the fire with my two companions the guasos of chile which correspond to the gauchos of the pampas are however a very different set of beings chile is the more civilized of the two countries and the inhabitants in consequence have lost much individual character gradations in rank are much more strongly marked the guaso does not by any means consider every man his equal and i was quite surprised to find that my companions did not like to eat at the same time with myself this feeling of inequality is a necessary consequence of the existence of an aristocracy of wealth it is said that some few of the greater landowners possess from five to ten thousand pounds sterling per annum an inequality of riches which i believe is not met with in any of the cattlebreeding countries to the eastward of the andes a traveller does not here meet that unbounded hospitality which refuses all payment but yet is so kindly offered that no scruples can be raised in accepting it almost every house in chile will receive you for the night but a trifle is expected to be given in the morning even a rich man will accept two or three shillings the gaucho although he may be a cutthroat is a gentleman the guaso is in few respects better but at the same time a vulgar ordinary fellow the two men although employed much in the same manner are different in their habits and attire and the peculiarities of each are universal in their respective countries the gaucho seems part of his horse and scorns to exert himself excepting when on its back the guaso may be hired to work as a labourer in the fields the former lives entirely on animal food the latter almost wholly on vegetable we do not here see the white boots the broad drawers and scarlet chilipa the picturesque costume of the pampas here common trousers are protected by black and green worsted leggings the poncho however is common to both the chief pride in the guaso lies in his spurs which are absurdly large i measured one which was six inches in the diameter of the rowel and the rowel itself contained upwards of thirty points the stirrups are on the same scale each consisting of a square carved block of wood hollowed out yet weighing three or four pounds the guaso is perhaps more expert with the lazo than the gaucho but from the nature of the country he does not know the use of the bolas august thwe descended the mountain and passed some beautiful little spots with rivulets and fine trees having slept at the same hacienda as before we rode during the two succeeding days up the valley and passed through quillota which is more like a collection of nurserygardens than a town the orchards were beautiful presenting one mass of peachblossoms i saw also in one or two places the datepalm it is a most stately tree and i should think a group of them in their native asiatic and african deserts must be superb we passed likewise san felipe a pretty straggling town like quillota the valley in this part expands into one of those great bays or plains reaching to the foot of the cordillera which have been mentioned as forming so curious a part of the scenery of chile in the evening we reached the mines of jajuel situated in a ravine at the flank of the great chain i staid here five days my host the superintendent of the mine was a shrewd but rather ignorant cornish miner he had married a spanish woman and did not mean to return home but his admiration for the mines of cornwall remained unbounded amongst many other questions he asked me now that george rex is dead how many more of the family of rexes are yet alive this rex certainly must be a relation of the great author finis who wrote all books these mines are of copper and the ore is all shipped to swansea to be smelted hence the mines have an aspect singularly quiet as compared to those in england here no smoke furnaces or great steamengines disturb the solitude of the surrounding mountains the chilian government or rather the old spanish law encourages by every method the searching for mines the discoverer may work a mine on any ground by paying five shillings and before paying this he may try even in the garden of another man for twenty days it is now well known that the chilian method of mining is the cheapest my host says the two principal improvements introduced by foreigners have been first reducing by previous roasting the copper pyriteswhich being the common ore in cornwall the english miners were astounded on their arrival to find thrown away as useless secondly stamping and washing the scoriæ from the furnacesby which process particles of metal are recovered in abundance i have actually seen mules carrying to the coast for transportation to england a cargo of such cinders but the first case is much the most curious the chilian miners were so convinced that copper pyrites contained not a particle of copper that they laughed at the englishmen for their ignorance who laughed in turn and bought their richest veins for a few dollars it is very odd that in a country where mining had been extensively carried on for many years so simple a process as gently roasting the ore to expel the sulphur previous to smelting it had never been discovered a few improvements have likewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery but even to the present day water is removed from some mines by men carrying it up the shaft in leathern bags the labouring men work very hard they have little time allowed for their meals and during summer and winter they begin when it is light and leave off at dark they are paid one pound sterling a month and their food is given them this for breakfast consists of sixteen figs and two small loaves of bread for dinner boiled beans for supper broken roasted wheat grain they scarcely ever taste meat as with the twelve pounds per annum they have to clothe themselves and support their families the miners who work in the mine itself have twentyfive shillings per month and are allowed a little charqui but these men come down from their bleak habitations only once in every fortnight or three weeks during my stay here i thoroughly enjoyed scrambling about these huge mountains the geology as might have been expected was very interesting the shattered and baked rocks traversed by innumerable dykes of greenstone showed what commotions had formerly taken place there the scenery was much the same as that near the bell of quillotadry barren mountains dotted at intervals by bushes with a scanty foliage the cactuses or rather opuntias were here very numerous i measured one of as pherical figure which including the spines was six feet and four inches in circumference the height of the common cylindrical branching kind is from twelve to fifteen feet and the girth with spines of the branches between three and four a heavy fall of snow on the mountains prevented me during the last two days from making some interesting excursions i attempted to reach a lake which the inhabitants from some unaccountable reason believe to be an arm of the sea during a very dry season it was proposed to attempt cutting a channel from it for the sake of the water but the padre after a consultation declared it was too dangerous as all chile would be inundated if as generally supposed the lake was connected with the pacific we ascended to a great height but becoming involved in the snowdrifts failed in reaching this wonderful lake and had some difficulty in returning i thought we should have lost our horses for there was no means of guessing how deep the drifts were and the animals when led could only move by jumping the black sky showed that a fresh snowstorm was gathering and we therefore were not a little glad when we escaped by the time we reached the base the storm commenced and it was lucky for us that this did not happen three hours earlier in the day august thwe left jajuel and again crossed the basin of s felipe the day was truly chilian glaringly bright and the atmosphere quite clear the thick and uniform covering of newlyfallen snow rendered the view of the volcano of aconcagua and the main chain quite glorious we were now on the road to santiago the capital of chile we crossed the cerro del talguen and slept at a little rancho the host talking about the state of chile as compared to other countries was very humble some see with two eyes and some with one but for my part i do not think that chile sees with any august thafter crossing many low hills we descended into the small landlocked plain of guitron in the basins such as this one which are elevated from to feet above the sea two species of acacia which are stunted in their forms and stand wide apart from each other grow in large numbers these trees are never found near the seacoast and this gives another characteristic feature to the scenery of these basins we crossed a low ridge which separates guitron from the great plain on which santiago stands the view was here preeminently striking the dead level surface covered in parts by woods of acacia and with the city in the distance abutting horizontally against the base of the andes whose snowy peaks were bright with the evening sun at the first glance of this view it was quite evident that the plain represented the extent of a former inland sea as soon as we gained the level road we pushed our horses into a gallop and reached the city before it was dark i staid a week in santiago and enjoyed myself very much in the morning i rode to various places on the plain and in the evening dined with several of the english merchants whose hospitality at this place is well known a neverfailing source of pleasure was to ascend the little pap of rock fort st lucia which projects in the middle of the city the scenery certainly is most striking and as i have said very peculiar i am informed that this same character is common to the cities on the great mexican platform of the town i have nothing to say in detail it is not so fine or so large as buenos ayres but is built after the same model i arrived here by a circuit to the north so i resolved to return to valparaiso by a rather longer excursion to the southward of the direct road september thby the middle of the day we arrived at one of the suspension bridges made of hide which crosses the maypo a large turbulent river a few leagues south of santiago these bridges are very poor affairs the road following the curvature of the suspending ropes is made of bundles of sticks placed close together it was full of holes and oscillated rather fearfully even from the weight of a man leading his horse in the evening we reached a comfortable farmhouse where there were several very pretty signoritas they were much horrified at my having entered one of their churches out of mere curiosity they asked me why do you not become a christianfor our religion is certain i assured them i was a sort of christian but they would not hear of itappealing to my own words do not your padres your very bishops marry the absurdity of a bishop having a wife particularly struck them they scarcely knew whether to be most amused or horrorstruck at such an enormity thwe proceeded due south and slept at rancagua the road passed over the level but narrow plain bounded on one side by lofty hills and on the other by the cordillera the next day we turned up the valley of the rio cachapual in which the hotbaths of cauquenes long celebrated for their medicinal properties are situated the suspension bridges in the less frequented parts are generally taken down during the winter when the rivers are low such was the case in this valley and we were therefore obliged to cross the stream on horseback this is rather disagreeable for the foaming water though not deep rushes so quickly over the bed of large rounded stones that ones head becomes quite confused and it is difficult even to perceive whether the horse is moving onward or standing still in summer when the snow melts the torrents are quite impassable their strength and fury is then extremely great as might be plainly seen by the marks which they had left we reached the baths in the evening and staid there five days being confined the two last by heavy rain the buildings consist of a square of miserable little hovels each with a single table and bench they are situated in a narrow deep valley just without the central cordillera it is a quiet solitary spot with a good deal of wild beauty the mineral springs of cauquenes burst forth on a line of dislocation crossing a mass of stratified rock the whole of which betrays the action of heat a considerable quantity of gas is continually escaping from the same orifices with the water though the springs are only a few yards apart they have very different temperatures and this appears to be the result of an unequal mixture of cold water for those with the lowest temperature have scarcely any mineral taste after the great earthquake of the springs ceased and the water did not return for nearly a year it is said that they have not since regained their former volume or temperature these springs were also much affected by the earthquake of the temperature being suddenly changed from to it seems probable that mineral waters rising deep from the bowels of the earth would always be more deranged by subterranean disturbances than those nearer the surface the man who had charge of the baths assured me that in summer the water is hotter and more plentiful than in winter the former circumstance i should have expected from the less mixture during the dry season of cold water but the latter statement appears very strange and contradictory the periodical increase during the summer when rain never falls can i think only be accounted for by the melting of the snow yet the mountains which are covered by snow during that season are three or four leagues distant from the springs i have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my informer who having lived on the spot for several years ought to be well acquainted with the circumstancewhich if true certainly is very curious for we must suppose that the water being conducted through porous strata to the regions of heat is again thrown up to the surface by the line of dislocated and injected rock at cauquenes and the regularity of the phenomenon would seem to indicate that in this district heated rock occurred at a depth not excessively great one day i rode up the valley to the furthest inhabited spot shortly above that point the cachapual divides into two deep tremendous ravines which penetrate directly into the great range i scrambled up a peaked mountain probably more than six thousand feet high here as indeed every where else scenes of the highest interest presented themselves it was by one of these ravines that pincheira entered chile and ravaged the neighbouring country this is the same man whose attack on an estancia at the rio negro i have described he was a renegade halfcast spaniard who collected a great body of indians together and established himself by a stream in the pampas which place none of the forces sent after him could ever discover from this point he used to sally forth and crossing the cordillera by passes hitherto unattempted he ravaged the farmhouses and drove the cattle to his secret rendezvous pincheira was a capital horseman and he made all around him equally good for he invariably shot any one who hesitated to follow him it was against this man and other wandering indian tribes that rosas waged the war of extermination september thwe left the baths of cauquenes and rejoining the main road slept at the rio claro from this place we rode to the town of s fernando before arriving there the last basin had expanded into a great plain which extended so far to the south that the snowy summits of the more distant andes were seen as if above the horizon of the sea sfernando is forty leagues from santiago and it was my furthest point southward for we here turned at right angles towards the coast we slept at the goldmines of yaquil which are worked by mr nixon an american gentleman to whose kindness i was much indebted during the four days i staid at his house september ththis morning we rode to the mines which are situated at the distance of some leagues near the summit of a lofty hill on the way we had a glimpse of the lake taguatagua celebrated for its floating islands which have been described by m gay they are composed of the stalks of various dead plants intertwined together and on the surface of which other living ones take root their form is generally circular and their thickness from four to six feet of which the greater part is immersed in the water as the wind blows they pass from one side of the lake to the other and often carry cattle and horses as passengers when we arrived at the mine i was struck by the pale appearance of many of the men and inquired from mr nixon respecting their condition the mine is feet deep and each man brings up about pounds weight of stone with this load they have to climb up the alternate notches cut in the trunks of trees placed in a zigzag line up the shaft even beardless young men eighteen and twenty years old with little muscular development of their bodies they are quite naked excepting drawers ascend with this great load from nearly the same depth a strong man who is not accustomed to this labour perspires most profusely with merely carrying up his own body with this very severe labour they live entirely on boiled beans and bread they would prefer having the latter alone but their masters finding they cannot work so hard upon this treat them like horses and make them eat the beans their pay is here rather more than at the mines of jajuel being from to shillings per month they leave the mine only once in three weeks when they stay with their families for two days one of the rules in this mine sounds very harsh but answers pretty well for the master the only method of stealing gold is to secrete pieces of the ore and take them out as occasion may offer whenever the majordomo finds a lump thus hidden its full value is stopped out of the wages of all the men who thus without they all combine are obliged to keep watch over each other when the ore is brought to the mill it is ground into an impalpable powder the process of washing removes all the lighter particles and amalgamation finally secures the gold dust the washing when described sounds a very simple process but it is beautiful to see how the exact adaption of the current of water to the specific gravity of the gold so easily separates the powdered matrix from the metal the mud which passes from the mills is collected into pools where it subsides and every now and then is cleared out and thrown into a common heap a great deal of chemical action then commences salts of various kinds effloresce on the surface and the mass becomes hard in the heap which i examined an anguloconcretionary structure was also superinduced and what was very remarkable these pseudofragments possessed an even and welldefined slaty structure but the laminæ were not inclined at any uniform angle the mud after having been left for a year or two and then rewashed yields gold and this process may be repeated even six or seven times but the gold each time becomes less in quantity and the intervals required as the inhabitants say to generate the metal are longer there can be no doubt that the chemical action already mentioned each time liberates fresh gold from some combination the discovery of a method to effect this before the first grinding would without doubt raise the value of gold ores many fold it is curious to find how the minute particles of gold after being scattered about and from not corroding at last accumulate in some quantity a short time since a few miners being out of work obtained permission to scrape the ground round the house and mill they washed the earth thus got together and so procured thirty dollars worth of gold this is an exact counterpart of what takes place in nature mountains suffer degradation and wear away and with them the metallic veins which they contain the hardest rock is worn into impalpable mud the ordinary metals oxidate and both are removed but gold platina and a few others are nearly indestructible and from their weight sinking to the bottom are left behind after whole mountains have passed through this grinding mill and have been washed by the hand of nature the residue becomes metalliferous and man finds it worth his while to complete the task of separation there are some old indian ruins in this neighbourhood and i was shown one of the perforated stones which molina mentions as being found in many places in considerable numbers they are of a circular flattened form from five to six inches in diameter and with a hole passing quite through the centre it has generally been supposed that they were used as heads to clubs although their form does not appear at all well adapted for that purpose burchell states that some of the tribes in southern africa dig up roots by the aid of a pointed stick the force and weight of which is increased by a round stone with a hole into which the stick is firmly wedged it appears probable that the indians of chile formerly used some such rude agricultural instrument one day a german collector in natural history of the name of renous called and nearly at the same time an old spanish lawyer i was amused by afterwards hearing the conversation which took place between them renous speaks spanish so well that the old lawyer mistook him for a fellowcountryman renous alluding to myself asked him what he thought of the king of england sending out a collector to their country to pick up lizards and beetles and to break stones the old gentleman thought seriously for some time and then said it is not wellhay un gato encerrado aqui there is a cat shut up here no man is so rich as to send out people to pick up such rubbish i do not like it if one of us were to go and do such things in england do not you think the king of england would very soon send us out of his country and this old gentleman from his profession belongs to the better informed and more intelligent classes renous himself two or three years before left in a house at s fernando some caterpillars under charge of a girl to feed that they might turn into butterflies this was rumoured through the town and at last the padres and governor consulted together and agreed it must be some heresy accordingly when renous returned he was arrested september thwe left yaquil and followed the flat valley formed like that of quillota in which the rio tinderidica flows even at these few miles south of santiago the climate is much damper in consequence there were fine tracks of pasturage which were not irrigated th we followed this valley till it expanded into a great plain which reaches from the sea to the mountains west of rancagua we shortly lost all trees and even bushes so that the inhabitants are nearly as badly off for firewood as those in the pampas never having heard of these plains i was much surprised at meeting with such scenery in chile the plains belong to more than one series of different elevations and they are traversed by broad flatbottomed valleys both of which circumstances as in patagonia bespeak the gentle retreat of the ocean in the steep cliffs bordering these valleys there are some large caves which no doubt were formed by the waters of the ancient bays and channels one of these which i visited is celebrated under the name of cueva del obispo having formerly been consecrated during the day i felt very unwell and from that time till the end of october did not recover september dwe continued to pass over green plains without a tree the next day we arrived at a house near navedad on the seacoast where a rich haciendero gave us lodgings i stayed here the two ensuing days and although very unwell managed to collect from the tertiary formation some marine shells many of which turn out to be quite new forms th our course was now directed towards valparaiso which with great difficulty i reached on the th and was there confined to my bed till the end of october during this time i was an inmate in mr corfields house whose kindness to me i do not know how to express i will here add a few observations on some of the animals and birds of chile the puma or south american lion is not uncommon this animal has a wide geographical range being found from the equatorial forests throughout the deserts of patagonia as far south as the damp and cold latitudes to of tierra del fuego i have also seen its footsteps in the cordillera of central chile at an elevation of at least feet in la plata the puma chiefly preys on deer ostriches bizcacha and other small quadrupeds it there seldom attacks cattle or horses and except in most rare cases as a female having young is never dangerous to man in chile however it destroys many young horses and cattle owing probably to the scarcity of other quadrupeds i heard likewise of two men and a woman who had been killed by them it is asserted that the puma always kills its prey by springing on the shoulders and then drawing back the head with one of its paws until the vertebræ break i have seen in patagonia the skeletons of guanacoes with their necks thus dislocated the puma after eating its fill covers the carcass with many large bushes and lies down to watch it this habit is often the cause of its being discovered for the condors wheeling in the air every now and then descend to partake of the feast and being angrily driven away rise all together on the wing the chileno guaso then knows there is a lion watching his preythe word is givenand men and dogs hurry to the chase sir f head says that a gaucho in the pampas upon merely seeing some condors wheeling in the air cried a lion i could never myself meet with any one who pretended to such powers of discrimination it is asserted that if a puma has once been betrayed by thus watching the carcass and has then been hunted it never resumes this habit but that having gorged itself it wanders far away the puma is easily killed in an open country it is first entangled with the bolas then lazoed and dragged along the ground till rendered insensible at tandeel south of the plata i was told that within three months one hundred were destroyed in chile they are generally driven up bushes or trees and are then either shot or baited to death by dogs the dogs employed in this chase belong to a particular breed called leoneros they are weak slight animals like longlegged terriers but are born with a particular instinct for this sport the puma is described as being very crafty when pursued it often returns on its former track and then suddenly making a spring on one side waits there till the dogs have passed by it is a very silent animal uttering no cry even when wounded and only rarely during the breeding season of birds two species of the genus pteroptochos megapodius and albicollis of kittlitz are perhaps the most conspicuous the former called by the chilenos el turco is as large as a fieldfare to which bird it has some alliance but its legs are much longer tail shorter and beak stronger its colour is a reddish brown the turco is not uncommon it lives on the ground sheltered among the thickets which are scattered over the dry and sterile hills with its tail erect and stiltlike legs it may be seen every now and then popping from one bush to another with uncommon celerity it really requires little imagination to believe the bird is ashamed of itself and is aware of its most ridiculous figure on first seeing it one is tempted to exclaim a vilely stuffed specimen has escaped from some museum and has come to life again it cannot be made to take flight without the greatest trouble nor does it run but only hops the various loud cries which it utters when concealed amongst the bushes are as strange as its whole appearance it is said to build its nest in a deep hole beneath the ground i dissected several specimens the gizzard which was very muscular contained beetles vegetable fibres and pebbles from this character from the length of legs scratching feet membranous covering to the nostrils short and arched wings this bird seems to a certain degree to connect the thrushes with the gallinaceous order the second species or pt albicollis is allied to the first in its general form it is called tapacolo or cover your
