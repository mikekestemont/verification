is ten or fifteen miles wide and is said to extend for miles northward its surface is nearly feet above the sea it is composed to a thickness of some hundred feet of loosely aggregated stratified shingle which is prolonged with a gently sloping surface up the valleys in the mountains on both sides one section in this plain z is interesting from the unusual circumstance of alternating layers of almost loose red and white sand with lines of pebbles from the size of a nut to that of an apple and beds of gravel being inclined at an angle of and in some spots even at a higher angle these beds are dislocated by small faults and are capped by a thick mass of horizontally stratified gravel evidently of subaqueous origin having been accustomed to observe the irregularities of beds accumulated under currents i feel sure that the inclination here has not been thus produced the pebbles consist chiefly of the brickred porphyry just described and of white granite both probably derived from the ranges to the west and of altered clayslate and of certain porphyries apparently belonging to the rocks of the uspallata chain this plain corresponds geographically with the valley of tenuyan between the portillo and peuquenes ranges but in that valley the shingle which likewise has been derived both from the eastern and western ranges has been cemented into a hard conglomerate and has been throughout tilted at a considerable inclination the gravel there apparently attains a much greater thickness and is probably of higher antiquity the uspallata rangethe road by the villa vicencio pass does not strikedirectly across the range but runs for some leagues northward along its western base and i must briefly describe the rocks here seen before continuing with the coloured east and west section at the mouth of the valley of cañota and at several points northwards there is an extensive formation of a glossy and harsh and of a feldspathic clayslate including strata of grauwacke and having a tortuous nearly vertical cleavage traversed by numerous metalliferous veins and others of quartz the clayslate is in many parts capped by a thick mass of fragments of the same rock firmly recemented and both together have been injected and broken up by very numerous hillocks ranging north and south of lilac white dark and salmoncoloured porphyries one steep now denuded hillock of porphyry had its face as distinctly impressed with the angles of a fragmentary mass of the slate with some of the points still remaining embedded as sealingwax could be by a seal at the mouth of this same valley of cañota in a fine escarpment having the strata dipping from to to the ne the clayslate formation is seen to be covered by st a purple claystone porphyry resting unconformably in some parts on the solid slate and in others on a thick fragmentary mass nd a conformable stratum of compact blackish rock having a spheroidal structure full of minute acicular crystals of glassy feldspar with red spots of oxide of iron rd a great stratum of purplishred claystone porphyry abounding with crystals of opaque feldspar and laminated with thin parallel often short layers and likewise with great irregular patches of white earthy semicrystalline feldspar this rock which i noticed in other neighbouring places perfectly resembles a curious variety described at port desire and occasionally occurs in the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of chile th a thin stratum of greenishwhite indurated tuff fusible and containing broken crystals and particles of porphyries th a grand mass imperfectly columnar and divided into three parallel and closely joined strata of creamcoloured claystone porphyry th a thick stratum of lilaccoloured porphyry which i could see was capped by another bed of the creamcoloured variety i was unable to examine the still higher parts of the escarpment these conformably stratified porphyries though none are either vesicular or amygdaloidal have evidently flowed as submarine lavas some of them are separated from each other by seams of indurated tuff which however are quite insignificant in thickness compared with the porphyries this whole pile resembles but not very closely some of the less brecciated parts of the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of chile but it does not probably belong to the same age as the porphyries here rest unconformably on the altered feldspathic clayslate whereas the porphyritic conglomerate formation alternates with and rests conformably on it these porphyries moreover with the exception of the one blackish stratum and of the one indurated white tufaceous bed differ from the beds composing the uspallata range in the line of the villa vicencio pass i will now give first a sketch of the structure of the range as represented in the coloured section and will then describe its composition and interesting history at its western foot a hillock n is seen to rise out of the plain with its strata dipping at to the west fronted by strata o inclined at to the east thus forming a little north and south anticlinal axis some other little hillocks of similar composition with their strata highly inclined range ne and sw obliquely to the main uspallata line the cause of these dislocations which though on a small scale have been violent and complicated is seen to lie in hummocks of lilac purple and red porphyries which have been injected in a liquefied state through and into the underlying clayslate formation several dikes were exposed here but in no other part that i saw of this range as the strata consist of black white greenish and brown coloured rocks and as the intrusive porphyries are so brightly tinted a most extraordinary view was presented like a coloured geological drawing on the gently inclined main western slope p p above the little anticlinal ridges just mentioned the strata dip at an average angle of to the west the inclination in some places being only in some few others as much as the masses having these different inclinations are separated from each other by parallel vertical faults as represented at pa often giving rise to separate parallel uniclinal ridges the summit of the main range is broad and undulatory with the stratification undulatory and irregular in a few places granitic and porphyritic masses q protrude which from the small effect they have locally produced in deranging the strata probably form the upper points of a regular great underlying dome these denuded granitic points i estimated at about feet in height above the sea on the eastern slope the strata in the upper part are regularly inclined at about to the east so that the summit of this chain neglecting small irregularities forms a broad anticlinal axis lower down however near los hornillos r there is a wellmarked synclinal axis beyond which the strata are inclined at nearly the same angle namely from to inwards or westward owing to the amount of denudation which this chain has suffered the outline of the gently inclined eastern flank scarcely offers the slightest indication of this synclinal axis the stratified beds which we have hitherto followed across the range a little farther down are seen to lie i believe unconformably on a broad mountainous band of clayslate and grauwacke the strata and laminæ of this latter formation on the extreme eastern flank are generally nearly vertical further inwards they become inclined from to to the west near villa vicencio s there is apparently an anticlinal axis but the structure of this outer part of the clayslate formation is so obscure that i have not marked the planes of stratification in the coloured section on the margin of the pampas some low much dislocated spurs of this same formation project in a northeasterly line in the same oblique manner as do the ridges on the western foot and as is so frequently the case with those at the base of the main cordillera i will now describe the nature of the beds beginning at the base on the eastern side first for the clayslate formation the slate is generally hard and bluish with the laminæ coated by minute micaceous scales it alternates many times with a coarsegrained greenish grauwacke containing rounded fragments of quartz and bits of slate in a slightly calcareous basis the slate in the upper part generally becomes purplish and the cleavage so irregular that the whole consists of mere splinters transverse veins of quartz are numerous at the calera some leagues distant there is a dark crystalline limestone apparently included in this formation with the exception of the grauwacke being here more abundant and the clayslate less altered this formation closely resembles that unconformably underlying the porphyries at the western foot of this same range and likewise that alternating with the porphyritic conglomerate in the main cordillera this formation is a considerable one and extends several leagues southward to near mendoza the mountains composed of it rise to a height of about feet above the edge of the pampas or about feet above the sea secondly the most usual bed on the clayslate is a coarse white slightly calcareous conglomerate of no great thickness including broken crystals of feldspar grains of quartz and numerous pebbles of brecciated claystone porphyry but without any pebbles of the underlying clayslate i nowhere saw the actual junction between this bed and the clayslate though i spent a whole day in endeavouring to discover their relations in some places i distinctly saw the white conglomerate and overlying beds inclined at from to to the west and at the bottom of the same mountain the clayslate and grauwacke inclined to the same point but at an angle from to in one instance the clayslate dipped not only at a different angle but to a different point from the overlying formation in these cases the two formations certainly appeared quite unconformable moreover i found in the clayslate one great vertical dikelike fissure filled up with an indurated whitish tuff quite similar to some of the upper beds presently to be described and this shows that the clayslate must have been consolidated and dislocated before their deposition on the other hand the stratification of the slate and grauwacke in some cases gradually and entirely disappeared in approaching the overlying white conglomerate in other cases the stratification of the two formations became strictly conformable and again in other cases there was some tolerably well characterised clayslate lying above the conglomerate the most probable conclusion appears to be that after the clayslate formation had been dislocated and tilted but whilst under the sea a fresh and more recent deposition of clayslate took place on which the white conglomerate was conformably deposited with here and there a thin intercalated bed of clayslate on this view the white conglomerates and the presently to be described tuffs and lavas are really unconformable to the main part of the clayslate and this as we have seen certainly is the case with the claystone lavas in the valley of cañota at the western and opposite base of the range thirdly on the white conglomerate strata several hundred feet in thickness are superimposed varying much in nature in short distances the commonest variety is a white much indurated tuff sometimes slightly calcareous with ferruginous spots and waterlines often passing into whitish or purplish compact finegrained grit or sandstones other varieties become semiporcellanic and tinted faint green or blue others pass into an indurated shale most of these varieties are easily fusible fourthly a bed about feet thick of a compact partially columnar palegray feldspathic lava stained with iron including very numerous crystals of opaque feldspar and with some crystallised and disseminated calcareous matter the tufaceous stratum on which this feldspathic lava rests is much hardened stained purple and has a sphericoconcretionary structure it here contains a good many pebbles of claystone porphyry fifthly thin beds feet in thickness varying much in nature consisting of white and ferruginous tuffs in some parts having a concretionary structure in others containing rounded grains and a few pebbles of quartz also passing into hard gritstones and into greenish mudstones there is also much of a bluishgray and green semiporcellanic stone sixthly a volcanic stratum feet in thickness of so varying a nature that i do not believe a score of specimens would show all the varieties much is highly amygdaloidal much compact there are greenish blackish purplish and gray varieties rarely including crystals of green augite and minute acicular ones of feldspar but often crystals and amygdaloidal masses of white red and black carbonate of lime some of the blackish varieties of this rock have a conchoidal fracture and resemble basalt others have an irregular fracture some of the gray and purplish varieties are thickly speckled with green earth and with white crystalline carbonate of lime others are largely amygdaloidal with green earth and calcareous spar again other earthy varieties of greenish purplish and gray tints contain much iron and are almost half composed of amygdaloidal balls of dark brown bole of a whitish indurated feldspathic matter of bright green earth of agate and of black and white crystallised carbonate of lime all these varieties are easily fusible viewed from a distance the line of junction with the underlying semiporcellanic strata was distinct but when examined closely it was impossible to point out within a foot where the lava ended and where the sedimentary mass began the rock at the time of junction was in most places hard of a bright green colour and abounded with irregular amygdaloidal masses of ferruginous and pure calcareous spar and of agate seventhly strata eighty feet in thickness of various indurated tuffs as before many of the varieties have a fine basis including rather coarse extraneous particles some of them are compact and semiporcellanic and include vegetable impressions eighthly a bed about fifty feet thick of greenishgray compact feldspathic lava with numerous small crystals of opaque feldspar black augite and oxide of iron the junction with the bed on which it rested was ill defined balls and masses of the feldspathic rock being enclosed in much altered tuff ninthly indurated tuffs as before tenthly a conformable layer less than two feet in thickness of pitchstone generally brecciated and traversed by veins of agate and of carbonate of lime parts are composed of apparently concretionary fragments of a more perfect variety arranged in horizontal lines in a less perfectly characterised variety i have much difficulty in believing that this thin layer of pitchstone flowed as lava eleventhly sedimentary and tufaceous beds as before passing into sandstone including some conglomerate the pebbles in the latter are of claystone porphyry well rounded and some as large as cricketballs twelfthly a bed of compact sonorous feldspathic lava like that of bed no divided by numerous joints into large angular blocks thirteenthly sedimentary beds as before fourteenthly a thick bed of greenish or grayish black compact basalt fusing into a black enamel with small crystals occasionally distinguishable of feldspar and augite the junction with the underlying sedimentary bed differently from that in most of the foregoing streams here was quite distinctthe lava and tufaceous matter preserving their perfect characters within two inches of each other this rock closely resembles certain parts of that varied and singular lavastream no it likewise resembles as we shall immediately see many of the great upper beds on the western flank and on the summit of this range the pile of strata here described attains a great thickness and above the lastmentioned volcanic stratum there were several other great tufaceous beds alternating with submarine lavas which i had not time to examine but a corresponding series several thousand feet in thickness is well exhibited on the crest and western flank of the range most of the lavastreams on the western side are of a jetblack colour and basaltic nature they are either compact and finegrained including minute crystals of augite and feldspar or they are coarsegrained and abound with rather large copperybrown crystals of an augitic mineral another variety was of a dullred colour having a claystone brecciated basis including specks of oxide of iron and of calcareous spar and amygdaloidal with green earth there were apparently several other varieties these submarine lavas often exhibit a spheroidal and sometimes an imperfect columnar structure their upper junctions are much more clearly defined than their lower junctions but the latter are not so much blended into the underlying sedimentary beds as is the case in the eastern flank on the crest and western flank of the range the streams viewed as a whole are mostly basaltic whilst those on the eastern side which stand lower in the series are as we have seen mostly feldspathic the sedimentary strata alternating with the lavas on the crest and western side are of an almost infinitely varying nature but a large proportion of them closely resemble those already described on the eastern flank there are white and brown indurated easily fusible tuffssome passing into pale blue and green semiporcellanic rocksothers into brownish and purplish sandstones and gritstones often including grains of quartzothers into mudstone containing broken crystals and particles of rock and occasionally single large pebbles there was one stratum of a bright red coarse volcanic gritstone another of conglomerate another of a black indurated carbonaceous shale marked with imperfect vegetable impressions this latter bed which was thin rested on a submarine lava and followed all the considerable inequalities of its upper surface mr miers states that coal has been found in this range lastly there was a bed like no on the eastern flank evidently of sedimentary origin and remarkable from closely approaching in character to an imperfect pitchstone and from including extremely thin layers of perfect pitchstone as well as nodules and irregular fragments but not resembling extraneous fragments of this same rock arranged in horizontal lines i conceive that this bed which is only a few feet in thickness must have assumed its present state through metamorphic and concretionary action most of these sedimentary strata are much indurated and no doubt have been partially metamorphosed many of them are extraordinarily heavy and compact others have agate and crystalline carbonate of lime disseminated throughout them some of the beds exhibit a singular concretionary arrangement with the curves determined by the lines of fissure there are many veins of agate and calcareous spar and innumerable ones of iron and other metals which have blackened and curiously affected the strata to considerable distances on both sides many of these tufaceous beds resemble with the exception of being more indurated the upper beds of the great patagonian tertiary formation especially those variously coloured layers high up the river santa cruz and in a remarkable degree the tufaceous formation at the northern end of chiloe i was so much struck with this resemblance that i particularly looked out for silicified wood and found it under the following extraordinary circumstances high up on this western flank at a height estimated at feet above the sea in a broken escarpment of thin strata composed of compact green gritstone passing into a fine mudstone and alternating with layers of coarser brownish very heavy mudstone including broken crystals and particles of rock almost blended together i counted the stumps of fiftytwo trees they projected between two and five feet above the ground and stood at exactly right angles to the strata which were here inclined at an angle of about to the west eleven of these trees were silicified and well preserved mr r brown has been so kind as to examine the wood when sliced and polished he says it is coniferous partaking of the characters of the araucarian tribe with some curious points of affinity with the yew the bark round the trunks must have been circularly furrowed with irregular lines for the mudstone round them is thus plainly marked one cast consisted of dark argillaceous limestone and forty of them of coarsely crystallised carbonate of lime with cavities lined by quartz crystals these latter white calcareous columns do not retain any internal structure but their external form plainly shows their origin all the stumps have nearly the same diameter varying from one foot to eighteen inches some of them stand within a yard of each other they are grouped in a clump within a space of about sixty yards across with a few scattered round at the distance of yards they all stand at about the same level the longest stump stood seven feet out of the ground the roots if they are still preserved are buried and concealed no one layer of the mudstone appeared much darker than the others as if it had formerly existed as soil nor could this be expected for the same agents which replaced with silex and lime the wood of the trees would naturally have removed all vegetable matter from the soil besides the fiftytwo upright trees there were a few fragments like broken branches horizontally embedded the surrounding strata are crossed by veins of carbonate of lime agate and oxide of iron and a poor gold vein has been worked not far from the trees the green and brown mudstone beds including the trees are conformably covered by much indurated compact white or ferruginous tuffs which pass upwards into a finegrained purplish sedimentary rock these strata which together are from to feet in thickness rest on a thick bed of submarinelava and are conformably covered by another great mass of finegrained basalt which i estimated at feet in thickness and which probably has been formed by more than one stream above this mass i could clearly distinguish five conformable alternations each several hundred feet in thickness of stratified sedimentary rocks and lavas such as have been previously described certainly the upright trees have been buried under several thousand feet in thickness of matter accumulated under the sea as the trees obviously must once have grown on dry land what an enormous amount of subsidence is thus indicated nevertheless had it not been for the trees there was no appearance which would have led any one even to have conjectured that these strata had subsided as the land moreover on which the trees grew is formed of subaqueous deposits of nearly if not quite equal thickness with the superincumbent strata and as these deposits are regularly stratified and finegrained not like the matter thrown up on a seabeach a previous upward movement aided no doubt by the great accumulation of lavas and sediment is also indicated in nearly the middle of the range there are some hills q before alluded to formed of a kind of granite externally resembling andesite and consisting of a white imperfectly granular feldspathic basis including some perfect crystals apparently of albite but i was unable to measure them much black mica epidote in veins and very little or no quartz numerous small veins branch from this rock into the surrounding strata and it is a singular fact that these veins though composed of the same kind of feldspar and small scales of mica as in the solid rock abound with innumerable minute rounded grains of quartz in the veins or dikes also branching from the great granitic axis in the peninsula of tres montes i observed that quartz was more abundant in them than in the main rock i have heard of other analogous cases can we account for this fact by the longcontinued vicinity of quartz when cooling and by its having been thus more easily sucked into fissures than the other constituent minerals of granite the strata encasing the flanks of these granitic or andesitic masses and forming a thick cap on one of their summits appear originally to have been of the same tufaceous nature with the beds already described but they are now changed into porcellanic jaspery and crystalline rocks and into others of a white colour with a harsh texture and having a siliceous aspect though really of a feldspathic nature and fusible both the granitic intrusive masses and the encasing strata are penetrated by innumerable metallic veins mostly ferruginous and auriferous but some containing copperpyrites and a few silver near the veins the rocks are blackened as if blasted by gunpowder the strata are only slightly dislocated close round these hills and hence perhaps it may be inferred that the granitic masses form only the projecting points of a broad continuous axisdome which has given to the upper parts of this range its anticlinal structure concluding remarks on the uspallata rangei will not attempt to estimate the total thickness of the pile of strata forming this range but it must amount to many thousand feet the sedimentary and tufaceous beds have throughout a general similarity though with infinite variations the submarine lavas in the lower part of the series are mostly feldspathic whilst in the upper part on the summit and western flank they are mostly basaltic we are thus reminded of the relative position in most recent volcanic districts of the trachytic and basaltic lavasthe latter from their greater weight having sunk to a lower level in the earths crust and having consequently been erupted at a later period over the lighter and upper lavas of the trachytic series both the basaltic and feldspathic submarine streams are very compact none being vesicular and only a few amygdaloidal the effects which some of them especially those low in the series have produced on the tufaceous beds over which they have flowed is highly curious independently of this local metamorphic action all the strata undoubtedly display an indurated and altered character and all the rocks of this rangethe lavas the alternating sediments the intrusive granite and porphyries and the underlying clayslateare intersected by metalliferous veins the lavastrata can often be seen extending for great distances conformably with the under and overlying beds and it was obvious that they thickened towards the west hence the points of eruption must have been situated westward of the present range in the direction of the main cordillera as however the flanks of the cordillera are entirely composed of various porphyries chiefly claystone and greenstone some intrusive and others belonging to the porphyritic conglomerate formation but all quite unlike these submarine lavastreams we must in all probability look to the plain of uspallata for the now deeply buried points of eruption comparing our section of the uspallata range with that of the cumbre we see with the exception of the underlying clayslate and perhaps of the intrusive rocks of the axes a striking dissimilarity in the strata composing them the great porphyritic conglomerate formation has not extended as far as this range nor have we here any of the gypseous strata the magnesian and other limestones the red sandstones the siliceous beds with pebbles of quartz and comparatively little of the conglomerates all of which form such vast masses over the basal series in the main cordillera on the other hand in the cordillera we do not find those endless varieties of indurated tuffs with their numerous veins and concretionary arrangement and those grit and mud stones and singular semiporcellanic rocks so abundant in the uspallata range the submarine lavas also differ considerably the feldspathic streams of the cordillera contain much mica which is absent in those of the uspallata range in this latter range we have seen on how grand a scale basaltic lava has been poured forth of which there is not a trace in the cordillera this dissimilarity is the more striking considering that these two parallel chains are separated by a plain only between ten and fifteen miles in width and that the uspallata lavas as well as no doubt the alternating tufaceous beds have proceeded from the west from points apparently between the two ranges to imagine that these two piles of strata were contemporaneously deposited in two closely adjoining very deep submarine areas separated from each other by a lofty ridge where a plain now extends would be a gratuitous hypothesis and had they been contemporaneously deposited without any such dividing ridge surely some of the gypseous and other sedimentary matter forming such immensely thick masses in the cordillera would have extended this short distance eastwards and surely some of the uspallata tuffs and basalts also accumulated to so great a thickness would have extended a little westward hence i conclude that it is far more probable that these two series are not contemporaneous but that the strata of one of the chains were deposited and even the chain itself uplifted before the formation of the otherwhich chain then is the oldest considering that in the uspallata range the lowest strata on the western flank lie unconformably on the clayslate as probably is the case with those on the eastern flank whereas in the cordillera all the overlying strata lie conformably on this formationconsidering that in the uspallata range some of the beds both low down and high up in the series are marked with vegetable impressions showing the continued existence of neighbouring landconsidering the close general resemblance between the deposits of this range and those of tertiary origin in several parts of the continentand lastly even considering the lesser height and outlying position of the uspallata rangei conclude that the strata composing it are in all probability of subsequent origin and that they were accumulated at a period when a deep sea studded with submarine volcanos washed the eastern base of the already partially elevated cordillera this conclusion is of much importance for we have seen that in the cordillera during the deposition of the neocomian strata the bed of the sea must have subsided many thousand feet we now learn that at a later period an adjoining area first received a great accumulation of strata and was upheaved into land on which coniferous trees grew and that this area then subsided several thousand feet to receive the superincumbent submarine strata afterwards being broken up denuded and elevated in mass to its present height i am strengthened in this conclusion of there having been two distinct great periods of subsidence by reflecting on the thick mass of coarse stratified conglomerate in the valley of tenuyan between the peuquenes and portillo lines for the accumulation of this mass seems to me as previously remarked almost necessarily to have required a prolonged subsidence and this subsidence from the pebbles in the conglomerate having been to a great extent derived from the gypseous or neocomian strata of the peuquenes line we know must have been quite distinct from and subsequent to that sinking movement which probably accompanied the deposition of the peuquenes strata and which certainly accompanied the deposition of the equivalent beds near the puente del inca in this line of section the uspallata chain corresponds in geographical position though on a small scale with the portillo line and its clayslate formation is probably the equivalent of the micaschist of the portillo there metamorphosed by the old white granites and syenites the coloured beds under the conglomerate in the valley of tenuyan of which traces are seen on the crest of the portillo and even the conglomerate itself may perhaps be synchronous with the tufaceous beds and submarine lavas of the uspallata range an open sea and volcanic action in the latter case and a confined channel between two bordering chains of islets in the former case having been sufficient to account for the mineralogical dissimilarity of the two series from this correspondence between the uspallata and portillo ranges perhaps in age and certainly in geographical position one is tempted to consider the one range as the prolongation of the other but their axes are formed of totally different intrusive rocks and we have traced the apparent continuation of the red granite of the portillo in the red porphyries diverging into the main cordillera whether the axis of the uspallata range was injected before or as perhaps is more probable after that of the portillo line i will not pretend to decide but it is well to remember that the highly inclined lavastreams on the eastern flank of the portillo line prove that its angular upheavement was not a single and sudden event and therefore that the anticlinal elevation of the uspallata range may have been contemporaneous with some of the later angular movements by which the gigantic portillo range gained its present height above the adjoining plain chapter xv northern chileconclusion section from illapel to combarbala

granites syenites greenstones and altered feldspathic clayslate near coquimbo there is much hornblendic rock and various duskycoloured porphyries i will describe only one section in this district namely from near illapel in a ne line to the mines of los hornos and thence in a north by east direction to combarbala at the foot of the main cordillera near illapel after passing for some distance over granite andesite and andesitic porphyry we come to a greenish stratified feldspathic rock which i believe is altered clayslate conformably capped by porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate of great thickness dipping at an average angle of to ne by n the uppermost beds consist of conglomerates and sandstone only a little metamorphosed and conformably covered by a gypseous formation of very great thickness but much denuded this gypseous formation where first met with lies in a broad valley or basin a little southward of the mines of los hornos the lower half alone contains gypsum not in great masses as in the cordillera but in innumerable thin layers seldom more than an inch or two in thickness the gypsum is either opaque or transparent and is associated with carbonate of lime the layers alternate with numerous varying ones of a calcareous clayshale with strong aluminous odour adhering to the tongue easily fusible into a pale green glass more or less indurated either earthy and cream coloured or greenish and hard the more indurated varieties have a compact homogeneous almost crystalline fracture and contain granules of crystallised oxide of iron some of the varieties almost resemble honestones there is also a little black hardly fusible siliceocalcareous clayslate like some of the varieties alternating with gypsum on the peuquenes range the upper half of this gypseous formation is mainly formed of the same calcareous clayshale rock but without any gypsum and varying extremely in nature it passes from a soft coarse earthy ferruginous state including particles of quartz into compact claystones with crystallised oxide of ironinto porcellanic layers alternating with seams of calcareous matterand into green porcelainjasper excessively hard but easily fusible strata of this nature alternate with much black and brown siliceocalcareous slate remarkable from the wonderful number of huge embedded logs of silicified wood this wood according to mr r brown is judging from several specimens all coniferous some of the layers of the black siliceous slate contained irregular angular fragments of imperfect pitchstone which i believe as in the uspallata range has originated in a metamorphic process there was one bed of a marly tufaceous nature and of little specific gravity veins of agate and calcareous spar are numerous the whole of this gypseous formation especially the upper half has been injected metamorphosed and locally contorted by numerous hillocks of intrusive porphyries crowded together in an extraordinary manner these hillocks consist of purple claystone and of various other porphyries and of much white feldspathic greenstone passing into andesite this latter variety included in one case crystals of orthitic and albitic feldspar touching each other and others of hornblende chlorite and epidote the strata surrounding these intrusive hillocks at the mines of los hornos are intersected by many veins of copperpyrites associated with much micaceous ironore and by some of gold in the neighbourhood of these veins the rocks are blackened and much altered the gypsum near the intrusive masses is always opaque one of these hillocks of porphyry was capped by some stratified porphyritic conglomerate which must have been brought up from below through the whole immense thickness of the overlying gypseous formation the lower beds of the gypseous formation resemble the corresponding and probably contemporaneous strata of the main cordillera whilst the upper beds in several respects resemble those of the uspallata chain and possibly may be contemporaneous with them for i have endeavoured to show that the uspallata beds were accumulated subsequently to the gypseous or neocomian formations of the cordillera this pile of strata dips at an angle of about to ne by n close up to the very foot of the cuesta de los hornos a crooked range of mountains formed of intrusive rocks of the same nature with the above described hillocks only in one or two places on this southeastern side of the range i noticed a narrow fringe of the upper gypseous strata brushed up and inclined southeastward from it on its northeastern flank and likewise on a few of the summits the stratified porphyritic conglomerate is inclined ne so that if we disregard the very narrow anticlinal fringe of gypseous strata at its se foot this range forms a second uniclinal axis of elevation proceeding in a north by east direction to the village of combarbala we come to a third escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate dipping eastwards and forming the outer range of the main cordillera the lower beds were here more jaspery than usual and they included some white cherty strata and red sandstones alternating with purple claystone porphyry higher up in the cordillera there appeared to be a line of andesitic rocks and beyond them a fourth escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate again dipping eastwards or inwards the overlying gypseous strata if they ever existed here have been entirely removed copper mines of panuncillofrom combarbala to coquimbo i traversed the country in a zigzag direction crossing and recrossing the porphyritic conglomerate and finding in the granitic districts an unusual number of mountainmasses composed of various intrusive porphyritic rocks many of them andesitic one common variety was greenishblack with large crystals of blackish albite at panuncillo a short nnw and sse ridge with a nucleus formed of greenstone and of a slatecoloured porphyry including crystals of glassy feldspar deserves notice from the very singular nature of the almost vertical strata composing it these consist chiefly of a finer or coarser granular mixture not very compact of white carbonate of lime of protoxide of iron and of yellowish garnets ascertained by prof miller each grain being an almost perfect crystal some of the varieties consist exclusively of granules of the calcareous spar and some contain grains of copper ore and i believe of quartz these strata alternate with a bluish compact fusible feldspathic rock much of the above granular mixture has also a pseudobrecciated structure in which fragments are obscurely arranged in planes parallel to those of the stratification and are conspicuous on the weathered surfaces the fragments are angular or rounded small or large and consist of bluish or reddish compact feldspathic matter in which a few acicular crystals of feldspar can sometimes be seen the fragments often blend at their edges into the surrounding granular mass and seem due to a kind of concretionary action these singular rocks are traversed by many copper veins and appear to rest conformably on a granular mixture in parts as finegrained as a sandstone of quartz mica hornblende and feldspar and this on finegrained common gneiss and this on a laminated mass composed of pinkish orthitic feldspar including a few specks of hornblende and lastly this on granite which together with andesitic rocks form the surrounding district coquimbo mining district of arquerosat coquimbo the porphyritic conglomerate formation approaches nearer to the pacific than in any other part of chile visited by me being separated from the coast by a tract only a few miles broad of the usual plutonic rocks with the addition of a porphyry having a red euritic base in proceeding to the mines of arqueros the strata of porphyritic conglomerate are at first nearly horizontal an unusual circumstance and afterwards they dip gently to sse after having ascended to a considerable height we come to an undulatory district in which the famous silver mines are situated my examination was chiefly confined to those of s rosa most of the rocks in this district are stratified dipping in various directions and many of them are of so singular a nature that at the risk of being tedious i must briefly describe them the commonest variety is a dullred compact finelybrecciated stone containing much iron and innumerable white crystallised particles of carbonate of lime and minute extraneous fragments another variety is almost equally common near s rosa it has a bright green scanty basis including distinct crystals and patches of white carbonate of lime and grains of red semimicaceous oxide of iron in parts the basis becomes dark green and assumes an obscure crystalline arrangement and occasionally in parts it becomes soft and slightly translucent like soapstone these red and green rocks are often quite distinct and often pass into each other the passage being sometimes affected by a fine brecciated structure particles of the red and green matter being mingled together some of the varieties appear gradually to become porphyritic with feldspar and all of them are easily fusible into pale or darkcoloured beads strongly attracted by the magnet i should perhaps have mistaken several of these stratified rocks for submarine lavas like some of those described at the puente del inca had i not examined a few leagues eastward of this point a fine series of analogous but less metamorphosed sedimentary beds belonging to the gypseous formation and probably derived from a volcanic source this formation is intersected by numerous metalliferous veins running though irregularly nw and se and generally at right angles to the many dikes the veins consist of native silver of muriate of silver an amalgam of silver cobalt antimony and arsenic generally embedded in sulphate of barytes i was assured by mr lambert that native copper without a trace of silver has been found in the same vein with native silver without a trace of copper at the mines of aristeas the silver veins are said to be unproductive as soon as they pass into the green strata whereas at s rosa only two or three miles distant the reverse happens and at the time of my visit the miners were working through a red stratum in the hopes of the vein becoming productive in the underlying green sedimentary mass i have a specimen of one of these green rocks with the usual granules of white calcareous spar and red oxide of iron abounding with disseminated particles of glittering native and muriate of silver yet taken at the distance of one yard from any veina circumstance as i was assured of very rare occurrence section eastward up the valley of coquimboafter passing for a few miles over the coast granitic series we come to the porphyritic conglomerate with its usual characters and with some of the beds distinctly displaying their mechanical origin the strata where first met with are as before stated only slightly inclined but near the hacienda of pluclaro we come to an anticlinal axis with the beds much dislocated and shifted by a great fault of which not a trace is externally seen in the outline of the hill i believe that this anticlinal axis can be traced northwards into the district of arqueros where a conspicuous hill called cerro blanco formed of a harsh creamcoloured euritic rock including a few crystals of reddish feldspar and associated with some purplish claystone porphyry seems to fall on a line of elevation in descending from the arqueros district i crossed on the northern border of the valley strata inclined eastward from the pluclaro axis on the porphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass some hundred feet thick of brown argillaceous limestone in parts crystalline and in parts almost composed of hippurites chilensis dorbig above this came a black calcareous shale and on it a red conglomerate in the brown limestone with the hippurites there was an impression of a pecten and a coral and great numbers of a large gryphæa very like and according to prof e forbes probably identical with g orientalis forbes msa cretaceous species probably upper greensand from verdachellum in southern india these fossils seem to occupy nearly the same position with those at the puente del incanamely at the top of the porphyritic conglomerate and at the base of the gypseous formation a little above the hacienda of pluclaro i made a détour on the northern side of the valley to examine the superincumbent gypseous strata which i estimated at feet in thickness the uppermost beds of the porphyritic conglomerate on which the gypseous strata conformably rest are variously coloured with one very singular and beautiful stratum composed of purple pebbles of various kinds of porphyry embedded in white calcareous spar including cavities lined with brightgreen crystallised epidote the whole pile of strata belonging to both formations is inclined apparently from the abovementioned axis of pluclaro at an angle of between and to the east i will here give a section of the principal beds met with in crossing the entire thickness of the gypseous strata first above the porphyritic conglomerate formation there is a finegrained red crystalline sandstone secondly a thick mass of smoothgrained calcareoaluminous shaly rock often marked with dendritic manganese and having where most compact the external appearance of honestone it is easily fusible i shall for the future for convenience sake call this variety pseudohonestone some of the varieties are quite black when freshly broken but all weather into a yellowishash coloured soft earthy substance precisely as is the case with the compact shaly rocks of the peuquenes range this stratum is of the same general nature with many of the beds near los hornos in the illapel section in this second bed or in the underlying red sandstone for the surface was partially concealed by detritus there was a thick mass of gypsum having the same mineralogical characters with the great beds described in our sections across the cordillera thirdly a thick stratum of finegrained red sedimentary matter easily fusible into a white glass like the basis of claystone porphyry but in parts jaspery in parts brecciated and including crystalline specks of carbonate of lime in some of the jaspery layers and in some of the black siliceous slaty bands there were irregular seams of imperfect pitchstone undoubtedly of metamorphic origin and other seams of brown crystalline limestone here also were masses externally resembling illpreserved silicified wood fourthly and fifthly calcareous pseudohonestone and a thick stratum concealed by detritus sixthly a thinly stratified mass of bright green compact smoothgrained calcareoargillaceous stone easily fusible and emitting a strong aluminous odour the whole has a highly anguloconcretionary structure and it resembles to a certain extent some of the upper tufaccoinfusorial deposits of the patagonian tertiary formation it is in its nature allied to our pseudohonestone and it includes well characterised layers of that variety and other layers of a pale green harder and brecciated variety and others of red sedimentary matter like that of bed three some pebbles of porphyries are embedded in the upper part seventhly red sedimentary matter or sandstone like that of bed one several hundred feet in thickness and including jaspery layers often having a finely brecciated structure eighthly white much indurated almost crystalline tuff several hundred feet in thickness including rounded grains of quartz and particles of green matter like that of bed six parts pass into a very pale green semiporcellanic stone ninthly red or brown coarse conglomerate to feet thick formed chiefly of pebbles of porphyries with volcanic particles in an arenaceous noncalcareous fusible basis the upper two feet are arenaceous without any pebbles tenthly the last and uppermost stratum here exhibited is a compact slatecoloured porphyry with numerous elongated crystals of glassy feldspar from to feet in thickness it lies strictly conformably on the underlying conglomerate and is undoubtedly a submarine lava this great pile of strata has been broken up in several places by intrusive hillocks of purple claystone porphyry and by dikes of porphyritic greenstone it is said that a few poor metalliferous veins have been discovered here from the fusible nature and general appearance of the finergrained strata they probably owe their origin like the allied beds of the uspallata range and of the upper patagonian tertiary formations to gentle volcanic eruptions and to the abrasion of volcanic rocks comparing these beds with those in the mining district of arqueros we see at both places rocks easily fusible of the same peculiar bright green and red colours containing calcareous matter often having a finely brecciated structure often passing into each other and often alternating together hence i cannot doubt that the only difference between them lies in the arqueros beds having been more metamorphosed in conformity with their more dislocated and injected condition and consequently in the calcareous matter oxide of iron and green colouring matter having been segregated under a more crystalline form the strata are inclined as before stated from to eastward towards an irregular north and south chain of andesitic porphyry and of porphyritic greenstone where they are abruptly cut off in the valley of coquimbo near to the h of gualliguaca similar plutonic rocks are met with apparently a southern prolongation of the above chain and eastward of it we have an escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate with the strata inclined at a small angle eastward which makes the third escarpment including that nearest the coast proceeding up the valley we come to another north and south line of granite andesite and blackish porphyry which seem to lie in an irregular trough of the porphyritic conglomerate again on the south side of the r claro there are some irregular granitic hills which have thrown off the strata of porphyritic conglomerate to the nw by w but the stratification here has been much disturbed i did not proceed any farther up the valley and this point is about twothirds of the distance between the pacific and the main cordillera i will describe only one other section namely on the north side of the r claro which is interesting from containing fossils the strata are much dislocated by faults and dikes and are inclined to the north towards a mountain of andesite and porphyry into which they appear to become almost blended as the beds approach this mountain their inclination increases up to an angle of and in the upper part the rocks become highly metamorphosed the lowest bed visible in this section is a purplish hard sandstone secondly a bed or feet thick of a white siliceous sandstone with a calcareous cement containing seams of slaty sandstone and of hard yellowishbrown dolomitic limestone numerous wellrounded little pebbles of quartz are included in the sandstone thirdly a dark coloured limestone with some quartz pebbles from fifty to sixty feet in thickness containing numerous silicified shells presently to be enumerated fourthly very compact calcareous jaspery sandstone passing into fifthly a great bed several hundred feet thick of conglomerate composed of pebbles of white red and purple porphyries of sandstone and quartz cemented by calcareous matter i observed that some of the finer parts of this conglomerate were much indurated within a foot of a dike eight feet in width and were rendered of a paler colour with the calcareous matter segregated into white crystallised particles some parts were stained green from the colouring matter of the dike sixthly a thick mass obscurely stratified of a red sedimentary stone or sandstone full of crystalline calcareous matter imperfect crystals of oxide of iron and i believe of feldspar and therefore closely resembling some of the highly metamorphosed beds at arqueros this bed was capped by and appeared to pass in its upper part into rocks similarly coloured containing calcareous matter and abounding with minute crystals mostly elongated and glassy of reddish albite seventhly a conformable stratum of fine reddish porphyry with large crystals of albitic feldspar probably a submarine lava eighthly another conformable bed of green porphyry with specks of green earth and creamcoloured crystals of feldspar i believe that there are other superincumbent crystalline strata and submarine lavas but i had not time to examine them the upper beds in this section probably correspond with parts of the great gypseous formation and the lower beds of red sandstone conglomerate and fossiliferous limestone no doubt are the equivalents of the hippurite stratum seen in descending from arqueros to pluclaro which there lies conformably upon the porphyritic conglomerate formation the remarks given on the several foregoing shells show that in m dorbignys opinion the pecten ostrea turritella and hippurite indicate the cretaceous period and the gryphæa appears to prof forbes to be identical with a species associated in southern india with unquestionably cretaceous forms on the other hand the two terebratulæ and the spirifer point in the opinion both of m dorbigny and prof forbes to the oolitic series hence m dorbigny not having himself examined this country has concluded that there are here two distinct formations but the spirifer and t ænigma were certainly included in the same bed with the pecten and ostrea whence i extracted them and the geologist m domeyko sent home the two terebratulæ with the othernamed shells from the same locality without specifying that they came from different beds again as we shall presently see in a collection of shells given me from guasco the same species and others presenting analogous differences are mingled together and are in the same condition and lastly in three places in the valley of copiapo i found some of these same species similarly grouped hence there cannot be any doubt highly curious though the fact be that these several fossils namely the hippurites gryphæa ostrea pecten turritella nautilus two terebratulæ and spirifer all belong to the same formation which would appear to form a passage between the oolitic and cretaceous systems of europe although aware how unusual the term must sound i shall for convenience sake call this formation cretaceooolitic comparing the sections in this valley of coquimbo with those in the cordillera described in the last chapter and bearing in mind the character of the beds in the intermediate district of los hornos there is certainly a close general mineralogical resemblance between them both in the underlying porphyritic conglomerate and in the overlying gypseous formation considering this resemblance and that the fossils from the puente del inca at the base of the gypseous formation and throughout the greater part of its entire thickness on the peuquenes range indicate the neocomian periodthat is the dawn of the cretaceous system or as some have believed a passage between this latter and the oolitic seriesi conclude that probably the gypseous and associated beds in all the sections hitherto described belong to the same great formation which i have denominatedcretaceooolitic i may add before leaving coquimbo that m gay found in the neighbouring cordillera at the height of feet above the sea a fossiliferous formation including a trigonia and pholadomyaboth of which genera occur at the puente del inca coquimbo to guascothe rocks near the coast and some way inland do not differ from those described northwards of valparaiso we have much greenstone syenite feldspathic and jaspery slate and grauwackes having a basis like that of claystone there are some large tracts of granite in which the constituent minerals are sometimes arranged in folia thus composing an imperfect gneiss there are two large districts of micaschist passing into glossy clayslate and resembling the great formation in the chonos archipelago in the valley of guasco an escarpment of porphyritic conglomerate is first seen high up the valley about two leagues eastward of the town of ballenar i heard of a great gypseous formation in the cordillera and a collection of shells made there was given me valley of copiapothe journey from guasco to copiapo owing to the utterly desert nature of the country was necessarily so hurried that i do not consider my notes worth giving in the valley of copiapo some of the sections are very interesting from the sea to the town of copiapo a distance estimated at thirty miles the mountains are composed of greenstone granite andesite and blackish porphyry together with some duskygreen feldspathic rocks which i believe to be altered clayslate these mountains are crossed by many browncoloured dikes running north and south above the town the main valley runs in a southeast and even more southerly course towards the cordillera where it is divided into three great ravines by the northern one of which call jolquera i penetrated for a short distance the coloured section fig in plate i gives an eyesketch of the structure and composition of the mountains on both sides of this valley a straight east and west line from the town to the cordillera is perhaps not more than thirty miles but along the valley the distance is much greater wherever the valley trended very southerly i have endeavoured to contract the section into its true proportion this valley i may add rises much more gently than any other valley which i saw in chile to commence with our section for a short distance above the town we have hills of the granitic series together with some of that rock a which i suspect to be altered clayslate but which prof g rose judging from specimens collected by meyen at p negro states is serpentine passing into greenstone we then come suddenly to the great gypseous formation b without having passed over differently from in all the sections hitherto described any of the porphyritic conglomerate the strata are at first either horizontal or gently inclined westward then highly inclined in various directions and contorted by underlying masses of intrusive rocks and lastly they have a regular eastward dip and form a tolerably well pronounced north and south line of hills this formation consists of thin strata with innumerable alternations of black calcareous slaterock of calcareoaluminous stones like those at coquimbo which i have called pseudohonestones of green jaspery layers and of palepurplish calcareous soft rottenstone including seams and veins of gypsum these strata are conformably overlaid by a great thickness of thinly stratified compact limestone with included crystals of carbonate of lime at a place called tierra amarilla at the foot of a mountain thus composed there is a broad vein or perhaps stratum of a beautiful and curious crystallised mixture composed according to prof g rose of sulphate of iron under two forms and of the sulphates of copper and alumina the section is so obscure that i could not make out whether this vein or stratum occurred in the gypseous formation or more probably in some underlying masses a which i believe are altered clayslate second axis of elevationafter the gypseous masses b we come to a line of hills of unstratified porphyry c which on their eastern side blend into strata of great thickness of porphyritic conglomerate dipping eastward this latter formation however here has not been nearly so much
