all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains during these long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction and that there was much migration from other parts of the world as we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements when two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly but not exactly the same period we should find in both from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs the same general succession in the forms of life but the species would not exactly correspond for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification extinction and immigration i suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in europe mr prestwich in his admirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of england and france is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries but when he compares certain stages in england with those in france although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the two areasunless indeed it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct but contemporaneous faunas lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations barrande also shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive silurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species if the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periodsa formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the otherand if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order in accordance with the general succession of the form of life and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living formslet us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species they all fall into one grand natural system and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent the more ancient any form is the more as a general rule it differs from living forms but as buckland long ago remarked all fossils can be classed either in still existing groups or between them that the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera families and orders cannot be disputed for if we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct alone the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system with respect to the vertebrata whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palæontologist owen showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups cuvier ranked the ruminants and pachyderms as the two most distinct orders of mammals but owen has discovered so many fossil links that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two orders and has placed certain pachyderms in the same suborder with ruminants for example he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently wide difference between the pig and the camel in regard to the invertebrata barrande and a higher authority could not be named asserts that he is every day taught that palæozoic animals though belonging to the same orders families or genera with those living at the present day were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being considered as intermediate between living species or groups if by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms the objection is probably valid but i apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species and some extinct genera between living genera even between genera belonging to distinct families the most common case especially with respect to very distinct groups such as fish and reptiles seems to be that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters so that the two groups though formerly quite distinct at that period made some small approach to each other it is a common belief that the more ancient a form is by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated from each other this remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition for every now and then even a living animal as the lepidosiren is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups yet if we compare the older reptiles and batrachians the older fish the older cephalopods and the eocene mammals with the more recent members of the same classes we must admit that there is some truth in the remark let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification as the subject is somewhat complex i must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter we may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus the diagram is much too simple too few genera and too few species being given but this is unimportant for us the horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct the three existing genera a q p will form a small family b and f a closely allied family or subfamily and o e m a third family these three families together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parentform a will form an order for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common progenitor on the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character which was formerly illustrated by this diagram the more recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms we must not however assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature therefore it is quite possible as we have seen in the case of some silurian forms that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics this is represented in the diagram by the letter f all the many forms extinct and recent descended from a make as before remarked one order and this order from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character has become divided into several subfamilies and families some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods and some to have endured to the present day by looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations were discovered at several points low down in the series the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other if for instance the genera a a a f m m m were disinterred these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms yet he who objected to call the extinct genera which thus linked the living genera of three families together intermediate in character would be justified as they are intermediate not directly but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms if many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formationsfor instance above no vibut none from beneath this line then only the two families on the left hand namely a c and b c would have to be united into one family and the two other families namely a to f now including five genera and o to m would yet remain distinct these two families however would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils if for instance we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen characters in this case the genera at the early period marked vi would differ by a lesser number of characters for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common progenitor of the order nearly so much as they subsequently diverged thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants or between their collateral relations in nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram for the groups will have been more numerous they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time and will have been modified in various degrees as we possess only the last volume of the geological record and that in a very broken condition we have no right to expect except in very rare cases to fill up wide intervals in the natural system and thus unite distinct families or orders all that we have a right to expect is that those groups which have within known geological periods undergone much modification should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palæontologists seems frequently to be the case thus on the theory of descent with modification the main facts with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner and they are wholly inexplicable on any other view on this same theory it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earths history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below we must however allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms and for the coming in of quite new forms by immigration and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations subject to these allowances the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas i need give only one instance namely the manner in which the fossils of the devonian system when this system was first discovered were at once recognised by palæontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying silurian system but each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations it is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule for instance mastodons and elephants when arranged by dr falconer in two series first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence do not accord in arrangement the species extreme in character are not the oldest or the most recent nor are those which are intermediate in character intermediate in age but supposing for an instant in this and other such cases that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts to compare small things with great if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production and still less with the order of their disappearance for the parent rockpigeon now lives and many varieties between the rockpigeon and the carrier have become extinct and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than shortbeaked tumblers which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect closely connected with the statement that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character is the fact insisted on by all palæontologists that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other than are the fossils from two remote formations pictet gives as a wellknown instance the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation though the species are distinct in each stage this fact alone from its generality seems to have shaken professor pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of species he who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely consecutive formations by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same let it be remembered that the forms of life at least those inhabiting the sea have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world and therefore under the most different climates and conditions consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period which includes the whole glacial period and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected on the theory of descent the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations though ranked as distinct species being closely related is obvious as the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations we ought not to expect to find as i attempted to show in the last chapter in any one or two formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods but we ought to find after intervals very long as measured by years but only moderately long as measured geologically closely allied forms or as they have been called by some authors representative species and these we assuredly do find we find in short such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms as we have a just right to expect to find on the state of development of ancient formsthere has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient i will not here enter on this subject for naturalists have not as yet defined to each others satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms but in one particular sense the more recent forms must on my theory be higher than the more ancient for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and preceding forms if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated as would a secondary fauna by an eocene and a palæozoic fauna by a secondary fauna i do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms but i can see no way of testing this sort of progress crustaceans for instance not the highest in their own class may have beaten the highest molluscs from the extraordinary manner in which european productions have recently spread over new zealand and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied we may believe if all the animals and plants of great britain were set free in new zealand that in the course of time a multitude of british forms would become thoroughly naturalized there and would exterminate many of the natives on the other hand from what we see now occurring in new zealand and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become wild in any part of europe we may doubt if all the productions of new zealand were set free in great britain whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals under this point of view the productions of great britain may be said to be higher than those of new zealand yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms i must follow pictet and huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved yet i fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed at least in regard to subordinate groups which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times for this doctrine of agassiz accords well with the theory of natural selection in a future chapter i shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo owing to variations supervening at a not early age and being inherited at a corresponding age this process whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered continually adds in the course of successive generations more and more difference to the adult thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture preserved by nature of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal this view may be true and yet it may never be capable of full proof seeing for instance that the oldest known mammals reptiles and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the vertebrata until beds far beneath the lowest silurian strata are discovereda discovery of which the chance is very small on the succession of the same types within the same areas during the later tertiary periodsmr clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent in south america a similar relationship is manifest even to an uneducated eye in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo found in several parts of la plata and professor owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals buried there in such numbers are related to south american types this relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil i was so much impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted in and on this law of the succession of typeson this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living professor owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the old world we see the same law in this authors restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of new zealand we see it also in the birds of the caves of brazil mr woodward has shown that the same law holds good with seashells but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs it is not well displayed by them other cases could be added as the relation between the extinct and living landshells of madeira and between the extinct and living brackishwater shells of the aralocaspian sea now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas mean he would be a bold man who after comparing the present climate of australia and of parts of south america under the same latitude would attempt to account on the one hand by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents and on the other hand by similarity of conditions for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in australia or that edentata and other american types should have been solely produced in south america for we know that europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials and i have shown in the publications above alluded to that in america the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is north america formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent and the southern half was formerly more closely allied than it is at present to the northern half in a similar manner we know from falconer and cautleys discoveries that northern india was formerly more closely related in its mammals to africa than it is at the present time analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals on the theory of descent with modification the great law of the long enduring but not immutable succession of the same types within the same areas is at once explained for the inhabitants of each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter during the next succeeding period of time closely allied though in some degree modified descendants if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree but after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes permitting much intermigration the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present distribution it may be asked in ridicule whether i suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america the sloth armadillo and anteater as their degenerate descendants this cannot for an instant be admitted these huge animals have become wholly extinct and have left no progeny but in the caves of brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in south america and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species it must not be forgotten that on my theory all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species so that if six genera each having eight species be found in one geological formation and in the next succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of species then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants constituting the six new genera the other seven species of the old genera have all died out and have left no progeny or which would probably be a far commoner case two or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new genera the other old species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct in failing orders with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as apparently is the case of the edentata of south america still fewer genera and species will have left modified blooddescendants summary of the preceding and present chaptersi have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state that the number both of specimens and of species preserved in our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation that owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence and more variation during the periods of elevation and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept that each single formation has not been continuously deposited that the duration of each formation is perhaps short compared with the average duration of specific forms that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation that widely ranging species are those which have varied most and have oftenest given rise to new species and that varieties have at first often been local all these causes taken conjointly must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record will rightly reject my whole theory for he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species found in the several stages of the same great formation he may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations he may overlook how important a part migration must have played when the formations of any one great region alone as that of europe are considered he may urge the apparent but often falsely apparent sudden coming in of whole groups of species he may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited i can answer this latter question only hypothetically by saying that as far as we can see where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the silurian epoch but that long before that period the world may have presented a wholly different aspect and that the older continents formed of formations older than any known to us may now all be in a metamorphosed condition or may lie buried under the ocean passing from these difficulties all the other great leading facts in palæontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection we can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively how species of different classes do not necessarily change together or at the same rate or in the same degree yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent the extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms we can understand why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears groups of species increase in numbers slowly and endure for unequal periods of time for the process of modification is necessarily slow and depends on many complex contingencies the dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants and thus new subgroups and groups are formed as these are formed the species of the less vigorous groups from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor tend to become extinct together and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth but the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process from the survival of a few descendants lingering in protected and isolated situations when a group has once wholly disappeared it does not reappear for the link of generation has been broken we can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life which are those that oftenest vary will in the long run tend to people the world with allied but modified descendants and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence hence after long intervals of time the productions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously we can understand how it is that all the forms of life ancient and recent make together one grand system for all are connected by generation we can understand from the continued tendency to divergence of character why the more ancient a form is the more it generally differs from those now living why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one but more commonly only bringing them a little closer together the more ancient a form is the more often apparently it displays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct for the more ancient a form is the more nearly it will be related to and consequently resemble the common progenitor of groups since become widely divergent extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms we can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other than are those of remote formations for the forms are more closely linked together by generation we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character the inhabitants of each successive period in the worlds history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life and are in so far higher in the scale of nature and this may account for that vague yet illdefined sentiment felt by many palæontologists that organisation on the whole has progressed if it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class the fact will be intelligible the succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious and is simply explained by inheritance if then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear on the other hand all the chief laws of palæontology plainly proclaim as it seems to me that species have been produced by ordinary generation old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life produced by the laws of variation still acting round us and preserved by natural selection chapter xi geographical distribution present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions importance of barriers affinity of the productions of the same continent centres of creation means of dispersal by changes of climate and of the level of the land and by occasional means dispersal during the glacial period coextensive with the world in considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe the first great fact which strikes us is that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions of late almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove its truth for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and old worlds yet if we travel over the vast american continent from the central parts of the united states to its extreme southern point we meet with the most diversified conditions the most humid districts arid deserts lofty mountains grassy plains forests marshes lakes and great rivers under almost every temperature there is hardly a climate or condition in the old world which cannot be paralleled in the newat least as closely as the same species generally require for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small spot having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree for instance small areas in the old world could be pointed out hotter than any in the new world yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the old and new worlds how widely different are their living productions in the southern hemisphere if we compare large tracts of land in australia south africa and western south america between latitudes º and º we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar or again we may compare the productions of south america south of lat º with those north of º which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate and they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other than they are to the productions of australia or africa under nearly the same climate analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea a second great fact which strikes us in our general review is that barriers of any kind or obstacles to free migration are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions we see this in the great difference of nearly all the terrestrial productions of the new and old worlds excepting in the northern parts where the land almost joins and where under a slightly different climate there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms as there now is for the strictly arctic productions we see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of australia africa and south america under the same latitude for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible on each continent also we see the same fact for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountainranges and of great deserts and sometimes even of large rivers we find different productions though as mountainchains deserts c are not as impassable or likely to have endured so long as the oceans separating continents the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents turning to the sea we find the same law no two marine faunas are more distinct with hardly a fish shell or crab in common than those of the eastern and western shores of south and central america yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow but impassable isthmus of panama westward of the shores of america a wide space of open ocean extends with not an island as a haltingplace for emigrants here we have a barrier of another kind and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the pacific with another and totally distinct fauna so that here three marine faunas range far northward and southward in parallel lines not far from each other under corresponding climates but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers either of land or open sea they are wholly distinct on the other hand proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific we encounter no impassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as haltingplaces until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of africa and over this vast space we meet with no welldefined and distinct marine faunas although hardly one shell crab or fish is common to the abovenamed three approximate faunas of eastern and western america and the eastern pacific islands yet many fish range from the pacific into the indian ocean and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the pacific and the eastern shores of africa on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude a third great fact partly included in the foregoing statements is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations it is a law of the widest generality and every continent offers innumerable instances nevertheless the naturalist in travelling for instance from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings specifically distinct yet clearly related replace each other he hears from closely allied yet distinct kinds of birds notes nearly similar and sees their nests similarly constructed but not quite alike with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner the plains near the straits of magellan are inhabited by one species of rhea american ostrich and northward the plains of la plata by another species of the same genus and not by a true ostrich or emeu like those found in africa and australia under the same latitude on these same plains of la plata we see the agouti and bizcacha animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of rodents but they plainly display an american type of structure we ascend the lofty peaks of the cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha we look to the waters and we do not find the beaver or muskrat but the coypu and capybara rodents of the american type innumerable other instances could be given if we look to the islands off the american shore however much they may differ in geological structure the inhabitants though they may be all peculiar species are essentially american we may look back to past ages as shown in the last chapter and we find american types then prevalent on the american continent and in the american seas we see in these facts some deep organic bond prevailing throughout space and time over the same areas of land and water and independent of their physical conditions the naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not led to inquire what this bond is this bond on my theory is simply inheritance that cause which alone as far as we positively know produces organisms quite like or as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through natural selection and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions the degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected with more or less ease at periods more or less remoteon the nature and number of the former immigrantsand on their action and reaction in their mutual struggles for lifethe relation of organism to organism being as i have already often remarked the most important of all relations thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection widelyranging species abounding in individuals which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widelyextended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new places when they spread into new countries in their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement and thus they will become still further victorious and will produce groups of modified descendants on this principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that sections of genera whole genera and even families are confined to the same areas as is so commonly and notoriously the case i believe as was remarked in the last chapter in no law of necessary development as the variability of each species is an independent property and will be taken advantage of by natural selection only so far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity if for instance a number of species which stand in direct competition with each other migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country they will be little liable to modification for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything these principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions as we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period so certain species have migrated over vast spaces and have not become greatly modified on these views it is obvious that the several species of the same genus though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world must originally have proceeded from the same source as they have descended from the same progenitor in the case of those species which have undergone during whole geological periods but little modification there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times almost any amount of migration is possible but in many other cases in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times there is great difficulty on this head it is also obvious that the individuals of the same species though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions must have proceeded from one spot where their parents were first produced for as explained in the last chapter it is incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have been produced through natural selection from parents specifically distinct we are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists namely whether species have been created at one or more points of the earths surface undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points where now found nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind he who rejects it rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration and calls in the agency of a miracle it is universally admitted that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other or with an interval of such a nature that the space could not be easily passed over by migration the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional the capacity of migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals than perhaps in any other organic beings and accordingly we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world no geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as great britain having been formerly united to europe and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds but if the same species can be produced at two separate points why do we not find a single mammal common to europe and australia or south america the conditions of life are nearly the same so that a multitude of european animals and plants have become naturalised in america and australia and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres the answer as i believe is that mammals have not been able to migrate whereas some plants from their varied means of dispersal have migrated across the vast and broken interspace the great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on distribution is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side alone and have not been able to migrate to the other side some few families many subfamilies very many genera and a still greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region and it has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other are generally local or confined to one area what a strange anomaly it would be if when coming one step lower in the series to the individuals of the same species a directly opposite rule prevailed and species were not local but had been produced in two or more distinct areas hence it seems to me as it has to many other naturalists that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted is the most probable undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other but the geographical and climatal changes which have certainly occurred within recent geological times must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species so that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature that we ought to give up the belief rendered probable by general considerations that each species has been produced within one area and has migrated thence as far as it could it would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species now living at distant and separated points nor do i for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases but after some preliminary remarks i will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts namely the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountainranges and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic regions and secondly in the following chapter the wide distribution of freshwater productions and thirdly the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea if the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earths surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace then considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport the belief that this has been the universal law seems to me incomparably the safest in discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us namely whether the several distinct species of a genus which on my theory have all descended from a common progenitor can have migrated undergoing modification during some part of their migration from the area inhabited by their progenitor if it can be shown to be almost invariably the case that a region of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region my theory will be strengthened for we can clearly understand on the principle of modification why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region whence it has been stocked a volcanic island for instance upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists and their descendants though modified would still be plainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent cases of this nature are common and are as we shall hereafter more fully see inexplicable on the theory of independent creation this view of the relation of species in one region to those in another does not differ much by substituting the word variety for species from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by mr wallace in which he concludes that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a preexisting closely allied species and i now know from correspondence that this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification the previous remarks on single and multiple centres of creation do not directly bear on another allied questionnamely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair or single hermaphrodite or whether as some authors suppose from many individuals simultaneously created with those organic beings which never intercross if such exist the species on my theory must have descended from a succession of improved varieties which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties but will have supplanted each other so that at each successive stage of modification and improvement all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent but in the majority of cases namely with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth or which often intercross i believe that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing and the whole amount of modification will not have been due at each stage to descent from a single parent to illustrate what i mean our english racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations before discussing the three classes of facts which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of single centres of creation i must say a few words on the means of dispersal means of dispersalsir c lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject i can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration but now be impassable i shall however presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas submerge it or let it formerly have been submerged and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended where the sea now extends land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other no geologist will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms edward forbes insisted that all the islands in the atlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa and europe likewise with america other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean and have united almost every island to some mainland if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent this view cuts the gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points and removes many a difficulty but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species it seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents but not of such vast changes in their position and extension as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands i freely admit the former existence of many islands now buried beneath the sea which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration in the coralproducing oceans such sunken islands are now marked as i believe by rings of coral or atolls standing over them whenever it is fully admitted as i believe it will some day be that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate have been continuously or almost continuously united with each other and with the many existing oceanic islands several facts in distributionsuch as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continentthe close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitantsa certain degree of relation as we shall hereafter see between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the seathese and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period as are necessitated on the view advanced by forbes and admitted by his many followers the nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continentsif they had originally existed as mountainranges on the land some at least of the islands would have been formed like other mountainsummits of granite metamorphic schists old fossiliferous or other such rocks instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter i must now say a few words on what are called accidental means but which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution i shall here confine myself to plants in botanical works this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination but for transport across the sea the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown until i tried with mr berkeleys aid a few experiments it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of seawater to my surprise i found that out of kinds germinated after an immersion of days and a few survived an immersion of days for convenience sake i chiefly tried small seeds without the capsule or fruit and as all of these sank in a few days they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea whether or not they were injured by the saltwater afterwards i tried some larger fruits capsules c and some of these floated for a long time it is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches and that these might be dried on the banks and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea hence i was led to dry stems and branches of plants with ripe fruit and to place them on sea water the majority sank quickly but some which whilst green floated for a very short time when dried floated much longer for instance ripe hazelnuts sank immediately but when dried they floated for days and afterwards when planted they germinated an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for days when dried it floated for days and the seeds afterwards germinated the ripe seeds of helosciadium sank in two days when dried they floated for above days and afterwards germinated altogether out of the dried plants floated for above days and some of the floated for a very much longer period so that as seeds germinated after an immersion of days and as plants with ripe fruit but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment floated after being dried for above days as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts we may conclude that the seeds of plants of any country might be floated by seacurrents during days and would retain their power of germination in johnstons physical atlas the average rate of the several atlantic currents is miles per diem some currents running at the rate of miles per diem on this average the seeds of plants belonging to one country might be floated across miles of sea to another country and when stranded if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale they would germinate subsequently to my experiments m martens tried similar ones but in a much better manner for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants he tried seeds mostly different from mine but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the saltwater on the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit and this as we have seen would have caused some of them to have floated much longer the
