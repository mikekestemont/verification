several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palæozoic beds of north america than in those of europe time having apparently been required for their migration from the american to the european seas in examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world it has everywhere been noted that some few still existing species are common in the deposit but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea or conversely that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea but are rare or absent in this particular deposit it is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of europe during the glacial period which forms only a part of one whole geological period and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level on the inordinately great change of climate on the prodigious lapse of time all included within this same glacial period yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world sedimentary deposits including fossil remains have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period it is not for instance probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the mississippi within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of america during this space of time when such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes and in the distant future a geologist examining these beds might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period instead of having been really far greater that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day in order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time but we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence and to keep the depth approximately the same which is necessary in order to enable the same species to live on the same space the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence but this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues in fact this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one palæontologist that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains except near their upper or lower limits it would seem that each separate formation like the whole pile of formations in any country has generally been intermittent in its accumulation when we see as is so often the case a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness representing formations elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised denuded submerged and then recovered by the upper beds of the same formationfacts showing what wide yet easily overlooked intervals have occurred in its accumulation in other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees still standing upright as they grew of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition which would never even have been suspected had not the trees chanced to have been preserved thus messrs lyell and dawson found carboniferous beds feet thick in nova scotia with ancient rootbearing strata one above the other at no less than sixtyeight different levels hence when the same species occur at the bottom middle and top of a formation the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition but have disappeared and reappeared perhaps many times during the same geological period so that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them but abrupt though perhaps very slight changes of form it is allimportant to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties they grant some little variability to each species but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms they rank both as species unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section supposing b and c to be two species and a third a to be found in an underlying bed even if a were strictly intermediate between b and c it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties nor should it be forgotten as before explained that a might be the actual progenitor of b and c and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure so that we might obtain the parentspecies and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations we should not recognise their relationship and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species it is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palæontologists have founded their species and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different substages of the same formation some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of dorbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find moreover if we look to rather wider intervals namely to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation we find that the embedded fossils though almost universally ranked as specifically different yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations but to this subject i shall have to return in the following chapter one other consideration is worth notice with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive there is reason to suspect as we have formerly seen that their varieties are generally at first local and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parentforms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree according to this view the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms is small for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot most marine animals have a wide range and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and other marine animals it is probably those which have had the widest range far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of europe which have oftenest given rise first to local varieties and ultimately to new species and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation it should not be forgotten that at the present day with perfect specimens for examination two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species until many specimens have been collected from many places and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palæontologists we shall perhaps best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous fine intermediate fossil links by asking ourselves whether for instance geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle sheep horses and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks or again whether certain seashells inhabiting the shores of north america which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their european representatives and by other conchologists as only varieties are really varieties or are as it is called specifically distinct this could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree geological research though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera and has made the intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species by connecting them together by numerous fine intermediate varieties and this not having been effected is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks under an imaginary illustration the malay archipelago is of about the size of europe from the north cape to the mediterranean and from britain to russia and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy excepting those of the united states of america i fully agree with mr godwinausten that the present condition of the malay archipelago with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas probably represents the former state of europe when most of our formations were accumulating the malay archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world but we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating i suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks would be embedded and those embedded in gravel or sand would not endure to a distant epoch wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay no remains could be preserved in our archipelago i believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past only during periods of subsidence these periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals during which the area would be either stationary or rising whilst rising each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed almost as soon as accumulated by the incessant coastaction as we now see on the shores of south america during the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of elevation there would be much variation but the geological record would then be least perfect it may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species if such gradations were not fully preserved transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species it is also probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these farranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place but if possessed of any decided advantage or when further modified and improved they would slowly spread and supplant their parentforms when such varieties returned to their ancient homes as they would differ from their former state in a nearly uniform though perhaps extremely slight degree they would according to the principles followed by many palæontologists be ranked as new and distinct species if then there be some degree of truth in these remarks we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations an infinite number of those fine transitional forms which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life we ought only to look for a few links some more closely some more distantly related to each other and these links let them be ever so close if found in different stages of the same formation would by most palæontologists be ranked as distinct species but i do not pretend that i should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life the best preserved geological section presented had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation pressed so hardly on my theory on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied speciesthe abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations has been urged by several palæontologists for instance by agassiz pictet and by none more forcibly than by professor sedgwick as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species if numerous species belonging to the same genera or families have really started into life all at once the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection for the development of a group of forms all of which have descended from some one progenitor must have been an extremely slow process and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants but we continually overrate the perfection of the geological record and falsely infer because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage that they did not exist before that stage we continually forget how large the world is compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of europe and of the united states we do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formationslonger perhaps in some cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parentforms and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created i may here recall a remark formerly made namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life for instance to fly through the air but that when this had been effected and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world i will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced i may recall the wellknown fact that in geological treatises published not many years ago the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series and now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct species have been discovered in india south america and in europe even as far back as the eocene stage the most striking case however is that of the whale family as these animals have huge bones are marine and range over the world the fact of not a single bone of a whale having been discovered in any secondary formation seemed fully to justify the belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary formation but now we may read in the supplement to lyells manual published in clear evidence of the existence of whales in the upper greensand some time before the close of the secondary period i may give another instance which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes i have stated that from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world from the arctic regions to the equator inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to fathoms from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised from all these circumstances i inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods they would certainly have been preserved and discovered and as not one species had been discovered in beds of this age i concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series this was a sore trouble to me adding as i thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species but my work had hardly been published when a skilful palæontologist m bosquet sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede which he had himself extracted from the chalk of belgium and as if to make the case as striking as possible this sessile cirripede was a chthamalus a very common large and ubiquitous genus of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species the case most frequently insisted on by palæontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species is that of the teleostean fishes low down in the chalk period this group includes the large majority of existing species lately professor pictet has carried their existence one substage further back and some palæontologists believe that certain much older fishes of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known are really teleostean assuming however that the whole of them did appear as agassiz believes at the commencement of the chalk formation the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but i cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period it is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossilfish are known from south of the equator and by running through pictets palæontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in europe some few families of fish now have a confined range the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range and after having been largely developed in some one sea might have spread widely nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present even at this day if the malay archipelago were converted into land the tropical parts of the indian ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied and here they would remain confined until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate and were enabled to double the southern capes of africa or australia and thus reach other and distant seas from these and similar considerations but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and the united states and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in australia and then to discuss the number and range of its productions on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known fossiliferous stratathere is another and allied difficulty which is much graver i allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species for instance i cannot doubt that all the silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean which must have lived long before the silurian age and which probably differed greatly from any known animal some of the most ancient silurian animals as the nautilus lingula c do not differ much from living species and it cannot on my theory be supposed that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them if moreover they had been the progenitors of these orders they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants consequently if my theory be true it is indisputable that before the lowest silurian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or probably far longer than the whole interval from the silurian age to the present day and that during these vast yet quite unknown periods of time the world swarmed with living creatures to the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods i can give no satisfactory answer several of the most eminent geologists with sir r murchison at their head are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet other highly competent judges as lyell and the late e forbes dispute this conclusion we should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy m barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the silurian system abounding with new and peculiar species traces of life have been detected in the longmynd beds beneath barrandes socalled primordial zone the presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods but the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the silurian epoch is very great if these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation or obliterated by metamorphic action we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition but the descriptions which we now possess of the silurian deposits over immense territories in russia and in north america do not support the view that the older a formation is the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained to show that it may hereafter receive some explanation i will give the following hypothesis from the nature of the organic remains which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths in the several formations of europe and of the united states and from the amount of sediment miles in thickness of which the formations are composed we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land whence the sediment was derived occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of europe and north america but we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations whether europe and the united states during these intervals existed as dry land or as a submarine surface near land on which sediment was not deposited or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea looking to the existing oceans which are thrice as extensive as the land we see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palæozoic or secondary formation hence we may perhaps infer that during the palæozoic and secondary periods neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend for had they existed there palæozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods if then we may infer anything from these facts we may infer that where our oceans now extend oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record and on the other hand that where continents now exist large tracts of land have existed subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level since the earliest silurian period the coloured map appended to my volume on coral reefs led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level and the continents areas of elevation but have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance during many oscillations of level of the force of elevation but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages at a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand nor should we be justified in assuming that if for instance the bed of the pacific ocean were now converted into a continent we should there find formations older than the silurian strata supposing such to have been formerly deposited for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface the immense areas in some parts of the world for instance in south america of bare metamorphic rocks which must have been heated under great pressure have always seemed to me to require some special explanation and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition the several difficulties here discussed namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our european formations the almost entire absence as at present known of fossiliferous formations beneath the silurian strata are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature we see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palæontologists namely cuvier owen agassiz barrande falconer e forbes c and all our greatest geologists as lyell murchison sedgwick c have unanimously often vehemently maintained the immutability of species but i have reason to believe that one great authority sir charles lyell from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject i feel how rash it is to differ from these great authorities to whom with others we owe all our knowledge those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume will undoubtedly at once reject my theory for my part following out lyells metaphor i look at the natural geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last volume alone relating only to two or three countries of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page only here and there a few lines each word of the slowlychanging language in which the history is supposed to be written being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life entombed in our consecutive but widely separated formations on this view the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished or even disappear chapter x on the geological succession of organic beings on the slow and successive appearance of new species on their different rates of change species once lost do not reappear groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species on extinction on simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species on the state of development of ancient forms on the succession of the same types within the same areas summary of preceding and present chapters let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic beings better accord with the common view of the immutability of species or with that of their slow and gradual modification through descent and natural selection new species have appeared very slowly one after another both on the land and in the waters lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual in some of the most recent beds though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years only one or two species are lost forms and only one or two are new forms having here appeared for the first time either locally or as far as we know on the face of the earth if we may trust the observations of philippi in sicily the successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual the secondary formations are more broken but as bronn has remarked neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate or in the same degree in the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the subhimalayan deposits the silurian lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus whereas most of the other silurian molluscs and all the crustaceans have changed greatly the productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea of which a striking instance has lately been observed in switzerland there is some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the scale of nature change more quickly than those that are low though there are exceptions to this rule the amount of organic change as pictet has remarked does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations so that between each two consecutive formations the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations all the species will be found to have undergone some change when a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears the strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of the socalled colonies of m barrande which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation and then allow the preexisting fauna to reappear but lyells explanation namely that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province seems to me satisfactory these several facts accord well with my theory i believe in no fixed law of development causing all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly or simultaneously or to an equal degree the process of modification must be extremely slow the variability of each species is quite independent of that of all others whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural selection and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount thus causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species depends on many complex contingencieson the variability being of a beneficial nature on the power of intercrossing on the rate of breeding on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country and more especially on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others or if changing that it should change less we see the same fact in geographical distribution for instance in the landshells and coleopterous insects of madeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of europe whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered we can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life as explained in a former chapter when many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved we can understand on the principle of competition and on that of the many allimportant relations of organism to organism that any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved will be liable to be exterminated hence we can see why all the species in the same region do at last if we look to wide enough intervals of time become modified for those which do not change will become extinct in members of the same class the average amount of change during long and equal periods of time may perhaps be nearly the same but as the accumulation of longenduring fossiliferous formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal each formation on this view does not mark a new and complete act of creation but only an occasional scene taken almost at hazard in a slowly changing drama we can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear even if the very same conditions of life organic and inorganic should recur for though the offspring of one species might be adapted and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature and thus supplant it yet the two formsthe old and the newwould not be identically the same for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors for instance it is just possible if our fantailpigeons were all destroyed that fanciers by striving during long ages for the same object might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail but if the parent rockpigeon were also destroyed and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parentform will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring it is quite incredible that a fantail identical with the existing breed could be raised from any other species of pigeon or even from the other wellestablished races of the domestic pigeon for the newlyformed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences groups of species that is genera and families follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species changing more or less quickly and in a greater or lesser degree a group does not reappear after it has once disappeared or its existence as long as it lasts is continuous i am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule but the exceptions are surprisingly few so few that e forbes pictet and woodward though all strongly opposed to such views as i maintain admit its truth and the rule strictly accords with my theory for as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages so long must its members have continuously existed in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms species of the genus lingula for instance must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations from the lowest silurian stratum to the present day we have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes falsely appear to have come in abruptly and i have attempted to give an explanation of this fact which if true would have been fatal to my views but such cases are certainly exceptional the general rule being a gradual increase in number till the group reaches its maximum and then sooner or later it gradually decreases if the number of the species of a genus or the number of the genera of a family be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end not in a sharp point but abruptly it then gradually thickens upwards sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness and ultimately thins out in the upper beds marking the decrease and final extinction of the species this gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory as the species of the same genus and the genera of the same family can increase only slowly and progressively for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradualone species giving rise first to two or three varieties these being slowly converted into species which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species and so on like the branching of a great tree from a single stem till the group becomes large on extinctionwe have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species on the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together the old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes is very generally given up even by those geologists as elie de beaumont murchison barrande c whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion on the contrary we have every reason to believe from the study of the tertiary formations that species and groups of species gradually disappear one after another first from one spot then from another and finally from the world both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods some groups as we have seen having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day some having disappeared before the close of the palæozoic period no fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures there is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented as before by a vertical line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end which marks the progress of extermination than at its lower end which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species in some cases however the extermination of whole groups of beings as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period has been wonderfully sudden the whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery some authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life so have species a definite duration no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species than i have done when i found in la plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of mastodon megatherium toxodon and other extinct monsters which all coexisted with still living shells at a very late geological period i was filled with astonishment for seeing that the horse since its introduction by the spaniards into south america has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate i asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable but how utterly groundless was my astonishment professor owen soon perceived that the tooth though so like that of the existing horse belonged to an extinct species had this horse been still living but in some degree rare no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes in all countries if we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life but what that something is we can hardly ever tell on the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals even of the slowbreeding elephant and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in south america that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent but we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase whether some one or several contingencies and at what period of the horses life and in what degree they severally acted if the conditions had gone on however slowly becoming less and less favourable we assuredly should not have perceived the fact yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer and finally extinctits place being seized on by some more successful competitor it is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity and finally extinction we see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity precedes extinction and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated either locally or wholly through mans agency i may repeat what i published in namely that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinctto feel no surprise at the rarity of a species and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of deathto feel no surprise at sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence the theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety and ultimately each new species is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition and the consequent extinction of lessfavoured forms almost inevitably follows it is the same with our domestic productions when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood when much improved it is transported far and near like our shorthorn cattle and takes the place of other breeds in other countries thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms both natural and artificial are bound together in certain flourishing groups the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing at least during the later geological periods so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms the competition will generally be most severe as formerly explained and illustrated by examples between the forms which are most like each other in all respects hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parentspecies and if many new forms have been developed from any one species the nearest allies of that species ie the species of the same genus will be the most liable to extermination thus as i believe a number of new species descended from one species that is a new genus comes to supplant an old genus belonging to the same family but it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group and thus caused its extermination and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder many will have to yield their places and it will generally be allied forms which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common but whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class which yield their places to other species which have been modified and improved a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved from being fitted to some peculiar line of life or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station where they have escaped severe competition for instance a single species of trigonia a great genus of shells in the secondary formations survives in the australian seas and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally as we have seen a slower process than its production with respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders as of trilobites at the close of the palæozoic period and of ammonites at the close of the secondary period we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination moreover when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied for they will partake of some inferiority in common thus as it seems to me the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural selection we need not marvel at extinction if we must marvel let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends if we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase inordinately and that some check is always in action yet seldom perceived by us the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country then and not till then we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout the worldscarcely any palæontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world under the most different climates where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found namely in north america in equatorial south america in tierra del fuego at the cape of good hope and in the peninsula of india for at these distant points the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the chalk it is not that the same species are met with for in some cases not one species is identically the same but they belong to the same families genera and sections of genera and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture moreover other forms which are not found in the chalk of europe but which occur in the formations either above or below are similarly absent at these distant points of the world in the several successive palæozoic formations of russia western europe and north america a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors so it is according to lyell with the several european and north american tertiary deposits even if the few fossil species which are common to the old and new worlds be kept wholly out of view the general parallelism in the successive forms of life in the stages of the widely separated palæozoic and tertiary periods would still be manifest and the several formations could be easily correlated these observations however relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner we may doubt whether they have thus changed if the megatherium mylodon macrauchenia and toxodon had been brought to europe from la plata without any information in regard to their geological position no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still living seashells but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the mastodon and horse it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages when the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundredthousandth year or even that it has a very strict geological sense for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in europe and all those that lived in europe during the pleistocene period an enormously remote period as measured by years including the whole glacial epoch were to be compared with those now living in south america or in australia the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere so again several highly competent observers believe that the existing productions of the united states are more closely related to those which lived in europe during certain later tertiary stages than to those which now live here and if this be so it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of north america would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older european beds nevertheless looking to a remotely future epoch there can i think be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations namely the upper pliocene the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of europe north and south america and australia from containing fossil remains in some degree allied and from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense the fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large sense at distant parts of the world has greatly struck those admirable observers mm de verneuil and darchiac after referring to the parallelism of the palæozoic forms of life in various parts of europe they add if struck by this strange sequence we turn our attention to north america and there discover a series of analogous phenomena it will appear certain that all these modifications of species their extinction and the introduction of new ones cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom m barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect it is indeed quite futile to look to changes of currents climate or other physical conditions as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world under the most different climates we must as barrande has remarked look to some special law we shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of their inhabitants this great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world is explicable on the theory of natural selection new species are formed by new varieties arising which have some advantage over older forms and those forms which are already dominant or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive we have distinct evidence on this head in the plants which are dominant that is which are commonest in their own homes and are most widely diffused having produced the greatest number of new varieties it is also natural that the dominant varying and farspreading species which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species the process of diffusion may often be very slow being dependent on climatal and geographical changes or on strange accidents but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading the diffusion would it is probable be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea we might therefore expect to find as we apparently do find a less strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species and then their triumphant course or even their existence would cease we know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species but we can i think clearly see that a number of individuals from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations and that severe competition with many already existing forms would be highly favourable as would be the power of spreading into new territories a certain amount of isolation recurring at long intervals of time would probably be also favourable as before explained one quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on the land and another for those in the waters of the sea if two great regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree whenever their inhabitants met the battle would be prolonged and severe and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be victorious but in the course of time the forms dominant in the highest degree wherever produced would tend everywhere to prevail as they prevailed they would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance whole groups would tend slowly to disappear though here and there a single member might long be enabled to survive thus as it seems to me the parallel and taken in a large sense simultaneous succession of the same forms of life throughout the world accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying the new species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over other species these again spreading varying and producing new species the forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms will generally be allied in groups from inheriting some inferiority in common and therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world old groups will disappear from the world and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond there is one other remark connected with this subject worth making i have given my reasons for believing that
