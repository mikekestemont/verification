we joined the main road to coquimbo at night there was a very light shower of rain this was the first drop that had fallen since the heavy rain of september th and th which detained me a prisoner at the baths of cauquenes the interval was seven and a half months but the rain this year in chile was rather later than usual the andes were now covered by a thick mass of snow and they presented in the distance a very glorious sight may dthe road continued to follow the coast at no great distance from the sea the few trees and bushes which are common in central chile decreased rapidly in numbers and were replaced by a tall plant something like a yucca in appearance the surface of the country on a small scale was singularly broken and irregular abrupt little peaks of rock rising out of small plains or basins the indented coast and the bottom of the neighbouring sea studded with breakers would if converted into dry land present similar forms and such a conversion without doubt has taken place in the part over which we rode dquilimari to conchalee the country became more and more barren in the valleys there was scarcely sufficient water for any irrigation and the intermediate land was quite bare not supporting even goats in the spring after the winter showers a thin pasture rapidly springs up and cattle are then driven down from the cordillera to graze for a short time it is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass seem to know as if by an acquired instinct what quantity of rain to expect one shower far northward at copiapó produces as great an effect on the vegetation as two at guasco and as three or four in this district at valparaiso a winter so dry as to injure most seriously the pasture would at guasco produce the most unusual abundance travelling northward the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict proportion to the distance at conchalee which is only halfway between valparaiso and coquimbo being miles north of the former rain is not expected till the end of may whereas at valparaiso some generally falls early in april the annual quantity is likewise small in proportion to the lateness of the season at which it commences may thfinding the coastroad devoid of interest of every kind we turned inland towards the mining district of illapel the town of that name is very regular and pretty its flourishing condition depends on numerous mines chiefly of copper which occur in its immediate vicinity this valley like every other in chile is level broad and very fertile it is bordered on each side either by cliffs of stratified shingle or by bare rocky mountains above the straight line of the uppermost irrigating ditch all is brown as on a high road while all below is of as bright a green as verdigris from the beds of alfarfa a kind of clover we proceeded to los hornos another mining district where the principal hill was drilled with holes like a great ants nest the chilian miners are in their habits a peculiar race of men living for weeks together in the most desolate spots when they descend to the villages on feastdays there is no excess or extravagance into which they do not run they sometimes gain a considerable sum and then like sailors with prizemoney they try how soon they can contrive to squander it they drink excessively buy quantities of clothes and in a few days return penniless to their miserable abodes there to work harder than beasts of burden this thoughtlessness as with sailors is evidently the result of a similar manner of life their daily food is found them and they acquire no habitual care as to the means of subsistence moreover at the same moment that temptation is offered the means of enjoying it is placed in their power on the other hand in cornwall and some other parts of england where the system of selling part of the vein is followed the miners from being obliged to act for themselves and to judge with clearness are a singularly intelligent and wellconducted set of men the dress of the chilian miner is peculiar and rather picturesque he wears a very long shirt of some darkcoloured baize with a leathern apron the whole being fastened round his waist by a brightlycoloured sash his trousers are very broad and his small cap of scarlet cloth is made to fit the head closely we met a party of these miners in full costume carrying the body of one of their companions to be buried they marched at a very quick trot four men supporting the corpse one set having run as hard as they could for about two hundred yards were relieved by four others who had previously dashed on ahead on horseback thus they proceeded encouraging each other by wild cries altogether the scene formed a most strange funeral we continued travelling northward in a zigzag line sometimes stopping a day to geologise the country was so thinly inhabited and the track so obscure that we often had difficulty in finding our way on the th i stayed at some mines the ore in this case was not considered particularly good but from being abundant it was supposed the mine would sell for about thirty or forty thousand dollars that is or pounds sterling yet it was bought by one of the english associations for an ounce of gold l s the ore is yellow pyrites which as i have already remarked before the arrival of the english was not supposed to contain a particle of copper on a scale of profits nearly as great as in the above instance piles of scoriæ abounding with minute globules of metallic copper were purchased yet with these advantages the mining associations as is well known contrived to lose immense sums of money the folly of the greater number of commissioners and shareholders amounted to infatuation a thousand pounds per annum given in some cases to entertain the authorities libraries of wellbound geological books bringing out miners for particular metals as tin which were soon found not to exist in the country contracts to supply the miners with milk in parts where there were no cows machinery where such could not possibly be used and a hundred similar arrangements bore witness to our absurdity and to this day afford amusement to the natives yet there can be no doubt that the same capital well employed in these mines would have yielded an immense return a confidential man of business a practical miner and assayer would have been all that was required captain head has described the wonderful load which the apires truly beasts of burden carry up from deep mines i confess i thought the account exaggerated so that i was glad to take the opportunity of weighing one of the loads which i picked out by hazard it required considerable exertion on my part when standing directly over it to lift it from the ground the load was considered under weight when found to be pounds the apire had carried this up eighty perpendicular yardspart of the way by a steep passage but the greater part up notched poles placed in a zigzag line in the shaft according to the general regulation the apire is not allowed to halt for breath except the mine is six hundred feet deep the average load is considered as rather more than pounds and i have been assured that one of pounds twentytwo stone and a half by way of a trial has been brought up from the deepest mine at this time the apires were bringing up the usual load twelve times in the day that is pounds from eighty yards deep and they were employed in the intervals in breaking and picking ore these men excepting from accidents are healthy and appear cheerful their bodies are not very muscular they rarely eat meat once a week and never oftener and then only the hard dry charqui although with a knowledge that the labour is voluntary it was nevertheless quite revolting to see the state in which they reached the mouth of the mine their bodies bent forward leaning with their arms on the steps their legs bowed the muscles quivering the perspiration streaming from their faces over their breasts their nostrils distended the corners of their mouth forcibly drawn back and the expulsion of their breath most laborious each time from habit they utter an articulate cry of ayay which ends in a sound rising from deep in the chest but shrill like the note of a fife after staggering to the pile of ores they emptied the carpacho in two or three seconds recovering their breath they wiped the sweat from their brows and apparently quite fresh descended the mine again at a quick pace this appears to me a wonderful instance of the amount of labour which habit for it can be nothing else will enable a man to endure in the evening talking with the mayordomo of these mines about the number of foreigners now scattered over the whole country he told me that though quite a young man he remembers when a boy at school at coquimbo a holiday being given to see the captain of an english ship who was brought to the city to speak to the governor he believes that nothing would have induced any boy in the school himself included to have gone close to the englishman so deeply had they been impressed with an idea of the heresy contamination and evil to be derived from contact with such a person to this day they relate the atrocious actions of the bucaniers and especially of one man who took away the figure of the virgin mary and returned the year after for that of st joseph saying it was a pity the lady should not have a husband i heard also of an old lady who at a dinner in coquimbo remarked how wonderfully strange it was that she should have lived to dine in the same room with an englishman for she remembered as a girl that twice at the mere cry of los ingleses every soul carrying what valuables they could had taken to the mountains may thwe reached coquimbo where we staid a few days the town is remarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness it is said to contain from to inhabitants on the morning of the th it rained lightly the first time this year for about five hours with this shower the farmers who plant corn near the seacoast where the atmosphere is more humid would break up the ground with a second put the seed in and if a third should fall they would reap in the spring a good harvest it was interesting to watch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture twelve hours afterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever yet after an interval of ten days all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches the grass being sparingly scattered in hairlike fibres a full inch in length before this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a high road in the evening captain fitzroy and myself were dining with mr edwards an english resident well known for his hospitality by all who have visited coquimbo when a sharp earthquake happened i heard the forecoming rumble but from the screams of the ladies the running of servants and the rush of several of the gentlemen to the doorway i could not distinguish the motion some of the women afterwards were crying with terror and one person said he should not be able to sleep all night or if he did it would only be to dream of falling houses the father of this gentleman had lately lost all his property at talcahuano and he himself only just escaped a falling roof at valparaiso in he mentioned a curious coincidence which then happened he was playing at cards when a german one of the party got up and said he would never sit in a room in these countries with the door shut since owing to his having done so he had nearly lost his life at copiapó accordingly he opened the door and no sooner had he done this than he cried out here it comes again and the famous shock commenced the whole party escaped the danger in an earthquake is not from the time lost in opening a door but from the chance of its becoming jammed by the movement of the walls it is impossible to be much surprised at the fear which natives and old residents though some of them known to be men of great command of mind so generally experience during earthquakes i think however this excess of panic may be partly attributed to a want of habit in governing their fears the usual restraint of shame being here absent indeed the natives do not like to see a person indifferent i heard of two englishmen who sleeping in the open air during a smart shock knowing there was no danger did not rise the natives cried out indignantly look at those heretics they will not even get out of their beds i spent two or three days in examining the stepformed terraces of shingle first described by captain basil hall in his work so full of spirited descriptions on the west coast of america mr lyell concluded from the account that they must have been formed by the sea during the gradual rising of the land such is the case on some of the steps which sweep round from within the valley so as to front the coast shells of existing species both lie on the surface and are embedded in a soft calcareous stone this bed of the most modern tertiary epoch passes downward into another containing some living species associated with others now lost amongst the latter may be mentioned shells of an enormous perna and an oyster and the teeth of a gigantic shark closely allied to or identical with the carcharias megalodon of ancient europe the bones of which or of some cetaceous animal are also present in a silicified state in great numbers at guasco the phenomenon of the parallel terraces is very strikingly seen no less than seven perfectly level but unequally broad plains ascending by steps occur on one or both sides the valley so remarkable is the contrast of the successive horizontal lines corresponding on each side with the irregular outline of the surrounding mountains that it attracts the attention of even those who feel no interest regarding the causes which have modelled the surface of the land the origin of the terraces of coquimbo is precisely the same according to my view with that of the plains of patagonia the only difference is that the plains are rather broader than the terraces and that they front the atlantic ocean instead of a valleywhich valley however was formerly occupied by an arm of the sea but now by a freshwater river in every case it must be remembered that the successive cliffs do not mark so many distinct elevations but on the contrary periods of comparative repose during the gradual and perhaps scarcely sensible rise of the land in the valley of guasco we have the record of seven such nights of rest in the action of the subterranean powers may sti set out in company with don jose edwards to the silvermine of arqueros and thence up the valley of elque or coquimbo passing through a mountainous country we reached by nightfall the mines belonging to mr edwards i enjoyed my nights rest here from a cause which will not be fully understood in england namely the absence of fleas the rooms in coquimbo swarm with them but they will not live at the elevation of three or four thousand feet even if brought there as is constantly occurring at these mines it can scarcely be the trifling diminution of temperature but some other cause which is here destructive to these troublesome insects i spent the greater part of the ensuing day in examining the mines the veins occur abundantly scattered over several miles of hilly country yet it is only a few years since that they were discovered by a woodcutter the mines are now in a bad state though they formerly yielded about pounds in weight of silver a year it has been said a person with a coppermine will gain with silver he may gain but with gold he is sure to lose this is not true all the large chilian fortunes have been made by mines of the more precious metals a short time since an english physician returned to england from copiapó taking with him the profits of one share in a silvermine which amounted to about pounds sterling no doubt a coppermine with care is a sure game whereas the other is gambling or rather taking a ticket in a lottery the owners lose great quantities of rich ores for no precautions can prevent robbery i heard of a man laying a bet with another that one of his men should rob him before his face the ore when brought out of the mine is broken into pieces and the useless stone thrown on one side a couple of the miners who were thus employed pitched as if by accident two fragments away at the same moment and then cried out for a joke let us see which rolls furthest the owner who was standing by bet a cigar with his friend on the race the miner by this means watched the very point amongst the rubbish where the stone lay in the evening he picked it up and carried it to his master showing him a rich mass of silver ore and saying this was the stone on which you won a cigar by its rolling so far may dwe followed up the fertile valley till we reached an hacienda belonging to a relation of don jose where we stayed the ensuing day i then rode one days journey further to see what were declared to be some petrified shells and beans the former turned out to be so the latter were small quartz pebbles we passed through several small villages and the valley was beautifully cultivated and the whole scenery very grand we were here near the main cordillera and the surrounding hills were very lofty in all parts of northern chile fruittrees produce much more abundantly at a considerable elevation near the andes than in the lower country the figs and grapes of this part are famous for their superiority and are cultivated to a great extent this valley is perhaps the most productive one north of quillota i believe it contains including coquimbo inhabitants the next day i returned to the hacienda and thence together with don jose to coquimbo june dwe set out for the valley of guasco following the coastroad which was considered rather less desert than the other our first days ride was to a solitary house called yerba buena where there was pasture for our horses the shower mentioned as having fallen a fortnight ago only reached about halfway to guasco we had therefore in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge of green which soon faded away even where brightest it was scarcely sufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers during the spring of other countries while travelling through these deserts one feels like a prisoner shut up in a gloomy courtyard longing to see something green and to smell a moist atmosphere june dyerba buena to carizal during the first part of the day we crossed a mountainous rocky desert and afterwards a long deep sandy plain scattered over with broken marine shells there was very little water and that little saline hence the few streamlets were bordered on each side by white incrustations amongst which succulent saltloving plants grew the whole country from the coast to the cordillera is desert and uninhabited i saw traces only of one living animal in abundance this was a bulimus the shells of which were collected together in extraordinary numbers on the driest spots in the spring one humble little plant sends out a few leaves and on these the snails feed as they are seen only very early in the morning when the ground is slightly damp from the dew the guasos believe they are born from it i have observed in other places that extremely dry and sterile districts where the soil is calcareous are most favourable to an extraordinary increase of landshells at carizal there were a few cottages some brackish water and a trace of cultivation but it was with difficulty that we purchased a little corn and straw for our horses thcarizal to sauce we continued to ride over desert plains tenanted by large herds of guanaco we crossed also the valley of chaneral which although the most fertile one between guasco and coquimbo is very narrow and produces so little pasture that we could not purchase any for our horses at sauce we found a very civil old gentleman superintending a coppersmelting furnace as an especial favour he allowed me to purchase at a high price an armful of dirty straw which was all the poor horses had for supper after their long days journey very few smelting furnaces are now at work in any part of chile it is found more profitable on account of the extreme scarcity of firewood and of the loss from the clumsy chilian method of reduction to ship the ore for swansea the next day we crossed some mountains to freyrina in the valley of guasco during each days ride further northward the vegetation became more scanty even the great candlestick cactus was here replaced by a different and much smaller species during the winter months both in northern chile and in peru a uniform stratum of clouds hangs at no great height over the pacific from these mountains we had a very striking view of the great white and brilliant field which sent arms up the valleys leaving islands and promontories in the same manner as the sea now intersects the chonos archipelago or the west coast of tierra del fuego we staid two days at freyrina in the valley of guasco there are four small towns at the mouth there is the port a spot entirely desert and without any water in the immediate neighbourhood five leagues higher up stands freyrina a long straggling village with decent whitewashed houses again ten leagues further up ballenar is situated and above this guasco alto a horticultural village famous for its dried fruit on a clear day the view up the valley is very fine the straight opening is terminated at a great distance by the outline of the snowy cordillera on each side an infinity of crossing lines blend together in a beautiful haze the foreground is singular from the number of parallel and extensive terraces and the included strip of green valley with its willow bushes is contrasted on both hands by the naked hills that the surrounding country was most barren will be readily believed from the circumstance of a shower of rain not having fallen during the last thirteen months the inhabitants heard with the greatest envy of the rain in coquimbo from the appearance of the atmosphere they had strong expectations of equally good fortune which a fortnight afterwards was realized i was at copiapó at the time and there the people with equal envy talked of the abundant rain at guasco after two or three very dry years perhaps with not more than one shower during the whole time a rainy year generally follows and this does more harm than even the drought the river swells and covers with gravel and sand the narrow strip of ground which alone is fit for cultivation the flood also injures the irrigating ditches great devastation had thus been caused three years ago june thwe rode on to ballenar as the rocky mountains on each hand were concealed by clouds the terracelike plains gave the valley an appearance similar to that of santa cruz in patagonia i staid the following day in the town which is as large as coquimbo and well built it has only lately sprung up and entirely owes its prosperity to some silvermines ballenar takes its name from ballenagh in ireland the birthplace of the family of ohiggins who under the spanish government were presidents and generals in chile thinstead of going direct to the town of copiapó i determined to fall into the valley higher up and nearer the cordillera we rode all day over an uninteresting country i am tired of repeating the epithets barren and sterile these words however as commonly used are comparative i have always applied them to the plains of patagonia yet the vegetation there can boast of spiny bushes and some tufts of grass which is absolute fertility to any thing that can be seen here and here again there are not many spaces of two hundred yards square where some little bush cactus or lichen may not be discovered by careful examination and in the soil seeds lie dormant ready to spring up during the first rainy winter in peru real deserts occur over wide tracts of country in the evening we arrived at a valley in which the bed of the streamlet was damp following it up we came to tolerably good water during the night the stream before it is evaporated and absorbed flows a league lower down than during the day sticks were plentiful for firewood so that it was a good place of bivouac for us but for the poor animals there was not a mouthful for them to eat june thwe rode without stopping for twelve hours till we reached an old smelting furnace where there was water and firewood but our horses again had nothing to eat being shut up in an old courtyard the line of road was hilly and the distant views interesting from the splendid weather and the varied colours of the bare mountains it is a pity to see the sun shining constantly over so useless a country such days should brighten a prospect of fields and gardens the next day we reached the valley of copiapó i was heartily glad of it for the whole journey was a continued source of anxiety it was most disagreeable to hear whilst eating our own supper our horses gnawing the posts to which they were tied and to have no means of relieving their hunger to all appearance however the animals were quite fresh and no one could have told that they had eaten nothing for the last fiftyfive hours i had a letter of introduction to mr bingley who received me very kindly at the hacienda of potrero seco this estate is between twenty and thirty miles long but it is very narrow having generally a width of only two fields one on each side the river in some parts the estate is of no width that is to say the land cannot be irrigated and therefore is valueless like the surrounding rocky desert the small quantity of cultivated land in the whole line of valley does not however so much depend on its inequality or its unfitness for irrigation as on the small supply of water the river this year was remarkably full in this part it reached as high as the horses belly and was about fifteen yards wide and rapid it gradually decreases in volume till reaching the sea this latter circumstance however rarely happens and once for a period of thirty years not a drop entered the pacific the inhabitants watch a storm over the cordillera with great interest as one good fall of snow provides them with water for the ensuing year this is of infinitely more consequence than rain in the lower country the latter as often as it occurs which is about once in every two or three years is a great advantage because the cattle and mules can for some time afterwards find pasture in the mountains but without snow in the andes desolation extends throughout the valley it is on record that three times nearly all the inhabitants have been obliged to emigrate to the south this year there was plenty of water and every man irrigated his ground as much as he chose but it has frequently been necessary to post soldiers at the sluices to see that each estate took only its proper allowance during so many hours in the week the valley is said to contain souls but its produce is sufficient only for three months in the year the rest of the supply being drawn from valparaiso and the south before the discovery of the famous silvermines of chanuncillo copiapó was in a rapid state of decay but now it is in a very thriving condition and the town which was completely overthrown by an earthquake has been rebuilt the valley of copiapó forming a mere ribbon of green in a desert runs in a very southerly direction so that it is of considerable length to its origin in the cordillera the valleys of guasco and copiapó may both be considered as islands to the northward of chile separated by deserts instead of salt water beyond these there is one other very miserable valley called paposo which contains about people and then there extends the real desert of atacamaa barrier far worse than the most turbulent ocean after staying a few days at potrero seco i proceeded up the valley to the house of don benito cruz to whom i had a letter of introduction i found him most hospitable indeed it is impossible to bear too strong testimony to the kindness which travellers receive in almost every part of south america the next day i hired some mules to take me by the ravine of jolquera into the central cordillera on the second night the weather seemed to foretel a storm of snow or rain and whilst lying in our beds we felt a trifling shock of an earthquake the connexion between the latter phenomena and the weather has often been a disputed point it appears to me to be one of very great interest and not well understood humboldt has remarked it would be difficult for a person who has lived a long time in new andalusia or in the low regions of peru to deny that the season the most to be dreaded from the frequency of earthquakes is that of the beginning of the rains which is however the time of thunderstorms the atmosphere and the state of the surface of the globe seem to have an influence unknown to us on the changes produced at great depths in northern chile from the extreme infrequency of rain or even of weather foreboding rain the probability of accidental coincidences between the two phenomena necessarily becomes very small yet the inhabitants in that part are most firmly convinced of some connexion between the state of the atmosphere and the tremblings of the ground i was much struck by this when mentioning to some people at copiapó that there had been a sharp shock at coquimbo they immediately cried how fortunate there will be plenty of pasture there this year to their minds an earthquake foretold rain as surely as rain foretold abundant pasture certainly it did so happen that on the very day of the earthquake that shower of rain fell which i have described as in ten days producing a thin sprinkling of grass mr scrope has put forth an ingenious idea that the period of subterranean disturbance where the force is just on a balance with the resistance may be determined by a sudden decrease in atmospheric pressure which over a wide extent of country might produce a considerable effect according to this explanation the earthquake comes on at the given period from that state of the weather which is generally accompanied by rain but there is another class of phenomena where the state of the weather evidently appears a consequence and not the determining cause of the earthquake i allude to those cases when rain falls at a period of the year at which it is a greater prodigy than the earthquake itself i may instance the rain after the shock of november at valparaiso a person must be somewhat habituated to these climates to understand the excessive improbability of rain falling at such seasons except as a consequence of some law quite unconnected with the ordinary course of the weather in the case of great volcanic eruptions as that of coseguina where torrents of rain fell at a time of year most unusual for it and almost unprecedented in central america it is not difficult to understand that the volumes of vapour and clouds of ashes might have disturbed the atmospheric equilibrium humboldt extends this view to the case of earthquakes but for my part i cannot conceive it possible that the small quantity of aeriform fluid which at such times escapes from the fissured ground can produce such remarkable effects humboldt has stated that on the days when the earth is shaken by violent shocks the regularity of the horary variations of the barometer is not disturbed under the tropics i have verified this observation at cumana at lima and at riobamba and it is so much the more worthy of fixing the attention of natural philosophers as at st domingo at the town of cape françois it is asserted that a water barometer was observed to sink two inches and a half immediately before the earthquake of in the same manner it is related that at the destruction of oran a druggist fled with his family because observing accidentally a few minutes before the earthquake the height of the mercury in his barometer he perceived that the column sunk in an extraordinary manner i know not whether we can give credit to this assertion mr alison in a letter dated valparaiso informs me that just before the earthquake of november the mercury in the tube of the barometer standing in his store sank beneath the graduated part the tube was a bent one nineteen inches being exposed and the lowest graduated part corresponded to twentysix english inches with this third case and more especially considering the unquestionable fact of rain so frequently following severe earthquakes even at the most unusual seasons i cannot conclude otherwise than that there exists some connexion between the subterranean and atmospheric disturbances of which we are at present quite ignorant mr miers in his account of the valparaiso earthquake november th has added one more to the list of coincidences between luminous meteors and earthquakes he says one of very considerable size in apparent dimensions little less than the moon was observed in the southward at no very great elevation it traversed a considerable arch of the heavens leaving behind it a long train of light and when it disappeared it seemed to do so from explosionas it leaped in the same manner as those which eject meteoric stones but in this instance no noise was heard to attend its extinction nor was it known that any stones fell this occurred about halfpast two oclock in the morning after the earthquake the earthquake itself happened at halfpast ten oclock mr miers then adds that a friend of his travelling on the night of the th of november about a fortnight preceding the great earthquake observed at a little past eleven oclock in the northern sky a large meteor of great splendour it is remarkable that on this same day according to the journal of science copiapó to the northward was visited by a severe earthquake which on the fifth was followed by a much more violent shock molina states that the first shock which announced the great earthquake at midnight on the th of may was accompanied by a ball of fire which precipitated itself from the andes toward the sea it is said in the encyclo metropol art meteorologyat kingston in jamaica in november a large meteor appeared a few minutes previous to some alarming and tremendous concussions aguerros states on the authority of ovalle that in the morning of may th carelmapu north of chiloe was overthrown by a bad earthquake accompanied by a great noise and that while the people were considering the cause they saw over a high hill near the village a globe of fire which appeared to threaten the last day it rose and quickly proceeded so as to fall in the sea disturbing the neighbouring waters this was accompanied by a great tempest darkness and a hailstorm in which pieces of ice fell as large as musketballs i have copied the foregoing notices because under any point of view it is remarkable that in one quarter of the globe there should have been so many coincidences between phenomena of not very common occurrence it must however be observed that the coincidence is not precise the meteors having been seen in some cases a little before in others a little after the earthquake from the account given in aguerros of the waters of the sea having been disturbed and from that by miers of an apparent explosion it would appear that these meteors must be the same with those that accompany the fall of meteoric stones this perhaps alone is an argument that they are accidental accompaniments of earthquakes for there seems to be no rational method of explaining the origin of meteorolites on any hypothesis directly connected with our world it is however very singular that all their constituent parts should be of the same nature as those found on this earththat the metals should be chiefly those most subject to magnetic influenceand that olivine should frequently be present a mineral which is exclusively confined to a certain class of volcanic products to return to the valley of copiapó finding little of interest in this part of the ravine we retraced our steps to the house of don benito where i staid two days collecting fossil shells and silicified wood the latter was present in the most extraordinary quantity it was here that i found a cylindrical trunk fifteen feet in circumference projecting from the side of a hill it was amusing to hear discussions concerning the nature of the fossil shellswhether or not they had been thus born by naturecarried on almost in the same terms as were used a century before in europe my geological examination of the country generally created a good deal of surprise amongst the chilenos it was long before they would be convinced that i was not hunting for mines this was sometimes troublesome i found the most ready way of explaining my employment was to ask them how it was that they themselves were not curious concerning earthquakes and volcanoes why some springs were hot and others coldwhy there were mountains in chile and not a hill in la plata these bare questions at once satisfied and silenced the greater number some however like a few in england who are a century behindhand thought that all such inquiries were useless and impious and that it was quite sufficient that god had thus made the mountains an order had recently been issued that all stray dogs should be killed and we saw many carcasses lying on the high road a great number had lately been affected with hydrophobia and several men had been bitten and had died in consequence on other occasions hydrophobia has prevailed in this valley it is remarkable thus to find so strange and dreadful a disease appearing time after time in the same isolated spot it has been remarked that certain villages in england are in like manner much more subject to this visitation than others hydrophobia must be extremely rare on the eastern side of the andes for azara thought it was unknown in america and ulloa says the same with respect to quito i could not hear of a case having occurred in van diemens land or in australia and burchell says during the five years he was at the cape of good hope he never heard of an instance of it webster again asserts that at the azores hydrophobia has never occurred and the same observation has been made with respect to mauritius and st helena in so strange a disease some information might possibly be gained by considering the circumstances under which it originates in distant climates at night a stranger arrived at the house of don benito and asked permission to sleep there he said he had been wandering about the mountains for seventeen days having lost his way he started from guasco and being accustomed to the mountains did not expect any difficulty in following the track to copiapó but he soon became involved in a labyrinth of mountains whence he could not escape some of his mules had fallen over precipices and he had been in great distress his chief difficulty arose from not knowing where to find water in the lower country so that he was obliged to keep bordering the central ranges we returned down the valley and on the d reached the town of copiapó the lower part of the valley is broad forming a fine plain like that of aconcagua or quillota the town covers a considerable space of ground each house possessing a garden but it is an uncomfortable place and the dwellings are poorly furnished every one seems bent on the one object of making money and then migrating as quickly as possible all the inhabitants are more or less directly concerned with mines and mines and ores are the the sole subjects of conversation necessaries of all sorts are very dear as the distance from the town to the port is eighteen leagues and the land carriage very expensive a fowl costs five or six shillings meat is nearly as dear as in england firewood or rather sticks are brought on donkeys from a distance of two and three days journey within the cordillera and pasturage for animals is a shilling a day all this for south america is wonderfully exorbitant june thi hired a guide and eight mules to take me into the cordillera by a different line from my last expedition as the country was utterly desert we took a cargo and a half of barley mixed with chopped straw about two leagues above the town a broad valley called the despoblado or uninhabited branches off from the one by which we had descended although a valley of the grandest dimensions and leading to a pass across the cordillera yet it is completely dry excepting perhaps for a few days during some very rainy winter the bottom of the main valley was nearly flat and the sides of the crumbling mountains were but little furrowed by ravines no considerable river could ever have poured its waters over the bed of shingle without having excavated a channel similar to those occurring in the southern valleys i feel little doubt that it was left in the state we now see it by the gradually retiring sea the dry valleys mentioned by travellers in peru probably owe their origin to a similar agency and not to the running streams of any former period i observed in one place where a ravine which amongst any other mountains would have been called a grand valley joined the despoblado that the bed of the latter though composed merely of sand and gravel was higher than that of its tributary a mere rivulet of water in the course of an hour would have cut a channel for itself but it was evident that centuries had passed away and no such rivulet had drained these great valleys it was curious to behold this machinery if such a term may be used for the drainage all with the last trifling exception perfect yet without any signs of activity every one must have remarked how mudbanks left by the retiring tide imitate in miniature a country with hill and dale and here we find a model only on a grander scale formed by the waves of a retiring ocean let thousands of years replace minutes of the tidal change and the difference between soft mud and hard rock will barely modify the result if a shower of rain falls on the mudbank when left dry it deepens the shallow lines of excavation and so will it be with the rain of successive centuries on the bank of rock and soil which we call a continent we rode on after it was dark till we reached a side ravine with a small well called agua amarga the water deserved its name for besides being saline it was most offensively putrid and bitter so that we could not force ourselves to drink either tea or maté i suppose the distance from the river of copiapó to this spot was at least twentyfive or thirty english miles in the whole space there was not a single drop of water the country almost deserving the name of desert in the strictest sense yet about halfway we passed the old indian ruins near punta gorda which i have already mentioned i noticed also in front of some of the valleys which branch off from the despoblado two piles of stones placed a little distance apart and directed so as to point up the mouth of the small valley my companions knew nothing about them and only answered my queries by their imperturbable quien sabe june thwe set out early in the morning and by midday reached the ravine of paypote where there is a tiny rill of water with a little vegetation and even a few algarroba a mimosa trees on this latter account a smelting furnace had formerly been built here we found a solitary man in charge of it whose sole employment was hunting guanacoes at night it froze sharply but having plenty of firewood we kept ourselves warm thwe continued gradually ascending as we followed the valley which now had assumed the character of a ravine during the day we saw several guanacoes and the track of the closelyallied species called the vicuna this latter animal is preeminently alpine in its habits it seldom descends much below the limit of perpetual snow and therefore haunts even a more lofty and sterile situation than the guanaco the only other animal which we saw in any number was a small fox i suppose this animal preys on the mice and other small rodents which as long as there is the least vegetation subsist in considerable numbers in very desert places in patagonia even on the borders of the salinas where a drop of fresh water can never be found these little animals swarm next to lizards mice appear to be able to support existence on the smallest and driest portions of the eartheven on islets in the midst of great oceans i believe it will be found that several islands which possess no other warmblooded quadruped have small rodents peculiar to themselves the scenery on all sides showed desolation brightened and made palpable by a clear unclouded sky custom excludes the feeling of sublimity and when this is wanting such scenery is rather the reverse of interesting we bivouacked at the primera linea or the first line of the partition of the waters the streams however on the east side do not flow to the atlantic but into an elevated district in the middle of which there is a large salina or salt lake thus forming a little caspian sea at the elevation perhaps of ten thousand feet where we slept there were some considerable patches of snow but they do not remain throughout the year the winds in these lofty regions obey very regular laws every day a fresh breeze blows up the valley and at night an hour or two after sunset the air from the cold regions above descends as through a funnel this night it blew a gale of wind and the temperature must have been considerably below the freezingpoint for water in a short time became a block of ice no clothes seemed to oppose any obstacle to the air i suffered very much from the cold so that i could not sleep and in the morning rose with my body quite dull and benumbed in the cordillera further southward people lose their lives from snowstorms here this sometimes happens from another cause my guide when a boy of fourteen years old was passing the cordillera with some others in the month of may and while in the central parts a furious gale of wind arose so that the men could hardly stick on their mules and stones were flying along the ground the day was cloudless and not a speck of snow fell but the temperature was low it is probable that the thermometer would not have stood very many degrees below the freezingpoint but the effect on their bodies ill protected by clothing would be in proportion to the rapidity of the current of cold air the gale lasted for more than a day the men began to lose all their strength and the mules would not move onwards my guides brother tried to return but he perished and his body was found two years afterwards lying by the side of his mule near the road with the bridle still in his hand two other men in the party lost their fingers and toes and out of two hundred mules and thirty cows only fourteen of the former escaped alive many years ago the whole of a large party are supposed to have perished from a similar cause but their bodies to this day have never been discovered the union of a cloudless sky low temperature and a furious gale of wind must be i should think in all parts of the world an unusual occurrence june thwe gladly travelled down the valley to our former nights lodging and thence to near the agua amarga on july st we reached the valley of copiapó the smell of the fresh clover was quite delightful after the scentless air of the dry sterile despoblado whilst staying in the town i heard an account from several of the inhabitants of a hill in the neighbourhood which they called el bramadorthe roarer or bellower i did not at the time pay sufficient attention to the account but as far as i understood the hill was covered by sand and the noise was produced only when people by ascending it put the sand in motion upon reading an article in the edinburgh journal i was surprised to find the same circumstances described in detail on the authority of seetzen and ehrenbergh as the cause of the sounds which have been heard by many travellers on mount sinai near the red sea one person with whom i conversed had himself heard the noise he described it as very surprising and he distinctly stated that although he could not understand how it was effected yet it was necessary to set the sand rolling down the acclivity i can vouch for the quantity of loose sand lying on the bare granite mountains in this neighbourhood from the position of the hill and from the account which i received the phenomenon certainly does not appear to have any direct connexion with volcanic causes i may remark that a horse walking over dry and coarse sand causes a peculiar chirping noise from the friction of the particles a fact which i have several times noticed on the coast of brazil three days afterwards i heard of the beagles arrival at the port which is distant eighteen leagues there is very little land cultivated below the town the wide expanse of the valley supports a wretched wiry grass which even the donkeys can hardly eat this poorness of the vegetation is owing to the quantity of saline matter with which the soil is impregnated layers of sulphate and carbonate of soda even several inches thick occur in some parts the port consists of an assemblage of miserable little hovels situated at the foot of some sterile plains and hills at present from the river reaching the sea the inhabitants enjoy the advantage of having fresh water within a mile and a half on the beach there were large piles of merchandise and the little place had an air of activity in the evening i gave my adios with a hearty good will to my companion mariano gonzales with whom i had ridden so many leagues in chile the next morning the beagle sailed for iquique lat on the coast of peru july thwe anchored in the port of iquique the town contains about a thousand inhabitants and stands on a little plain of sand at the foot of a great wall of rock feet in height which here forms the coast the whole is utterly desert a light shower of rain falls only once in very many years and hence the ravines are filled with detritus and the mountain sides covered by piles of fine white sand even a thousand feet high during this season of the year a heavy bank of clouds extending parallel to the ocean seldom rises above the wall of rocks on the coast the aspect of the place was most gloomy the little port with its few vessels and small group of wretched houses seemed overwhelmed and out of all proportion with the rest of the scene the inhabitants live like persons on board a ship every necessary coming from a distance water is brought in boats from pisagua about forty miles to the northward and is sold at the rate of nine reals s d an eighteengallon cask i bought a winebottle full for threepence in like manner firewood and of course every article of food is imported very few animals can be maintained in such a place on the ensuing morning i hired with difficulty at the price of four pounds sterling two mules and a guide to take me to the saltpetre works these are the present support of iquique during one year the value of one hundred thousand pounds sterling was exported to france and england this saltpetre does not properly deserve to be so called for it consists of nitrate of soda and not of potash and is therefore of much less value it is said to be principally used in the manufacture of nitric acid owing to its deliquescent property it will not serve for gunpowder formerly there were two exceedingly rich silvermines in this neighbourhood but they now produce very little our arrival in the offing caused some little apprehension peru was in a state of anarchy and each party having demanded a contribution the poor town of iquique was in tribulation thinking the evil hour was come the people had also their domestic troubles a short time before three french carpenters had broken open the two churches during the same night and stolen all the plate one of the robbers however subsequently confessed and the plate was recovered the convicts were sent to arequipa which though the capital of this province is leagues distant the government there thought it a pity to punish such useful workmen who could make all sorts of furniture and accordingly liberated them things being in this state the churches were again broken open but the plate this time was not recovered the inhabitants became dreadfully enraged and declaring that none but heretics would thus eat god almighty proceeded to torture some englishmen with the intention of afterwards shooting them at last the authorities interfered and peace was established july thin the morning i started for the saltpetre works a distance of fourteen leagues having ascended the steep coast mountains by a zigzag sandy track we soon came in view of the mines of guantajaya and st rosa these two small villages are placed at the very mouths of the mines if the town of iquique appeared desolate these perched up on hills had a still more unnatural aspect we did not reach the saltpetre works till after sunset having ridden all day across an undulating country a complete and utter desert the road was strewed with the bones and dried skins of the many beasts of burden which had perished on it from fatigue excepting the vultur aura which preys on the carcasses i saw neither bird quadruped reptile or insect on the coast mountains at the elevation of about feet where during this season the clouds generally hang a very few cacti were growing in the clefts of rock and the loose sand was strewed over with a simple lichen which lies on the surface quite unattached this plant belongs to the genus cladonia and somewhat resembles the reindeer lichen in some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand as seen from a distance of a pale yellowish colour further inland during the whole ride of fourteen leagues i saw only one other vegetable production and that was a most minute yellow lichen growing on the bones of the dead mules this was the first true desert which i had seen the effect on me was not impressive but i believe this was owing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes as i rode northward from valparaiso through coquimbo to copiapó the appearance of the country was remarkable from being covered by a thick crust of common salt and of a saliferous sandstone which properly deserves the name of alluvium the salt is white very hard and compact it occurs in waterworn nodules which project from the agglutinated sand or soft sandstone the appearance of this superficial mass very closely resembled that of a country after snow before the last dirty patches have thawed the rocks of which the mountains are composed are saliferous and i imagine the very small quantity of rain that falls is sufficient only to wash the salt from the higher strata and that afterwards it concretes in nodules and patches in the sandy soil of the valleys whatever its origin may be the existence of a crust of a soluble substance over the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily dry the climate must have been for a period long antecedent at night i slept at the house of the owner of one of the saltpetre mines the country is here equally unproductive with that near the coast but water though having rather a bitter and brackish taste can be procured by digging the well at this house was thirtysix yards deep as scarcely any rain falls it is evident the water is not derived from that source indeed if it were it could not fail to be as salt as brine for the whole surrounding country is incrusted with various saline substances we must therefore conclude that it percolates from some distant and more humid region probably the mountains of the higher cordillera in that direction there are a few small villages
