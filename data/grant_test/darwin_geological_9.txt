and conformably deposited over the pampean strata punta alta is situated about thirty miles higher up on the northern side of this same bay it consists of a small plain between twenty and thirty feet in height cut off on the shore by a line of low cliffs about a mile in length represented in the diagram with its vertical scale necessarily exaggerated the lower bed a is more extensive than the upper ones it consists of stratified gravel or conglomerate cemented by calcareoarenaceous matter and is divided by curvilinear layers of pinkish marl of which some are precisely like toscarock and some more sandy the beds are curvilinear owing to the action of currents and dip in different directions they include an extraordinary number of bones of gigantic mammifers and many shells the pebbles are of considerable size and are of hard sandstone and of quartz like that of the ventana there are also a few wellrounded masses of toscarock the second bed b is about fifteen feet in thickness but towards both extremities of the cliff not included in the diagram it either thins out and dies away or passes insensibly into an overlying bed of gravel it consists of red tough clayey mud with minute linear cavities it is marked with faint horizontal shades of colour it includes a few pebbles and rarely a minute particle of shell in one spot the dermal armour and a few bones of a dasypoid quadruped were embedded in it it fills up furrows in the underlying gravel with the exception of the few pebbles and particles of shells this bed resembles the true pampean mud but it still more closely resembles the clayey flats mentioned in the eighth chapter separating the successively rising parallel ranges of sanddunes the bed c is of stratified gravel like the lowest one it fills up furrows in the underlying red mud and is sometimes interstratified with it and sometimes insensibly passes into it as the red mud thins out this upper gravel thickens shells are more numerous in it than in the lower gravel but the bones though some are still present are less numerous in one part however where this gravel and the red mud passed into each other i found several bones and a tolerably perfect head of the megatherium some of the large volutas though embedded in the gravelbed c were filled with the red mud including great numbers of the little recent paludestrina australis these three lower beds are covered by an unconformable mantle d of stratified sandy earth including many pebbles of quartz pumice and phonolite land and seashells all these shells now live on this coast and most of them in this same bay i was also struck with the fact that the proportional numbers of the different kinds appeared to be the same with those now cast up on the beach in both cases specimens of voluta crepidula venus and trochus are the most abundant four or five of the species are the same with the upraised shells on the pampas near buenos ayres all the specimens have a very ancient and bleached appearance and do not emit when heated an animal odour some of them are changed throughout into a white soft fibrous substance others have the space between the external walls either hollow or filled up with crystalline carbonate of lime the remains of the extinct mammiferous animals from the two gravel beds have been described by professor owen in the zoology of the voyage of the beagle they consist of st one nearly perfect head and three fragments of heads of the megatherium cuvierii nd a lower jaw of megalonyx jeffersonii rd lower jaw of mylodon darwinii th fragments of a head of some gigantic edental quadruped th an almost entire skeleton of the great scelidotherium leptocephalum with most of the bones including the head vertebræ ribs some of the extremities to the clawbone and even as remarked by professor owen the kneecap all nearly in their proper relative positions th fragments of the jaw and a separate tooth of a toxodon belonging either to t platensis or to a second species lately discovered near buenos ayres th a tooth of equus curvidens th tooth of a pachyderm closely allied to palæotherium of which parts of the head have been lately sent from buenos ayres to the british museum in all probability this pachyderm is identical with the macrauchenia patachonica from port s julian hereafter to be referred to lastly and thly in a cliff of the red clayey bed b there was a double piece about three feet long and two wide of the bony armour of a large dasypoid quadruped with the two sides pressed nearly close together as the cliff is now rapidly washing away this fossil probably was lately much more perfect from between its doubledup sides i extracted the middle and ungueal phalanges united together of one of the feet and likewise a separate phalang hence one or more of the limbs must have been attached to the deimal case when it was embedded besides these several remains in a distinguishable condition there were very many single bones the greater number were embedded in a space yards square the preponderance of the edental quadrupeds is remarkable as is in contrast with the beds of monte hermoso the absence of rodents most of the bones are now in a soft and friable condition and like the shells do not emit when burnt an animal odour the decayed state of the bones may be partly owing to their late exposure to the air and tidal waves barnacles serpulæ and corallines are attached to many of the bones but i neglected to observe whether these might not have grown on them since being exposed to the present tidal action but i believe that some of the barnacles must have grown on the scelidotherium soon after being deposited and before being wholly covered up by the gravel besides the remains in the condition here described i found one single fragment of bone very much rolled and as black as jet so as perfectly to resemble some of the remains from monte hermoso very many of the bones had been broken abraded and rolled before being embedded others even some of those included in the coarsest parts of the now hard conglomerate still retain all their minutest prominences perfectly preserved so that i conclude that they probably were protected by skin flesh or ligaments whilst being covered up in the case of the scelidotherium it is quite certain that the whole skeleton was held together by its ligaments when deposited in the gravel in which i found it some cervical vertebræ and a humerus of corresponding size lay so close together as did some ribs and the bones of a leg that i thought that they must originally have belonged to two skeletons and not have been washed in single but as remains were here very numerous i will not lay much stress on these two cases we have just seen that the armour of the dasypoid quadruped was certainly embedded together with some of the bones of the feet professor ehrenberg has examined for me specimens of the finer matter from in contact with these mammiferous remains he finds in them two polygastrica decidedly marine forms and six phytolitharia of which one is probably marine and the others either of freshwater or terrestrial origin only one of these eight microscopical bodies is common to the nine from monte hermoso but five of them are in common with those from the pampean mud on the banks of the parana the presence of any freshwater infusoria considering the aridity of the surrounding country is here remarkable the most probable explanation appears to be that these microscopical organisms were washed out of the adjoining great pampean formation during its denudation and afterwards redeposited we will now see what conclusions may be drawn from the facts above detailed it is certain that the gravelbeds and intermediate red mud were deposited within the period when existing species of mollusca held to each other nearly the same relative proportions as they do on the present coast these beds from the number of littoral species must have been accumulated in shallow water but not judging from the stratification of the gravel and the layers of marl on a beach from the manner in which the red clay fills up furrows in the underlying gravel and is in some parts itself furrowed by the overlying gravel whilst in other parts it either insensibly passes into or alternates with this upper gravel we may infer several local changes in the currents perhaps caused by slight changes up or down in the level of the land by the elevation of these beds to which period the alluvial mantle with pumicepebbles land and seashells belongs the plain of punta alta from twenty to thirty feet in height was formed in this neighbourhood there are other and higher seaformed plains and lines of cliffs in the pampean formation worn by the denuding action of the waves at different levels hence we can easily understand the presence of rounded masses of toscarock in this lowest plain and likewise as the cliffs at monte hermoso with their mammiferous remains stand at a higher level the presence of the one muchrolled fragment of bone which was as black as jet possibly some few of the other muchrolled bones may have been similarly derived though i saw only the one fragment in the same condition with those from monte hermoso m dorbigny has suggested that all these mammiferous remains may have been washed out of the pampean formation and afterwards redeposited together with the recent shells undoubtedly it is a marvellous fact that these numerous gigantic quadrupeds belonging with the exception of the equus curvidens to seven extinct genera and one namely the toxodon not falling into any existing family should have coexisted with mollusca all of which are still living species but analogous facts have been observed in n america and in europe in the first place it should not be overlooked that most of the coembedded shells have a more ancient and altered appearance than the bones in the second place is it probable that numerous bones not hardened by silex or any other mineral could have retained their delicate prominences and surfaces perfect if they had been washed out of one deposit and reembedded in anotherthis later deposit being formed of large hard pebbles arranged by the action of currents or breakers in shallow water into variously curved and inclined layers the bones which are now in so perfect a state of preservation must i conceive have been fresh and sound when embedded and probably were protected by skin flesh or ligaments the skeleton of the scelidotherium indisputably was deposited entire shall we say that when held together by its matrix it was washed out of an old gravelbed totally unlike in character to the pampean formation and reembedded in another gravelbed composed i speak after careful comparison of exactly the same kind of pebbles in the same kind of cement i will lay no stress on the two cases of several ribs and bones of the extremities having apparently been embedded in their proper relative position but will anyone be so bold as to affirm that it is possible that a piece of the thin tessellated armour of a dasypoid quadruped at least three feet long and two in width and now so tender that i was unable with the utmost care to extract a fragment more than two or three inches square could have been washed out of one bed and reembedded in another together with some of the small bones of the feet without having been dashed into atoms we must then wholly reject m dorbignys supposition and admit as certain that the scelidotherium and the large dasypoid quadruped and as highly probable that the toxodon megatherium c some of the bones of which are perfectly preserved were embedded for the first time and in a fresh condition in the strata in which they were found entombed these gigantic quadrupeds therefore though belonging to extinct genera and families coexisted with the twenty aboveenumerated mollusca the barnacle and two corals still living on this coast from the rolled fragment of black bone and from the plain of punta alta being lower than that of monte hermoso i conclude that the coarse sublittoral deposits of punta alta are of subsequent origin to the pampean mud of monte hermoso and the beds at this latter place as we have seen are probably of subsequent origin to the high toscaplain round the sierra ventana we shall however return at the end of this chapter to the consideration of these several stages in the great pampean formation buenos ayres to st fé bajada in entre riosfor some distance northward of buenos ayres the escarpment of the pampean formation does not approach very near to the plata and it is concealed by vegetation but in sections on the banks of the rios luxan areco and arrecifes i observed both pale and dark reddish pampean mud with small whitish concretions of tosca at all these places mammiferous remains have been found in the cliffs on the parana at san nicolas the pampean mud contains but little tosca here m dorbigny found the remains of two rodents ctenomys bonariensis and kerodon antiquus and the jaw of a canis when on the river i could clearly distinguish in this fine line of cliffs horizontal lines of variation both in tint and compactness the plain northward of this point is very level but with some depressions and lakes i estimated its height at from forty to sixty feet above the parana at the a medio the bright red pampean mud contains scarcely any toscarock whilst at a short distance the stream of the pabon forms a cascade about twenty feet in height over a cavernous mass of two varieties of tosca rock of which one is very compact and semicrystalline with seams of crystallised carbonate of lime similar compact varieties are met with on the salidillo and seco the absolute identity i speak after a comparison of my specimens between some of these varieties and those from tapalguen and from the ridge south of bahia blanca a distance of miles of latitude is very striking at resario there is but little toscarock near this place i first noticed at the edge of the river traces of an underlying formation which twentyfive miles higher up in the estancia of gorodona consists of a pale yellowish clay abounding with concretionary cylinders of a ferruginous sandstone this bed which is probably the equivalent of the older tertiary marine strata immediately to be described in entre rios only just rises above the level of the parana when low the rest of the cliff at gorodona is formed of red pampean mud with in the lower part many concretions of tosca some stalactiformed and with only a few in the upper part at the height of six feet above the river two gigantic skeletons of the mastodon andium were here embedded their bones were scattered a few feet apart but many of them still held their proper relative positions they were much decayed and as soft as cheese so that even one of the great molar teeth fell into pieces in my hand we here see that the pampean deposit contains mammiferous remains close to its base on the banks of the carcarana a few miles distant the lowest bed visible was pale pampean mud with masses of toscarock in one of which i found a much decayed tooth of the mastodon above this bed there was a thin layer almost composed of small concretions of white tosca out of which i extracted a well preserved but slightly broken tooth of toxodon platensis above this there was an unusual bed of very soft impure sandstone in this neighbourhood i noticed many single embedded bones and i heard of others having been found in so perfect a state that they were long used as gateposts the jesuit falkner found here the dermal armour of some gigantic edental quadruped in some of the red mud scraped from a tooth of one of the mastodons at gorodona professor ehrenberg finds seven polygastrica and thirteen phytolitharia all of them i believe with two exceptions already known species of these twenty the preponderating number are of freshwater origin only two species of coscinodiscus and a spongolithis show the direct influence of the sea therefore professor ehrenberg arrives at the important conclusion that the deposit must have been of brackishwater origin of the thirteen phytolitharia nine are met with in the two deposits in bahia blanca where there is evidence from two other species of polygastrica that the beds were accumulated in brackish water the traces of corals sponges and polythalamia found by dr carpenter in the toscarock of which i must observe the greater number of specimens were from the upper beds in the southern parts of the formation apparently show a more purely marine origin at st fé bajada in entre rios the cliffs estimated at between sixty and seventy feet in height expose an interesting section the lower half consists of tertiary strata with marine shells and the upper half of the pampean formation the lowest bed is an obliquely laminated blackish indurated mud with distinct traces of vegetable remains above this there is a thick bed of yellowish sandy clay with much crystallised gypsum and many shells of ostreæ pectens and arcæ above this there generally comes an arenaceous crystalline limestone but there is sometimes interposed a bed about twelve feet thick of dark green soapy clay weathering into small angular fragments the limestone where purest is white highly crystalline and full of cavities it includes small pebbles of quartz broken shells teeth of sharks and sometimes as i was informed large bones it often contains so much sand as to pass into a calcareous sandstone and in such parts the great ostrea patagonica chiefly abounds in the upper part the limestone alternates with layers of fine white sand the shells included in these beds have been named for me by m dorbigny these species are all extinct the six first were found by m dorbigny and myself in the formations of the rio negro s josef and other parts of patagonia and therefore as first observed by m dorbigny these beds certainly belong to the great patagonian formation which will be described in the ensuing chapter and which we shall see must be considered as a very ancient tertiary one north of the bajada m dorbigny found in beds which he considers as lying beneath the strata here described remains of a toxodon which he has named as a distinct species from the t platensis of the pampean formation much silicified wood is found on the banks of the parana and likewise on the uruguay and i was informed that they come out of these lower beds four specimens collected by myself are dicotyledonous the upper half of the cliff to a thickness of about thirty feet consists of pampean mud of which the lower part is pale coloured and the upper part of a brighter red with some irregular layers of an arenaceous variety of tosca and a few small concretions of the ordinary kind close above the marine limestone there is a thin stratum with a concretionary outline of white hard toscarock or marl which may be considered either as the uppermost bed of the inferior deposits or the lowest of the pampean formation at one time i considered this bed as marking a passage between the two formations but i have since become convinced that i was deceived on this point in the section on the parana i did not find any mammiferous remains but at two miles distance on the a tapas a tributary of the conchitas they were extremely numerous in a low cliff of red pampean mud with small concretions precisely like the upper bed on the parana most of the bones were solitary and much decayed but i saw the dermal armour of a gigantic edental quadruped forming a cauldronlike hollow four or five feet in diameter out of which as i was informed the almost entire skeleton had been lately removed i found single teeth of the mastodon andium toxodon platensis and equus curvidens near to each other as this latter tooth approaches closely to that of the common horse i paid particular attention to its true embedment for i did not at that time know that there was a similar tooth hidden in the matrix with the other mammiferous remains from punta alta it is an interesting circumstance that prof owen finds that the teeth of this horse approach more closely in their peculiar curvature to a fossil specimen brought by mr lyell from north america than to those of any other species of equus the underlying marine tertiary strata exend over a wide area i was assured that they can be traced in ravines in an east and west line across entre rios to the uruguay a distance of about miles in a se direction i heard of their existence at the head of the r nankay and at p gorda in banda oriental a distance of miles i found the same limestone containing the same fossil shells lying at about the same level above the river as at st fé in a southerly direction these beds sink in height for at another p gorda in entre rios the limestone is seen at a much less height and there can be little doubt that the yellowish sandy clay on a level with the river between the carcarana and s nicolas belongs to this same formation as perhaps do the beds of sand at buenos ayres which lie at the bottom of the pampean formation about sixty feet beneath the surface of the plata the southerly declination of these beds may perhaps be due not to unequal elevation but to the original form of the bottom of the sea sloping from land situated to the north for that land existed at no great distance we have evidence in the vegetable remains in the lowest bed at st fé and in the silicified wood and in the bones of toxodon paranensis found according to m dorbigny in still lower strata banda orientalthis province lies on the northern side of the plata and eastward of the uruguay it has a gently undulatory surface with a basis of primary rocks and is in most parts covered up with an unstratified mass of no great thickness of reddish pampean mud in the eastern half near maldonado this deposit is more arenaceous than in the pampas it contains many though small concretions of marl or toscarock and others of highly ferruginous sandstone in one section only a few yards in depth it rested on stratified sand near monte video this deposit in some spots appears to be of greater thickness and the remains of the glyptodon and other extinct mammifers have been found in it in the long line of cliffs between fifty and sixty feet in height called the barrancas de s gregorio which extend westward of the rio s lucia the lower half is formed of coarse sand of quartz and feldspar without mica like that now cast up on the beach near maldonado and the upper half of pampean mud varying in colour and containing honeycombed veins of soft calcareous matter and small concretions of toscarock arranged in lines and likewise a few pebbles of quartz this deposit fills up hollows and furrows in the underlying sand appearing as if water charged with mud had invaded a sandy beach these cliffs extend far westward and at a distance of sixty miles near colonia del sacramiento i found the pampean deposit resting in some places on this sand and in others on the primary rocks between the sand and the reddish mud there appeared to be interposed but the section was not a very good one a thin bed of shells of an existing mytilus still partially retaining their colour the pampean formation in banda oriental might readily be mistaken for an alluvial deposit compared with that of the pampas it is often more sandy and contains small fragments of quartz the concretions are much smaller and there are no extensive masses of toscarock in the extreme western parts of this province between the uruguay and a line drawn from colonia to the r perdido a tributary of the r negro the formations are far more complicated besides primary rocks we meet with extensive tracts and many flattopped horizontally stratified cliffbounded isolated hills of tertiary strata varying extraordinarily in mineralogical nature some identical with the old marine beds of st fé bajada and some with those of the much more recent pampean formation there are also extensive low tracts of country covered with a deposit containing mammiferous remains precisely like that just described in the more eastern parts of the province although from the smooth and unbroken state of the country i never obtained a section of this latter deposit close to the foot of the higher tertiary hills yet i have not the least doubt that it is of quite subsequent origin having been deposited after the sea had worn the tertiary strata into the cliffbounded hills this later formation which is certainly the equivalent of that of the pampas is well seen in the valleys in the estancia of berquelo near mercedes it here consists of reddish earth full of rounded grains of quartz and with some small concretions of toscarock arranged in horizontal lines so as perfectly to resemble except in containing a little calcareous matter the formation in the eastern parts of banda oriental in entre rios and at other places in this estancia the skeleton of a great edental quadruped was found in the valley of the sarandis at the distance of only a few miles this deposit has a somewhat different character being whiter softer finergrained and full of little cavities and consequently of little specific gravity nor does it contain any concretions or calcareous matter i here procured a head which when first discovered must have been quite perfect of the toxodon platensis another of a mylodon perhaps m darwinii and a large piece of dermal armour differing from that of the glyptodon clavipes these bones are remarkable from their extraordinarily fresh appearance when held over a lamp of spirits of wine they give out a strong odour and burn with a small flame mr t reeks has been so kind as to analyse some of the fragments and he finds that they contain about seven per cent of animal matter and eight per cent of water the older tertiary strata forming the higher isolated bills and extensive tracts of country vary as i have said extraordinarily in composition within the distance of a few miles i sometimes passed over crystalline limestone with agate caleareous tuffs and marly rocks all passing into each otherred and pale mud with concretions of toscarock quite like the pampean formationcalcareous conglomerates and sandstonesbright red sandstones passing either into red conglomerate or into white sandstoneshard siliceous sandstones jaspery and chalcedonic rocks and numerous other subordinate varieties i was unable to make out the relations of all these strata and will describe only a few distinct sectionsin the cliffs between p gorda on the uruguay and the a de vivoras the upper bed is crystalline cellular limestone often passing into calcareous sandstone with impressions of some of the same shells as at st fé bajada at p gorda this limestone is interstratified with and rests on white sand which covers a bed about thirty feet thick of palecoloured clay with many shells of the great ostrea patagonica beneath this in the vertical cliff nearly on a level with the river there is a bed of red mud absolutely like the pampean deposit with numerous often large concretions of perfectly characterised white compact toscarock at the mouth of the vivoras the river flows over a pale cavernous toscarock quite like that in the pampas and this appeared to underlie the crystalline limestone but the section was not unequivocal like that at p gorda these beds now form only a narrow and much denuded strip of land but they must once have extended much farther for on the next stream south of the s juan captain sulivan rn found a little cliff only just above the surface of the river with numerous shells of the venus munsterii dorbigone of the species occurring at st fé and of which there are casts at p gorda the line of cliffs of the subsequently deposited true pampean mud extend from colonia to within half a mile of this spot and no doubt once covered up this denuded marine stratum again at colonia a frenchman found in digging the foundations of a house a great mass of the ostrea patagonica of which i saw many fragments packed together just beneath the surface and directly superimposed on the gneiss these sections are important m dorbigny is unwilling to believe that beds of the same nature with the pampean formation ever underlie the ancient marine tertiary strata and i was as much surprised at it as he could have been but the vertical cliff at p gorda allowed of no mistake and i must be permitted to affirm that after having examined the country from the colorada to st fé bajada i could not be deceived in the mineralogical character of the pampean deposit moreover in a precipitons part of the ravine of las boeas a red sandstone is distinetly seen to overlie a thick bed of pale mud also quite like the pampean formation abounding with concretions of true tosearock this sandstone extends over many miles of country it is as red as the brightest volcanic scoriæ it sometimes passes into a coarse red conglomerate composed of the underlying primary rocks and often passes into a soft white sandstone with red streaks at the calera de los huerfanos only a quarter of a mile south of where i first met with the red sandstone the crystalline white limestone is quarried as this bed is the uppermost and as it often passes into calcareous sandstone interstratified with pure sand and as the red sandstone likewise passes into soft white sandstone and is also the uppermost bed i believe that these two beds though so different are equivalents a few leagues southward of these two places on each side of the low primary range of s juan there are some flattopped cliffbounded separate little hills very similar to those fringing the primary ranges in the great plain south of buenos ayres they are composedst of calcareous tuff with many particles of quartz sometimes passing into a coarse conglomerate nd of a stone undistinguishable on the closest inspection from the compacter varieties of toscarock and rd of semicrystalline limestone including nodules of agate these three varieties pass insensibly into each other and as they form the uppermost stratum in this district i believe that they also are the equivalents of the pure crystalline limestone and of the red and white sandstones and conglomerates between these points and mercedes on the rio negro there are scarcely any good sections the road passing over limestone toscarock calcareous and bright red sandstones and near the source of the s salvador over a wide extent of jaspery rocks with much milky agate like that in the limestone near s juan in the estancia of berquelo the separate flattopped cliffbounded hills are rather higher than in other parts of the country they range in a ne and sw direction their uppermost beds consist of the same bright red sandstone passing sometimes into a conglomerate and in the lower part into soft white sandstone and even into loose sand beneath this sandstone i saw in two places layers of calcareous and marly rocks and in one place red pampeanlike earth at the base of these sections there was a hard stratified white sandstone with chalcedonic layers near mercedes beds of the same nature and apparently of the same age are associated with compact white crystalline limestone including much botryoidal agate and singular masses like porcelain but really composed of a calcareosiliceous paste in sinking wells in this district the chalcedonic strata seems to be the lowest beds such as here described occur over the whole of this neighbourhood but twenty miles further up the r negro in the cliffs of perika which are about fifty feet in height the upper bed is a prettily variegated chalcedony mingled with a pure white tallowy limestone beneath this there is a conglomerate of quartz and granite beneath this many sandstones some highly calcareous and the whole lower twothirds of the cliff consist of earthy calcareous beds of various degrees of purity with one layer of reddish pampeanlike mud when examining the agates the chalcedonic and jaspery rocks some of the limestones and even the bright red sandstones i was forcibly struck with their resemblance to deposits formed in the neighbourhood of volcanic action i now find that m isabelle in his voyage à buenos ayres has described closely similar beds on itaquy and ibicuy which enter the uruguay some way north of the r negro and these beds include fragments of red decomposed true scoriæ hardened by zeolite and of black retinite we have then here good evidence of volcanic action during our tertiary period still farther north near s annawhere the parana makes a remarkable bend m bonpland found some singular amygdaloidal rocks which perhaps may belong to this same epoch i may remark that judging from the size and wellrounded condition of the blocks of rock in the abovedescribed conglomerates masses of primary formation probably existed at this tertiary period above water there is also according to m isabelle much conglomerate farther north at salto from whatever source and through whatever means the great pampean formation originated we here have i must repeat unequivocal evidence of a similar action at a period before that of the deposition of the marine tertiary strata with extinct shells at st fé and p gorda during also the deposition of these strata we have in the intercalated layers of red pampeanlike mud and toscarock and in the passage near s juan of the semicrystalline limestones with agate into tosca undistinguishable from that of the pampas evidence of the same action though continued only at intervals and in a feeble manner we have further seen that in this district at a period not only subsequent to the deposition of the tertiary strata but to their upheavement and most extensive denudation true pampean mud with its usual characters and including mammiferous remains were deposited round and between the hills or islets formed of these tertiary strata and over the whole eastern and low primary districts of banda oriental earthy mass with extinct mammiferous remains over the porphyritic gravel at s julian lat s in patagoniathis case though not coming strictly under the pampean formation may be conveniently given here on the south side of the harbour there is a nearly level plain mentioned in the eighth chapter about seven miles long and three or four miles wide estimated at ninety feet in height and bordered by perpendicular cliffs of which a section is here represented the lower old tertiary strata to be described in the next chapter are covered by the usual gravel bed and this by an irregular earthy sometimes sandy mass seldom more than two or three feet in thickness except where it fills up furrows or gullies worn not only through the underlying gravel but even through the upper tertiary beds this earthy mass is of a pale reddish colour like the less pure varieties of pampean mud in banda oriental it includes small calcareous concretions like those of toscarock but more arenaceous and other concretions of a greenish indurated argillaceous substance a few pebbles also from the underlying gravelbed are also included in it and these being occasionally arranged in horizontal lines show that the mass is of subaqueous origin on the surface and embedded in the superficial parts there are numerous shells partially retaining their colours of three or four of the now commonest littoral species near the bottom of one deep furrow represented in the diagram filled up with this earthy deposit i found a large part of the skeleton of the macrauchenia patachonicaa gigantic and most extraordinary pachyderm allied according to professor owen to the palæotherium but with affinities to the ruminants especially to the american division of the camelidæ several of the vertebræ in a chain and nearly all the bones of one of the limbs even to the smallest bones of the foot were embedded in their proper relative positions hence the skeleton was certainly united by its flesh or ligaments when enveloped in the mud this earthy mass with its concretions and mammiferous remains filling up furrows in the underlying gravel certainly presents a very striking resemblance to some of the sections for instance at p alta in b blanca or at the barrancas de s gregorio in the pampean formation but i must believe that this resemblance is only accidental i suspect that the mud which at the present day is accumulating in deep and narrow gullies at the head of the harbour would after elevation present a very similar appearance the southernmost part of the true pampean formation namely on the colorado lies miles of latitude north of this point with respect to the age of the macrauchenia the shells on the surface prove that the mass in which the skeleton was enveloped has been elevated above the sea within the recent period i did not see any of the shells embedded at a sufficient depth to assure me though it be highly probable that the whole thickness of the mass was contemporaneous with these individual specimens that the macrauchenia lived subsequently to the spreading out of the gravel on this plain is certain and that this gravel at the height of ninety feet was spread out long after the existence of recent shells is scarcely less certain for it was shown in the eighth chapter that this line of coast has been upheaved with remarkable equability and that over a vast space both north and south of s julian recent species of shells are strewed on or embedded in the surface of the feet plain and of the feet plain up to a height of feet these wide stepformed plains have been formed by the denuding action of the coastwaves on the old tertiary strata and therefore when the surface of the feet plain with the shells on it first rose above the level of the sea the feet plain did not exist and its formation as well as the spreading out of the gravel on its summit must have taken place subsequently so also the denudation and the gravelcovering of the ninety feet plain must have taken place subsequently to the elevation of the feet plain on which recent shells are also strewed hence there cannot be any doubt that the macrauchenia which certainly was entombed in a fresh state and which must have been alive after the spreading out of the gravel on the ninety feet plain existed not only subsequently to the upraised shells on the surface of the feet plain but also to those on the to feet plain these shells eight in number namely three species of mytilus two of patella one fusus voluta and balanus are undoubtedly recent species and are the commonest kinds now living on this coast at punta alta in b blanca i remarked how marvellous it was that the toxodon a mammifer so unlike to all known genera should have coexisted with twentythree still living marine animals and now we find that the macrauchenia a quadruped only a little less anomalous than the toxodon also coexisted with eight other still existing mollusca it should moreover be borne in mind that a tooth of a pachydermatous animal was found with the other remains at punta alta which professor owen thinks almost certainly belonged to the macrauchenia mr lyell has arrived at a highly important conclusion with respect to the age of the north american extinct mammifers many of which are closely allied to and even identical with those of the pampean formation namely that they lived subsequently to the period when erratic boulders were transported by the agency of floating ice in temperate latitudes now in the valley of the san cruz only fifty miles of latitude south of the spot where the macrauehenia was entombed vast numbers of gigantic angular boulders which must have been transported from the cordillera on icebergs lie strewed on the plain at the height of feet above the level of the sea in ascending to this level several stepformed plains must be crossed all of which have necessarily required long time for their formation hence the lowest or ninety feet plain with its superficial bed containing the remains of the macrauchenia must have been formed very long subsequently to the period when the feet plain was beneath the sea and boulders were dropped on it from floating masses of ice mr lyells conclusion therefore is thus far confirmed in the southern hemisphere and it is the more important as one is naturally tempted to admit so simple an explanation that it was the iceperiod that caused the extinction of the numerous great mammifers which so lately swarmed over the two americas summary and concluding remarks on the pampean formationone of its most striking features is its great extent i passed continuously over it from the colorado to st fé bajada a distance of geographical miles and m dorbigny traced it for miles farther north in the latitude of the plata i examined this formation at intervals over an east and west line of miles from maldonado to the river carcarana and m dorbigny believes it extends miles farther inland from mr caldcleughs travels however i should have thought that it had extended south of the cordovese range to near mendoza and i may add that i heard of great bones having been found high up the river quinto hence the area of the pampean formation as remarked by m dorbigny is probably at least equal to that of france and perhaps twice or thrice as great in a basin surrounded by gravelcliff at a height of nearly feet south of mendoza there is as described in the tenth chapter a deposit very like the pampean interstratified with other matter and again at s julians in patagonia miles south of the colorado a small irregular bed of a nearly similar nature contains as we have just seen mammiferous remains in the provinces of moxos and chiquitos miles northward of the pampas and in bolivia at a height of mètres m dorbigny has described similar deposits which he believes to have been formed by the same agency contemporaneously with the pampean formation considering the immense distances between these several points and their different heights it appears to me infinitely more probable that this similarity has resulted not from contemporancousness of origin but from the similarity of the rocky framework of the continent it is known that in brazil an immense area consists of gneissic rocks and we shall hereafter see over how great a length the plutonic rocks of the cordillera the overlying purple porphyries and the trachytic ejections are almost identical in nature three theories on the origin of the pampean formation have been propoundedfirst that of a great debacle by m dorbigny this seems founded chiefly on the absence of stratification and on the number of embedded remains of terrestrial quadrupeds although the pampean formation like so many argillaceous deposits is not divided into distinct and separate strata yet we have seen that in one good section it was striped with horizontal zones of colour and that in several specified places the upper and lower parts differed not only considerably in colour but greatly in constitution in the southern part of the pampas the upper mass to a certain extent stratified generally consists of hard toscarock and the lower part of red pampean mud often itself divided into two or more masses varying in colour and in the quantity of included calcareous matter in western banda oriental beds of a similar nature but of a greater age conformably underlie and are intercalated with the regularly stratified tertiary formation as a general rule the marly concretions are arranged in horizontal lines sometimes united into irregular strata surely if the mud had been tumultuously deposited in mass the included calcareous matter would have segregated itself irregularly and not into nodules arranged in horizontal lines one above the other and often far apart this arrangement appears to me to prove that mud differing slightly in composition was successively and quietly deposited on the theory of a debacle a prodigious amount of mud without a single pebble is supposed to have been borne over the wide surface of the pampas when under water on the other hand over the whole of patagonia the same or another debacle is supposed to have borne nothing but gravelthe gravel and the fine mud in the neighbourhood of the rios negro and colorado having been borne to an equal distance from the cordillera or imagined line of disturbance assuredly directly opposite effects ought not to be attributed to the same agency where again could a mass of fine sediment charged with calcareous matter in a fit state for chemical segregation and in quantity sufficient to cover an area at least miles long and miles broad to a depth of from twenty or thirty feet to a hundred feet have been accumulated ready to be transported by the supposed debacle to my mind it is little short of demonstration that a great lapse of time was necessary for the production and deposition of the enormous amount of mudlike matter forming the pampas nor should i have noticed the theory of a debacle had it not been adduced by a naturalist so eminent as m dorbigny a second theory first suggested i believe by sir w parish is that the pampean formation was thrown down on low and marshy plains by the rivers of this country before they assumed their present courses the appearance and composition of the deposit the manner in which it slopes up and round the primary ranges the nature of the underlying marine beds the estuary and seashells on the surface the overlying sandstone beds at m hermoso are all quite opposed to this view nor do i believe that there is a single instance of a skeleton of one of the extinct mammifers having been found in an upright position as if it had been mired the third theory of the truth of which i cannot entertain the smallest doubt is that the pampean formation was slowly accumulated at the mouth of the former estuary of the plata and in the sea adjoining it i have come to this conclusion from the reasons assigned against the two foregoing theories and from simple geographical considerations from the numerous shells of the azara labiata lying loose on the surface of the plains and near buenos ayres embedded in the toscarock we know that this formation not only was formerly covered by but that the uppermost parts were deposited in the brackish water of the ancient la plata southward and seaward of buenos ayres the plains were upheaved from under water inhabited by true marine shells we further know from professor ehrenbergs examination of the twenty microscopical organisms in the mud round the tooth of the mastodon high up the course of the parana that the bottommost part of this formation was of brackishwater origin a similar conclusion must be extended to the beds of like composition at the level of the sea and under it at m hermoso in bahia blanca dr carpenter finds that the harder varieties of toscarock collected chiefly to the south contain marine spongoid bodies minute fragments of shells corals and polythalamia these perhaps may have been drifted inwards by the tides from the more open parts of the sea the absence of shells throughout this deposit with the exception of the uppermost layers near buenos ayres is a remarkable fact can it be explained by the brackish condition of the water or by the deep mud at the bottom i have stated that both the reddish mud and the concretions of toscarock are often penetrated by minute linear cavities such as frequently may be observed in freshwater calcareous depositswere they produced by the burrowing of small worms only on this view of the pampean formation having been of estuary origin can the extraordinary numbers presently to be alluded to of the embedded mammiferous remains be explained with respect to the first origin of the reddish mud i will only remark that the enormous area of brazil consists in chief part of gneissic and other granitic rocks which have suffered decomposition and been converted into a red gritty argillaceous mass to a greater depth than in any other country which i have seen the mixture of rounded grains and even of small fragments and pebbles of quartz in the pampean mud of banda oriental is evidently due to the neighbouring and underlying primary rocks the estuary mud was drifted during the pampean period in a much more southerly source owing probably to the east and west primary ridges south of the plata not having been then elevated than the mud of the plata at present is for it was formerly deposited as far south as the colorado the quantity of calcareous matter in this formation especially in those large districts where the whole mass passes into toscarock is very great i have already remarked on the close resemblance in external and microscopical appearance between this toscarock and the strata at coquimbo which have certainly resulted from the decay and attrition of recent shells i dare not however extend this conclusion to the calcareous rocks of the pampas more especially as the underlying tertiary strata in western banda oriental show that at that period there was a copious emission of carbonate of lime in connection with volcanic action the pampean formation judging from its similar composition and from the apparent absolute specific identity of some of its mammiferous remains and from the generic resemblance of others belongs over its vast areathroughout banda oriental entre rios and the wide extent of the pampas as far south as the coloradoto the same geological epoch the mammiferous remains occur at all depths from the top to the bottom of the deposit and i may add that nowhere in the pampas is there any appearance of much superficial denudation some bones which i found near the guardia del monte were embedded close to the surface and this appears to have been the case with many of those discovered in banda oriental on the matanzas twenty miles south of buenos ayres a glyptodon was embedded five feet beneath the surface numerous remains were found by s muniz near luxan at an average depth of eighteen feet in buenos ayres a skeleton was disinterred at sixty feet depth and on the parana i have described two skeletons of the mastodon only five or six feet above the very base of the deposit with respect to the age of this formation as judged of by the ordinary standard of the existence of mollusca the only evidence within the limits of the true pampas which is at all trustworthy is afforded by the still living azara labiata being embedded in toscarock near buenos ayres at punta alta however we have seen that several of the extinct mammifers most characteristic of the pampean formation coexisted with twenty species of mollusca a barnacle and two corals all still living on this same coastfor when we remember that the shells have a more ancient appearance than the bones that many of the bones though embedded in a coarse conglomerate are perfectly preserved that almost all the parts of the skeleton of the scelidotherium even to the kneecap were lying in their proper relative positions and that a large piece of the fragile dermal armour of a dasypoid quadruped connected with some of the bones of the foot had been entombed in a condition allowing the two sides to be doubled together it must assuredly be admitted that these mammiferous remains were embedded in a fresh state and therefore that the living animals coexisted with the coembedded shells moreover the macrauchenia patachonica of which according to professor owen remains also occur in the pampas of buenos ayres and at punta alta has been shown by satisfactory evidence of another kind to have lived on the plains of patagonia long after the period when the adjoining sea was first tenanted by its present commonest molluscous animals we must therefore conclude that the pampean formation belongs in the ordinary geological sense of the word to the recent period at st fé bajada the pampean estuary formation with its mammiferous remains conformably overlies the marine tertiary strata which as first shown by m dorbigny are contemporaneous with those of patagonia and which as we shall hereafter see belong to a very ancient tertiary stage when examining the junction between these two formations i thought that the concretionary layer of marl marked a passage between the marine and estuary stages m dorbigny disputes this view as given in my journal and i admit that it is erroneous though in some degree excusable from their conformability and from both abounding with calcareous matter it would indeed have been a great anomaly if there had been a true passage between a deposit contemporaneous with existing species of mollusea and one in which all the mollusea appear to be extinct northward of st fé m dorbigny met with ferruginous sandstones marly rocks and other beds which he considers as a distinct and lower formation but the evidence that they are not parts of the same with an altered mineralogical character does not appear to me quite satisfactory in western banda oriental whilst the marine tertiary strata were accumulating there were volcanic eruptions much silex and lime were precipitated from solution coarse conglomerates were formed being derived probably from adjoining land and layers of red mud and marly rocks like those of the pampean formation were occasionally deposited the true pampean deposit with mammiferous remains instead of as at st fé overlying conformably the tertiary strata is here seen at a lower level folding round and between the flattopped cliffbounded hills formed by the upheaval and denudation of these same tertiary strata the upheaval having occurred here earlier than at st fé may be naturally accounted for by the contemporaneous volcanic action at the barrancas de s gregorio the pampean deposit as we have seen overlies and fills up furrows in coarse sand precisely like that now accumulating on the shores near the mouth of the plata i can hardly believe that this loose and coarse sand is contemporaneous with the old tertiary and often crystalline strata of the more western parts of the province and am induced to suspect that it is of subsequent origin if that section near colonia could be implicitly trusted in which at a height of only fifteen feet above the plata a bed of freshlooking mussels of an existing littoral species appeared to lie between the sand and the pampean mud i should conclude that banda oriental must have stood when the coarse sand was accumulating at only a little below its present level and had then subsided allowing the estuary pampean mud to cover far and wide its surface up to a height of some hundred feet and that after this subsidence the province had been uplifted to its present level in western banda oriental we know from two unequivocal sections that there is a mass absolutely undistinguishable from the true pampean deposit beneath the old tertiary strata this inferior mass must be very much more ancient than the upper deposit with its mammiferous remains for it lies beneath the tertiary strata in which all the shells are extinct nevertheless the lower and upper masses as well as some intermediate layers are so similar in mineralogical character that i cannot doubt that they are all of estuary origin and have been derived from the same great source at first it appeared to me extremely improbable that mud of the same nature should have been deposited on nearly the same spot during an immense lapse of time namely from a period equivalent perhaps to the eocene of europe to that of the pampean formation but as at the very commencement of the pampean period if not at a still earlier period the sierra ventana formed a boundary to the souththe cordillera or the plains in front of them to the westthe whole province of corrientes probably to the north for according to m dorbigny it is not covered by the pampean depositand brazil as known by the remains in the caves to the northeast and as again during the older tertiary period land already existed in western banda oriental and near st fé bajada as may be inferred from the vegetable débris from the quantities of silicified wood and from the remains of a toxodon found according to m dorbigny in still lower strata we may conclude that at this ancient period a great expanse of water was surrounded by the same rocky framework which now bounds the plains of pampean formation this having been the case the circumstance of sediment of the same nature having been deposited in the same area during an immense lapse of time though highly remarkable does not appear incredible the elevation of the pampas at least of the southern parts has been slow and interrupted by several periods of rest as may be inferred from the plains cliffs and lines of sanddunes with shells and pumicepebbles standing at different heights i believe also that the pampean mud continued to be deposited after parts of this formation had already been elevated in the same manner as mud would continue to be deposited in the estuary of the plata if the mudbanks on its shores were now uplifted and changed into plains i believe in this from the improbability of so many skeletons and bones having been accumulated at one spot where m hermoso now stands at a depth of between and feet and at a vast distance from any land except small rocky isletsas must have been the case if the high toscaplain round the ventana and adjoining sierras had not been already uplifted and converted into land supporting mammiferous animals at punta alta we have good evidence that the gravelstrata which certainly belong to the true pampean period were accumulated after the elevation in that neighbourhood of the main part of the pampean deposit whence the rounded masses of toscarock were derived and that rolled fragment of black bone in the same peculiar condition with the remains at monte hermoso the number of the mammiferous remains embedded in the pampas is as i have remarked wonderful it should be borne in mind that they have almost exclusively been found
