of the great island of new zealand but i suspect that this exception if the information be correct may be explained through glacial agency this general absence of frogs toads and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals for frogs have been introduced into madeira the azores and mauritius and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance but as these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by seawater on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island but why on the theory of creation they should not have been created there it would be very difficult to explain mammals offer another and similar case i have carefully searched the oldest voyages but have not finished my search as yet i have not found a single instance free from doubt of a terrestrial mammal excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives inhabiting an island situated above miles from a continent or great continental island and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren the falkland islands which are inhabited by a wolflike fox come nearest to an exception but this group cannot be considered as oceanic as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland moreover icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores and they may have formerly transported foxes as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands if close to a continent and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied it cannot be said on the ordinary view of creation that there has not been time for the creation of mammals many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes and on continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands aërial mammals do occur on almost every island new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world norfolk island the viti archipelago the bonin islands the caroline and marianne archipelagoes and mauritius all possess their peculiar bats why it may be asked has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands on my view this question can easily be answered for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea but bats can fly across bats have been seen wandering by day far over the atlantic ocean and two north american species either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda at the distance of miles from the mainland i hear from mr tomes who has specially studied this family that many of the same species have enormous ranges and are found on continents and on far distant islands hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands with the absence of all terrestrial mammals besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of islands from continents there is also a relation to a certain extent independent of distance between the depth of the sea separating an island from the neighbouring mainland and the presence in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified condition mr windsor earl has made some striking observations on this head in regard to the great malay archipelago which is traversed near celebes by a space of deep ocean and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas on either side the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks and they are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds no doubt some few anomalies occur in this great archipelago and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through mans agency but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of mr wallace i have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all other quarters of the world but as far as i have gone the relation generally holds good we see britain separated by a shallow channel from europe and the mammals are the same on both sides we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar channels from australia the west indian islands stand on a deeply submerged bank nearly fathoms in depth and here we find american forms but the species and even the genera are distinct as the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continentan inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation all the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islandsnamely the scarcity of kindsthe richness in endemic forms in particular classes or sections of classesthe absence of whole groups as of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of aërial batsthe singular proportions of certain orders of plantsherbaceous forms having been developed into trees cseem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time than with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest continent for on this latter view the migration would probably have been more complete and if modification be admitted all the forms of life would have been more equally modified in accordance with the paramount importance of the relation of organism to organism i do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival could have reached their present homes but the probability of many islands having existed as haltingplaces of which not a wreck now remains must not be overlooked i will here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty almost all oceanic islands even the most isolated and smallest are inhabited by landshells generally by endemic species but sometimes by species found elsewhere dr aug a gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the landshells of the islands of the pacific now it is notorious that landshells are very easily killed by salt their eggs at least such as i have tried sink in seawater and are killed by it yet there must be on my view some unknown but highly efficient means for their transportal would the justhatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground and thus get transported it occurred to me that landshells when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea and i found that several species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in seawater during seven days one of these shells was the helix pomatia and after it had again hybernated i put it in seawater for twenty days and it perfectly recovered as this species has a thick calcareous operculum i removed it and when it had formed a new membranous one i immersed it for fourteen days in seawater and it recovered and crawled away but more experiments are wanted on this head the most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland without being actually the same species numerous instances could be given of this fact i will give only one that of the galapagos archipelago situated under the equator between and miles from the shores of south america here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the american continent there are twentysix land birds and twentyfive of these are ranked by mr gould as distinct species supposed to have been created here yet the close affinity of most of these birds to american species in every character in their habits gestures and tones of voice was manifest so it is with the other animals and with nearly all the plants as shown by dr hooker in his admirable memoir on the flora of this archipelago the naturalist looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the pacific distant several hundred miles from the continent yet feels that he is standing on american land why should this be so why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the galapagos archipelago and nowhere else bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in america there is nothing in the conditions of life in the geological nature of the islands in their height or climate or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together which resembles closely the conditions of the south american coast in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects on the other hand there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil in climate height and size of the islands between the galapagos and cape de verde archipelagos but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants the inhabitants of the cape de verde islands are related to those of africa like those of the galapagos to america i believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation whereas on the view here maintained it is obvious that the galapagos islands would be likely to receive colonists whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land from america and the cape de verde islands from africa and that such colonists would be liable to modificationthe principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace many analogous facts could be given indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent or of other near islands the exceptions are few and most of them can be explained thus the plants of kerguelen land though standing nearer to africa than to america are related and that very closely as we know from dr hookers account to those of america but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs drifted by the prevailing currents this anomaly disappears new zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to australia the nearest mainland than to any other region and this is what might have been expected but it is also plainly related to south america which although the next nearest continent is so enormously remote that the fact becomes an anomaly but this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both new zealand south america and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point namely from the antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation before the commencement of the glacial period the affinity which though feeble i am assured by dr hooker is real between the flora of the southwestern corner of australia and of the cape of good hope is a far more remarkable case and is at present inexplicable but this affinity is confined to the plants and will i do not doubt be some day explained the law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent we sometimes see displayed on a small scale yet in a most interesting manner within the limits of the same archipelago thus the several islands of the galapagos archipelago are tenanted as i have elsewhere shown in a quite marvellous manner by very closely related species so that the inhabitants of each separate island though mostly distinct are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world and this is just what might have been expected on my view for the islands are situated so near each other that they would almost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source or from each other but this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be used as an argument against my views for it may be asked how has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other having the same geological nature the same height climate c that many of the immigrants should have been differently modified though only in a small degree this long appeared to me a great difficulty but it arises in chief part from the deeplyseated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants whereas it cannot i think be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants with which each has to compete is at least as important and generally a far more important element of success now if we look to those inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which are found in other parts of the world laying on one side for the moment the endemic species which cannot be here fairly included as we are considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival we find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands this difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means of transporta seed for instance of one plant having been brought to one island and that of another plant to another island hence when in former times an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands or when it subsequently spread from one island to another it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms a plant for instance would find the bestfitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another and it would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies if then it varied natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands some species however might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same the really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances is that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands but the islands though in sight of each other are separated by deep arms of the sea in most cases wider than the british channel and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united the currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map nevertheless a good many species both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago are common to the several islands and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others but we often take i think an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each others territory when put into free intercommunication undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time being familiar with the fact that many species naturalised through mans agency have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants but are very distinct species belonging in a large proportion of cases as shown by alph de candolle to distinct genera in the galapagos archipelago many even of the birds though so well adapted for flying from island to island are distinct on each thus there are three closelyallied species of mockingthrush each confined to its own island now let us suppose the mockingthrush of chatham island to be blown to charles island which has its own mockingthrush why should it succeed in establishing itself there we may safely infer that charles island is well stocked with its own species for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared and we may infer that the mockingthrush peculiar to charles island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to chatham island sir c lyell and mr wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject namely that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo possess many distinct but representative landshells some of which live in crevices of stone and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from porto santo to madeira yet this latter island has not become colonised by the porto santo species nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some european landshells which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species from these considerations i think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species which inhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago not having universally spread from island to island in many other instances as in the several districts of the same continent preoccupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life thus the southeast and southwest corners of australia have nearly the same physical conditions and are united by continuous land yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals birds and plants the principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands namely that the inhabitants when not identically the same yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derivedthe colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homesis of the widest application throughout nature we see this on every mountain in every lake and marsh for alpine species excepting in so far as the same forms chiefly of plants have spread widely throughout the world during the recent glacial epoch are related to those of the surrounding lowlandsthus we have in south america alpine hummingbirds alpine rodents alpine plants c all of strictly american forms and it is obvious that a mountain as it became slowly upheaved would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands so it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes excepting in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to the whole world we see this same principle in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of america and of europe other analogous facts could be given and it will i believe be universally found to be true that wherever in two regions let them be ever so distant many closely allied or representative species occur there will likewise be found some identical species showing in accordance with the foregoing view that at some former period there has been intercommunication or migration between the two regions and wherever many closelyallied species occur there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species and some as varieties these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification this relation between the power and extent of migration of a species either at the present time or at some former period under different physical conditions and the existence at remote points of the world of other species allied to it is shown in another and more general way mr gould remarked to me long ago that in those genera of birds which range over the world many of the species have very wide ranges i can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true though it would be difficult to prove it amongst mammals we see it strikingly displayed in bats and in a lesser degree in the felidæ and canidæ we see it if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles so it is with most freshwater productions in which so many genera range over the world and many individual species have enormous ranges it is not meant that in worldranging genera all the species have a wide range or even that they have on an average a wide range but only that some of the species range very widely for the facility with which widelyranging species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their average range for instance two varieties of the same species inhabit america and europe and the species thus has an immense range but if the variation had been a little greater the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct species and the common range would have been greatly reduced still less is it meant that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely as in the case of certain powerfullywinged birds will necessarily range widely for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates but on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single parent though now distributed to the most remote points of the world we ought to find and i believe as a general rule we do find that some at least of the species range very widely for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely undergoing modification during its diffusion and should place itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species in considering the wide distribution of certain genera we should bear in mind that some are extremely ancient and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the world where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions there is also some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character this fact together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation probably accounts for a law which has long been observed and which has lately been admirably discussed by alph de candolle in regard to plants namely that the lower any group of organisms is the more widely it is apt to range the relations just discussednamely low and slowlychanging organisms ranging more widely than the highsome of the species of widelyranging genera themselves ranging widelysuch facts as alpine lacustrine and marsh productions being related with the exceptions before specified to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands though these stations are so differentthe very close relation of the distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelagoand especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainlandare i think utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the nearest and readiest source together with the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes summary of last and present chaptersin these chapters i have endeavoured to show that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of climate and of the level of the land which have certainly occurred within the recent period and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional transporta subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts i think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species wherever located have descended from the same parents are not insuperable and we are led to this conclusion which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation by some general considerations more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of subgenera genera and families with respect to the distinct species of the same genus which on my theory must have spread from one parentsource if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance and remember that some forms of life change most slowly enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration i do not think that the difficulties are insuperable though they often are in this case and in that of the individuals of the same species extremely grave as exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution i have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern glacial period which i am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world or at least great meridional belts as showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport i have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of freshwater productions if the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time the individuals of the same species and likewise of allied species have proceeded from some one source then i think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration generally of the more dominant forms of life together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms we can thus understand the high importance of barriers whether of land or water which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces we can thus understand the localisation of subgenera genera and families and how it is that under different latitudes for instance in south america the inhabitants of the plains and mountains of the forests marshes and deserts are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent bearing in mind that the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest importance we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of life for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new inhabitants entered one region according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either in greater or lesser numbers according or not as those which entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly there would ensue in different regions independently of their physical conditions infinitely diversified conditions of lifethere would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reactionand we should find as we do find some groups of beings greatly and some only slightly modifiedsome developed in great force some existing in scanty numbersin the different great geographical provinces of the world on these same principles we can understand as i have endeavoured to show why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar and why in relation to the means of migration one group of beings even within the same class should have all its species endemic and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world we can see why whole groups of organisms as batrachians and terrestrial mammals should be absent from oceanic islands whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar species of aërial mammals or bats we can see why there should be some relation between the presence of mammals in a more or less modified condition and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland we can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct on the several islets should be closely related to each other and likewise be related but less closely to those of the nearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived we can see why in two areas however distant from each other there should be a correlation in the presence of identical species of varieties of doubtful species and of distinct but representative species as the late edward forbes often insisted there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas we see this in many facts the endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time for the exceptions to the rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent but which occur above and below so in space it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species or by a group of species is continuous and the exceptions which are not rare may as i have attempted to show be accounted for by migration at some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of transport and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts both in time and space species and groups of species have their points of maximum development groups of species belonging either to a certain period of time or to a certain area are often characterised by trifling characters in common as of sculpture or colour in looking to the long succession of ages as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world we find that some organisms differ little whilst others belonging to a different class or to a different order or even only to a different family of the same order differ greatly in both time and space the lower members of each class generally change less than the higher but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule on my theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible for whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary generation and the more nearly any two forms are related in blood the nearer they will generally stand to each other in time and space in both cases the laws of variation have been the same and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural selection chapter xiii mutual affinities of organic beings morphology embryology rudimentary organs classification groups subordinate to groups natural system rules and difficulties in classification explained on the theory of descent with modification classification of varieties descent always used in classification analogical or adaptive characters affinities general complex and radiating extinction separates and defines groups morphology between members of the same class between parts of the same individual embryology laws of explained by variations not supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding age rudimentary organs their origin explained summary from the first dawn of life all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending degrees so that they can be classed in groups under groups this classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations the existence of groups would have been of simple signification if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land and another the water one to feed on flesh another on vegetable matter and so on but the case is widely different in nature for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different habits in our second and fourth chapters on variation and on natural selection i have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging the much diffused and common that is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera which vary most the varieties or incipient species thus produced ultimately become converted as i believe into new and distinct species and these on the principle of inheritance tend to produce other new and dominant species consequently the groups which are now large and which generally include many dominant species tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size i further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge this conclusion was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life which in any small area come into the closest competition and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation i attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character to supplant and exterminate the less divergent the less improved and preceding forms i request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action as formerly explained of these several principles and he will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups in the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species and all the genera on this line form together one class for all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent and consequently have inherited something in common but the three genera on the left hand have on this same principle much in common and form a subfamily distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent these five genera have also much though less in common and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand which diverged at a still earlier period and all these genera descended from a form an order distinct from the genera descended from i so that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera and the genera are included in or subordinate to subfamilies families and orders all united into one class thus the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group which from its familiarity does not always sufficiently strike us is in my judgment fully explained naturalists try to arrange the species genera and families in each class on what is called the natural system but what is meant by this system some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike and for separating those which are most unlike or as an artificial means for enunciating as briefly as possible general propositionsthat is by one sentence to give the characters common for instance to all mammals by another those common to all carnivora by another those common to the doggenus and then by adding a single sentence a full description is given of each kind of dog the ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable but many naturalists think that something more is meant by the natural system they believe that it reveals the plan of the creator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space or what else is meant by the plan of the creator it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge such expressions as that famous one of linnæus and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form that the characters do not make the genus but that the genus gives the characters seem to imply that something more is included in our classification than mere resemblance i believe that something more is included and that propinquity of descentthe only known cause of the similarity of organic beingsis the bond hidden as it is by various degrees of modification which is partially revealed to us by our classifications let us now consider the rules followed in classification and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other it might have been thought and was in ancient times thought that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life and the general place of each being in the economy of nature would be of very high importance in classification nothing can be more false no one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew of a dugong to a whale of a whale to a fish as of any importance these resemblances though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being are ranked as merely adaptive or analogical characters but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur it may even be given as a general rule that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits the more important it becomes for classification as an instance owen in speaking of the dugong says the generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal i have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities we are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character so with plants how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation on which their whole life depends are of little signification excepting in the first main divisions whereas the organs of reproduction with their product the seed are of paramount importance we must not therefore in classifying trust to resemblances in parts of the organisation however important they may be for the welfare of the being in relation to the outer world perhaps from this cause it has partly arisen that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance no doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is generally but by no means always true but their importance for classification i believe depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life that the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value is almost shown by the one fact that in allied groups in which the same organ as we have every reason to suppose has nearly the same physiological value its classificatory value is widely different no naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact and it has been most fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author it will suffice to quote the highest authority robert brown who in speaking of certain organs in the proteaceæ says their generic importance like that of all their parts not only in this but as i apprehend in every natural family is very unequal and in some cases seems to be entirely lost again in another work he says the genera of the connaraceæ differ in having one or more ovaria in the existence or absence of albumen in the imbricate or valvular æstivation any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate cnestis from connarus to give an example amongst insects in one great division of the hymenoptera the antennæ as westwood has remarked are most constant in structure in another division they differ much and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification yet no one probably will say that the antennæ in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings again no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance yet undoubtedly organs in this condition are often of high value in classification no one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants and certain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms robert brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the classification of the grasses numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups for instance whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth the only character according to owen which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptilesthe inflection of the angle of the jaws in marsupialsthe manner in which the wings of insects are foldedmere colour in certain algæmere pubescence on parts of the flower in grassesthe nature of the dermal covering as hair or feathers in the vertebrata if the ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair this external and trifling character would i think have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds and reptiles as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ the importance for classification of trifling characters mainly depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more or less importance the value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history hence as has often been remarked a species may depart from its allies in several characters both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked hence also it has been found that a classification founded on any single character however important that may be has always failed for no part of the organisation is universally constant the importance of an aggregate of characters even when none are important alone explains i think that saying of linnæus that the characters do not give the genus but the genus gives the characters for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance too slight to be defined certain plants belonging to the malpighiaceæ bear perfect and degraded flowers in the latter as a de jussieu has remarked the greater number of the characters proper to the species to the genus to the family to the class disappear and thus laugh at our classification but when aspicarpa produced in france during several years only degraded flowers departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order yet m richard sagaciously saw as jussieu observes that this genus should still be retained amongst the malpighiaceæ this case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded practically when naturalists are at work they do not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species if they find a character nearly uniform and common to a great number of forms and not common to others they use it as one of high value if common to some lesser number they use it as of subordinate value this principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist aug st hilaire if certain characters are always found correlated with others though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them especial value is set on them as in most groups of animals important organs such as those for propelling the blood or for aërating it or those for propagating the race are found nearly uniform they are considered as highly serviceable in classification but in some groups of animals all these the most important vital organs are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value we can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult for our classifications of course include all ages of each species but it is by no means obvious on the ordinary view why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists milne edwards and agassiz that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true the same fact holds good with flowering plants of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryoon the number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle in our discussion on embryology we shall see why such characters are so valuable on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds but in the case of crustaceans such definition has hitherto been found impossible there are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series which have hardly a character in common yet the species at both ends from being plainly allied to others and these to others and so onwards can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this and to no other class of the articulata geographical distribution has often been used though perhaps not quite logically in classification more especially in very large groups of closely allied forms temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds and it has been followed by several entomologists and botanists finally with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species such as orders suborders families subfamilies and genera they seem to be at least at present almost arbitrary several of the best botanists such as mr bentham and others have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value instances could be given amongst plants and insects of a group of forms first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family and this has been done not because further research has detected important structural differences at first overlooked but because numerous allied species with slightly different grades of difference have been subsequently discovered all the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained if i do not greatly deceive myself on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species are those which have been inherited from a common parent and in so far all true classification is genealogical that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking and not some unknown plan of creation or the enunciation of general propositions and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike but i must explain my meaning more fully i believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class in due subordination and relation to the other groups must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor may differ greatly being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera families sections or orders the reader will best understand what is meant if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter we will suppose the letters a to l to represent allied genera which lived during the silurian epoch and these have descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period species of three of these genera a f and i have transmitted modified descendants to the present day represented by the fifteen genera a to z on the uppermost horizontal line now all these modified descendants from a single species are represented as related in blood or descent to the same degree they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other the forms descended from a now broken up into two or three families constitute a distinct order from those descended from i also broken up into two families nor can the existing species descended from a be ranked in the same genus with the parent a or those from i with the parent i but the existing genus f may be supposed to have been but slightly modified and it will then rank with the parentgenus f just as some few still living organic beings belong to silurian genera so that the amount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same degree in blood has come to be widely different nevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true not only at the present time but at each successive period of descent all the modified descendants from a will have inherited something in common from their common parent as will all the descendants from i so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each successive period if however we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or of i have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of their parentage in this case their places in a natural classification will have been more or less completely lostas sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms all the descendants of the genus f along its whole line of descent are supposed to have been but little modified and they yet form a single genus but this genus though much isolated will still occupy its proper intermediate position for f originally was intermediate in character between a and i and the several genera descended from these two genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters this natural arrangement is shown as far as is possible on paper in the diagram but in much too simple a manner if a branching diagram had not been used and only the names of the groups had been written in a linear series it would have been still less possible to have given a natural arrangement and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series on a flat surface the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group thus on the view which i hold the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement like a pedigree but the degrees of modification which the different groups have undergone have to be expressed by ranking them under different socalled genera subfamilies families sections orders and classes it may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification by taking the case of languages if we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world and if all extinct languages and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects had to be included such an arrangement would i think be the only possible one yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little and had given rise to few new languages whilst others owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races descended from a common race had altered much and had given rise to many new languages and dialects the various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical and this would be strictly natural as it would connect together all languages extinct and modern by the closest affinities and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue in confirmation of this view let us glance at the classification of varieties which are believed or known to have descended from one species these are grouped under species with subvarieties under varieties and with our domestic productions several other grades of difference are requisite as we have seen with pigeons the origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups is the same with varieties as with species namely closeness of descent with various degrees of modification nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties as with species authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system we are cautioned for instance not to class two varieties of the pineapple together merely because their fruit though the most important part happens to be nearly identical no one puts the swedish and common turnips together though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar whatever part is found to be most constant is used in classing varieties thus the great agriculturist marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body c whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable because less constant in classing varieties i apprehend if we had a real pedigree a genealogical classification would be universally preferred and it has been attempted by some authors for we might feel sure whether there had been more or less modification the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points in tumbler pigeons though some subvarieties differ from the others in the important character of having a longer beak yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling but the shortfaced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit nevertheless without any reasoning or thinking on the subject these tumblers are kept in the same group because allied in blood and alike in some other respects if it could be proved that the hottentot had descended from the negro i think he would be classed under the negro group however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes with species in a state of nature every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification for he includes in his lowest grade or that of a species the two sexes and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes when adult and yet no one dreams of separating them the naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the same individual however much they may differ from each other and from the adult as he likewise includes the socalled alternate generations of steenstrup which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual he includes monsters he includes varieties not solely because they closely resemble the parentform but because they are descended from it he who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose or conversely ranks them together as a single species and gives a single definition as soon as three orchidean forms monochanthus myanthus and catasetum which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike they were immediately included as a single species but it may be asked what ought we to do if it could be proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced by a long course of modification from a bear ought we to rank this one species with bears and what should we do with the other species the supposition is of course preposterous and i might answer by the argumentum ad hominem and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the womb of a bear according to all analogy it would be ranked with bears but then assuredly all the other species of the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus the whole case is preposterous for where there has been close descent in common there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity as descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species though the males and females and larvæ are sometimes extremely different and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain and sometimes a considerable amount of modification may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera and genera under higher groups though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree and has taken a longer time to complete i believe it has thus been unconsciously used and only thus can i understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by
