i have stated in the preface to the zoology of the voyage of the beagle that it was in consequence of a wish expressed by captain fitzroy of having some scientific person on board accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own accommodations that i volunteered my services which received through the kindness of the hydrographer captain beaufort the sanction of the lords of the admiralty as i feel that the opportunities which i enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we visited have been wholly due to captain fitzroy i hope i may here be permitted to express my gratitude to him and to add that during the five years we were together i received from him the most cordial friendship and steady assistance both to captain fitzroy and to all the officers of the beagle i must likewise take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr bynoe the surgeon of the beagle for his very kind attention to me when i was ill at valparaiso i shall ever feel most thankful for the undeviating kindness with which i was treated during our long voyage the present volume contains in the form of a journal a sketch of those observations in geology and natural history which i thought would possess some general interest as it was originally intended to have preceded any more detailed account and as its publication has been unavoidably delayed the briefness and imperfection of several parts i hope will be excused i have given a list of those errata partly caused by my absence from town when some of the sheets were in the press which affect the sense and have added an appendix containing some additional facts especially on the theory of the transportation of erratic blocks which i have accidentally met with during the past year i hope shortly to publish my geological observations the first part of which will be on the volcanic islands of the atlantic and pacific oceans and on coral formations and the second part will treat of south america several numbers of the zoology of the voyage of the beagle due to the disinterested zeal of several of our first naturalists have already appeared these works could not have been undertaken had it not been for the liberality of the lords commissioners of her majestys treasury who through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of the exchequer have been pleased to grant a sum of one thousand pounds towards defraying part of the expenses of publication i have repeated in this volume my account of the habits of some of the birds and quadrupeds of south america as i thought such observations might interest those readers who would not probably consult the larger work but i trust that naturalists will remember that mere sketches are here given on several subjects which will hereafter be more fully entered on or have already been so for instance the notices of the strange fossil quadrupeds of the eastern plains of south america are exceedingly imperfect whilst an admirable account of them by mr owen now forms the first part of the zoology of the voyage of the beagle i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance i have received from several naturalists in the course of this and the succeeding works but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere thanks to the reverend professor henslow who when i was an undergraduate at cambridge was one chief means of giving me a taste for natural historywho during my absence took charge of the collections i sent home and by his correspondence directed my endeavoursand who since my return has

the volcanic fire of past ages and the scorching heat of a tropical sun have in most places rendered the soil sterile and unfit for vegetation the country rises in successive steps of table land interspersed with some truncate conical hills and the horizon is bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains the scene as beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate is one of great interest if indeed a person fresh from the sea and who has just walked for the first time in a grove of cocoanut trees can be a judge of any thing but his own happiness the island would generally be considered as very uninteresting but to any one accustomed only to an english landscape the novel prospect of an utterly sterile land possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil a single green leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains yet flocks of goats together with a few cows contrive to exist it rains very seldom but during a short portion of the year heavy torrents fall and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs out of every crevice this soon withers and upon such naturallyformed hay the animals live at the present time it has not rained for an entire year the broad flatbottomed valleys many of which serve during a few days only in the season as a watercourse are clothed with thickets of leafless bushes few living creatures inhabit these valleys the commonest bird is a kingfisher dacelo jagoensis which tamely sits on the branches of the castoroil plant and thence darts on the grasshoppers and lizards it is brightly coloured but not so beautiful as the european species in its flight manners and place of habitation which is generally in the driest valleys there is also a wide difference one day two of the officers and myself rode to ribeira grande a village a few miles to the eastward of porto praya until we reached the valley of st martin the country presented its usual dull brown appearance but there a very small rill of water produces a most refreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation in the course of an hour we arrived at ribeira grande and were surprised at the sight of a large ruined fort and cathedral the little town before its harbour was filled up was the principal place in the island it now presents a melancholy but very picturesque appearance having procured a black padre for a guide and a spaniard who had served in the peninsular war as an interpreter we visited a collection of buildings of which an ancient church formed the principal part it is here the governors and captaingenerals of the islands have been buried some of the tombstones recorded dates of the sixteenth century the heraldic ornaments were the only things in this retired place that reminded us of europe the church or chapel formed one side of a quadrangle in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were growing on another side was a hospital containing about a dozen miserablelooking inmates we returned to the vênda to eat our dinners a considerable number of men women and children all as black as jet were collected to watch us our companions were extremely merry and every thing we said or did was followed by their hearty laughter before leaving the town we visited the cathedral it does not appear so rich as the smaller church but boasts of a little organ which sent forth most singularly inharmonious cries we presented the black priest with a few shillings and the spaniard patting him on the head said with much candour he thought his colour made no great difference we then returned as fast as the ponies would go to porto praya another day we rode to the village of st domingo situated near the centre of the island on a small plain which we crossed a few stunted acacias were growing their tops by the action of the steady tradewind were bent in a singular mannersome of them even at a right angle to the trunk the direction of the branches was exactly ne by n and sw by s these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing direction of the force of the trade wind the travelling had made so little impression on the barren soil that we here missed our track and took that to fuentes this we did not find out till we arrived there and we were afterwards very glad of our mistake fuentes is a pretty village with a small stream and every thing appeared to prosper well excepting indeed that which ought to do so mostits inhabitants the black children completely naked and looking very wretched were carrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies near fuentes we saw a large flock of guineafowlprobably fifty or sixty in number they were extremely wary and could not be approached they avoided us like partridges on a rainy day in september running with their heads cocked up and if pursued they readily took to the wing the scenery of st domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected from the prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island the village is situated at the bottom of a valley bounded by lofty and jagged walls of stratified lava the black rocks afford a most striking contrast with the bright green vegetation which follows the banks of a little stream of clear water it happened to be a grand feastday and the village was full of people on our return we overtook a party of about twenty young black girls dressed in most excellent taste their black skins and snowwhite linen being set off by their coloured turbans and large shawls as soon as we approached near they suddenly all turned round and covering the path with their shawls sung with great energy a wild song beating time with their hands upon their legs we threw them some vintéms which were received with screams of laughter and we left them redoubling the noise of their song it has already been remarked that the atmosphere is generally very hazy this appears chiefly due to an impalpable dust which is constantly falling even on vessels far out at sea the dust is of a brown colour and under the blowpipe easily fuses into a black enamel it is produced as i believe from the wear and tear of volcanic rocks and must come from the coast of africa one morning the view was singularly clear the distant mountains being projected with the sharpest outline on a heavy bank of dark blue clouds judging from the appearance and from similar cases in england i supposed that the air was saturated with moisture the fact however turned out quite the contrary the hygrometer gave a difference of degrees between the temperature of the air and the point at which dew was precipitated this difference was nearly double that which i had observed on the previous mornings this unusual degree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of lightning is it not an uncommon case thus to find a remarkable degree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather the geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural history on entering the harbour a perfectly horizontal white band in the face of the sea cliff may be seen running for some miles along the coast and at the height of about fortyfive feet above the water upon examination this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous matter with numerous shells embedded such as now exist on the neighbouring coast it rests on ancient volcanic rocks and has been covered by a stream of basalt which must have entered the sea when the white shelly bed was lying at the bottom it is interesting to trace the changes produced by the heat of the overlying lava on the friable mass for a thickness of several inches it is converted in some parts into a firm stone as hard as the best freestone and the earthy matter originally mingled with the calcareous has been separated into little spots thus leaving the limestone white and pure in other parts a highly crystalline marble has been formed and so perfect are the crystals of carbonate of lime that they can easily be measured by the reflecting goniometer the change is even more extraordinary where the lime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower surface of the stream for it is there converted into groups of beautifully radiated fibres resembling arragonite the beds of lava rise in successive gentlysloping plains towards the interior whence the deluges of melted stone originally proceeded within historical times no signs of volcanic activity have i believe been manifested in any part of st jago this state of quiescence is probably owing to the neighbouring island of fogo being frequently in eruption even the form of a crater can but rarely be discovered on the summits of any of the red cindery hills yet the more recent streams can be distinguished on the coast forming a line of cliffs of less height but stretching out in advance of those belonging to an older series the height of the cliff thus affording a rude measure of the age during our stay i observed the habits of some marine animals a large aplysia is very common this seaslug is about five inches long and is of a dirty yellowish colour veined with purple at the anterior extremity it has two pair of feelers the upper ones of which resemble in shape the ears of a quadruped on each side of the lower surface or foot there is a broad membrane which appears sometimes to act as a ventilator in causing a current of water to flow over the dorsal branchiæ it feeds on delicate seaweeds which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water and i found in its stomach several small pebbles as in the gizzards of birds this slug when disturbed emits a very fine purplishred fluid which stains the water for the space of a foot around besides this means of defence an acrid secretion which is spread over its body causes a sharp stinging sensation similar to that produced by the physalia or portuguese manofwar i was much interested on several occasions by watching the habits of an octopus or cuttlefish although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide these animals were not easily caught by means of their long arms and suckers they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices and when thus fixed it required great force to remove them at other times they darted tail first with the rapidity of an arrow from one side of the pool to the other at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnutbrown ink these animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary chameleonlike power of changing their colour they appear to vary the tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass when in deep water their general shade was brownish purple but when placed on the land or in shallow water this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green the colour examined more carefully was a french gray with numerous minute spots of bright yellow the former of these varied in intensity the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns these changes were effected in such a manner that clouds varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut brown were continually passing over the body any part being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism became almost black a similar effect but in a less degree was produced by scratching the skin with a needle these clouds or blushes as they may be called when examined under a glass are described as being produced by the alternate expansions and contractions of minute vesicles containing variouslycoloured fluids this cuttlefish displayed its chameleonlike power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom i was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual which seemed fully aware that i was watching it remaining for a time motionless it would then stealthily advance an inch or two like a cat after a mouse sometimes changing its colour it thus proceeded till having gained a deeper part it darted away leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled while looking for marine animals with my head about two feet above the rocky shore i was more than once saluted by a jet of water accompanied by a slight grating noise at first i did not know what it was but afterwards i found out that it was the cuttlefish which though concealed in a hole thus often led me to its discovery that it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt and it appeared to me certain that it could moreover take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body from the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground i observed that one which i kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark st pauls rocksin crossing the atlantic we hove to during the morning of february th close to the island of st paul this cluster of rocks is situated in north latitude and west longitude it is miles distant from the coast of america and from the island of fernando noronha the highest point is only fifty feet above the level of the sea and the entire circumference is under threequarters of a mile this small point rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean its mineralogical constitution is not simple in some parts the rock is of a cherty in others of a felspathic nature and in the latter case it contains thin veins of serpentine mingled with calcareous matter the circumstance of these rocks not being of volcanic origin is of interest because with very few exceptions the islands situated in the midst of the great oceans are thus constituted as the highest pinnacles of the great mountain ranges probably once existed as islands distant from any continent we are led to expect that they would frequently consist of volcanic rocks it becomes therefore a curious point to speculate on the changes which many of the present islands would undergo during the lapse of the countless ages which would be required to elevate them into snowclad summits if we take the case of ascension or st helena both of which have long existed in an extinct condition we may feel assured before so vast a period could elapse during the whole of which the surface would be exposed to constant wear and tear that the mere nucleus or core of the island would remain perhaps every fragment of cellular rock having been decomposed a mass of some compact stone as phonolite or greenstone would crown our new chimborazo the rocks of st paul appear from a distance of a brilliantly white colour this is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of seafowl and partly to a coating of a glossy white substance which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks this when examined with a lens is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch the surface is smooth and glossy and has a pearly lustre it is considerably harder than calcareous spar although it can be scratched by a knife under the blowpipe it decrepitates slightly blackens and emits a fetid odour it consists of phosphate of lime mingled with some impurities and its origin without doubt is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds dung i may here mention that i found in some hollows in the lava rocks of ascension considerable masses of the substance called guano which on the west coast of the intertropical parts of south america occurs in great beds some yards thick on the islets frequented by seafowl according to the analysis of fourcroy and vauquelin it consists of the urates phosphates and oxalates of lime ammonia and potash together with some other salts and some fatty and earthy matter i believe there is no doubt of its being the richest manure which has ever been discovered at ascension close to the guano stalactitic or botryoidal masses of impure phosphate of lime adhered to the basalt the basal part of these had an earthy texture but the extremities were smooth and glossy and sufficiently hard to scratch common glass these stalactites appeared to have shrunk perhaps from the removal of some soluble matter in the act of consolidation and hence they had an irregular form similar stalactitic masses though i am not aware that they have ever been noticed are i believe by no means of uncommon occurrence we only observed two kinds of birdsthe booby and the noddy the former is a species of gannet and the latter a tern both are of a tame and stupid disposition and are so unaccustomed to visiters that i could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer the booby lays her eggs on the bare rock but the tern makes a very simple nest with seaweed by the side of many of these nests a small flyingfish was placed which i suppose had been brought by the male bird for its partner it was amusing to watch how quickly a large and active crab graspus which inhabits the crevices of the rock stole the fish from the side of the nest as soon as we had disturbed the birds not a single plant not even a lichen grows on this island yet it is inhabited by several insects and spiders the following list completes i believe the terrestrial fauna a species of feronia and an acarus which must have come here as parasites on the birds a small brown moth belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers a staphylinus quedius and a woodlouse from beneath the dung and lastly numerous spiders which i suppose prey on these small attendants on and scavengers of the waterfowl the oftenrepeated description of the first colonists of the coral islets in the south sea is not probably quite correct i fear it destroys the poetry of the story to find that these little vile insects should thus take possession before the cocoanut tree and other noble plants have appeared the smallest rock in the tropical seas by giving a foundation for the growth of innumerable kinds of seaweed and compound animals supports likewise a large number of fish the sharks and the seamen in the boats maintained a constant struggle who should secure the greater share of the prey caught by the lines i have heard that a rock near the bermudas lying many miles out at sea and covered by a considerable depth of water was first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed in the neighbourhood fernando noronha feb thas far as i was enabled to observe during the few hours we staid at this place the constitution of the island is volcanic but probably not of a recent date the most remarkable feature is a conical hill about one thousand feet high the upper part of which is exceedingly steep and on one side overhangs its base the rock is phonolite and is divided into irregular columns from the first impression on viewing one of these isolated masses one is inclined to believe that the whole has been suddenly pushed up in a semifluid state at st helena however i ascertained that some pinnacles of a nearly similar figure and constitution had been formed by the injection of melted rock among the yielding strata which thus formed the model for these gigantic obelisks the whole island is covered with wood but from the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance at some elevation great masses of the columnar rock shaded by laurels and ornamented by a tree covered by fine pink flowers like those of a foxglove but without a single leaf gave a pleasing effect to the nearer parts of the scenery bahia or san salvador brazil feb ththe day has past delightfully delight itself however is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who for the first time has been wandering by himself in a brazilian forest among the multitude of striking objects the general luxuuriance of the vegetation bears away the victory the elegance of the grasses the novelty of the parasitical plants the beauty of the flowers the glossy green of the foliage all tend to this end a most paradoxical mixture of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood the noise from the insects is so loud that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored several hundred yards from the shore yet within the recesses of the forest a universal silence appears to reign to a person fond of natural history such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he ever can hope again to experience after wandering about for some hours i returned to the landingplace but before reaching it i was overtaken by a tropical storm i tried to find shelter under a tree which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by common english rain but here in a couple of minutes a little torrent flowed down the trunk it is to this violence of the rain we must attribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods if the showers were like those of a colder clime the greater part would be absorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground i will not at present attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this noble bay because in our homeward voyage we called here a second time and i shall then have occasion to remark on it the geology of the surrounding country possesses little interest throughout the coast of brazil and certainly for a considerable space inland from the rio plata to cape st roque lat s a distance of more than geographical miles wherever solid rock occurs it belongs to a granitic formation the circumstance of this enormous area being thus constituted of materials which almost every geologist believes to have been crystallized by the action of heat under pressure gives rise to many curious reflections was this effect produced beneath the depths of a profound ocean or did a covering of strata formerly extend over it which has since been removed can we believe that any power acting for a time short of infinity could have denuded the granite over so many thousand square leagues on a point not far from the city where a rivulet entered the sea i observed a fact connected with a subject discussed by humboldt at the cataracts of the great rivers orinoco nile and congo the syenitic rocks are coated by a black substance appearing as if they had been polished with plumbago the layer is of extreme thinness and on analysis by berzelius it was found to consist of the oxides of manganese and iron in the orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically washed by the floods and in those parts alone where the stream is rapid or as the indians say the rocks are black where the waters are white the coating is here of a rich brown instead of a black colour and seems to be composed of ferrugineous matter alone hand specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones which glitter in the suns rays they occur only within the limits of tidal action and as the rivulet slowly trickles down the surf must supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers in the same manner the rise and fall of the tide probably answers to the periodical inundations and thus the same causes are present under apparently very different circumstances the real origin however of these coatings of metallic oxides which seem as if cemented to the rocks is not understood and no reason i believe can be assigned for their thickness remaining constant one day i was amused by watching the habits of a diodon which was caught swimming near the shore this fish is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself into a nearly spherical form after having been taken out of water for a short time and then again immersed in it a considerable quantity both of water and air was absorbed by the mouth and perhaps likewise by the branchial apertures this process is effected by two methods the air is swallowed and is then forced into the cavity of the body its return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally visible but the water i observed entered in a stream through the mouth which was wide open and motionless this latter action must therefore depend on suction the skin about the abdomen is much looser than that of the back hence during the inflation the lower surface becomes far more distended than the upper and the fish in consequence floats with its back downwards cuvier doubts whether the diodon in this position is able to swim but not only can it thus move forward in a straight line but likewise it can turn round to either side this latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins the tail being collapsed and not used from the body being buoyed up with so much air the branchial openings were out of water but a stream drawn in by the mouth constantly flowed through them the fish having remained in this distended state for a short time generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the branchial apertures and mouth it could emit at will a certain portion of the water and it appears therefore probable that this fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific gravity this diodon possessed several means of defence it could give a severe bite and could eject water from its mouth to some distance at the same time it made a curious noise by the movement of its jaws by the inflation of its body the papillæ with which the skin is covered became erect and pointed but the most curious circumstance was that it emitted from the skin of its belly when handled a most beautiful carmine red and fibrous secretion which stained ivory and paper in so permanent a manner that the tint is retained with all its brightness to the present day i am quite ignorant of the nature and use of this secretion march thwe sailed from bahia a few days afterwards when not far distant from the abrolhos islets my attention was called to a discoloured appearance in the sea the whole surface of the water as it appeared under a weak lens seemed as if covered by chopped bits of hay with their ends jagged one of the larger particles measured of an inch in length and in breadth examined more carefully each is seen to consist of from twenty to sixty cylindrical filaments which have perfectly rounded extremities and are divided at regular intervals by transverse septa containing a brownishgreen flocculent matter the filaments must be enveloped in some viscid fluid for the bundles adhered together without actual contact i do not know to what family these bodies properly belong but they have a close general resemblance in structure with the confervæ which grow in every ditch these simple vegetables thus constituted for floating in the open ocean must in certain places exist in countless numbers the ship passed through several bands of them one of which was about ten yards wide and judging from the mudlike colour of the water at least two and a half miles long in almost every long voyage some account is given of these confervæ they appear especially common in the sea near australia off cape leeuwin i found some very similar to those above described they differed chiefly in the bundles being rather smaller and being composed of fewer filaments captain cook in his third voyage remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the name of seasawdust i may here mention that during two days preceding our arrival at the keeling islands in the indian ocean i saw in many parts masses of flocculent matter of a brownishgreen colour floating in the sea they varied in size from half to to three or four inches square and were quite irregular in figure in an opake vessel they could barely be distinguished but in a glass one they were clearly visible under the microscope the flocculent matter was seen to consist of two kinds of confervæ between which i am quite ignorant whether there exists any connexion minute cylindrical bodies conical at each extremity are involved in vast numbers in a mass of fine threads these threads have a diameter of about of an inch they possess an internal lining and are divided at irregular and very wide intervals by transverse septa their length is so great that i could never with certainty ascertain the form of the uninjured extremity they are all curvilinear and resemble in mass a handful of hair coiled up and squeezed together in the midst of these threads and probably connected by some viscid fluid the other kind or the cylindrical transparent bodies float in great numbers these have their two extremities terminated by cones produced into the finest points their diameter is tolerably constant between and of an inch but their length varies considerably from to and even sometimes to near one extremity of the cylindrical part a green septum formed of granular matter and thickest in the middle may generally be seen this i believe is the bottom of a most delicate colourless sack composed of a pulpy substance which lines the exterior case but does not extend within the extreme conical points in some small but perfect spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the place of the septa and i observed the curious process by which they were produced the pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into lines some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre it then continued with an irregular and rapid movement to contract itself so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a perfect little sphere which occupied the position of the septum at one end of the now quite hollow case the appearance was as if an elastic membrane for instance a thin indianrubber ball had been distended with air and then burst in which case the edges would instantly shrink up and contract towards a point the formation of the granular sphere was hastened by any accidental injury i may add that frequently a pair of these bodies were attached to each other as represented in the accompanying rude drawing cone beside cone at that end where the septum occurs when floating uninjured in the sea the formation of the spherical gemmules perhaps only takes place when two of the plants or rather animals according to bory st vincent thus become attached and married to each other nevertheless i certainly witnessed this curious process in several individuals when separate and where there was no apparent cause of disturbance in any case it does not seem probable from the fixed structure of the septum that the whole of the granular matter is transferred from one to the other body as with the true conjugatæ i will here add a few other observations connected with the discoloration of the sea from organic causes on the coast of chile a few leagues north of concepcion the beagle one day passed through great bands of muddy water and again a degree south of valparaiso the same appearance was still more extensive although we were nearly fifty miles from the coast i at first attributed this circumstance to real streams of muddy water brought down by the river maypo mr sulivan however having drawn up some in a glass thought he distinguished by the aid of a lens moving points the water was slightly stained as if by red dust and after leaving it for some time quiet a cloud collected at the bottom with a lens of onefourth of an inch focal distance small hyaline points could be seen darting about with great rapidity and frequently exploding examined with a much higher power their shape was found to be oval and contracted by a ring round the middle from which line curved little setæ proceeded on all sides and these were the organs of motion one end of the body was narrower and more pointed than the other according to the arrangement of bory st vincent they are animalcula belonging to the family of trichodes it was however very difficult to examine them with care for almost the instant motion ceased even while crossing the field of vision their bodies burst sometimes both ends burst at once sometimes only one and a quantity of coarse brownish granular matter was ejected which cohered very slightly the ring with the setæ sometimes retained its irritability for a little while after the contents of the body had been emptied and continued a riggling uneven motion the animal an instant before bursting expanded to half again its natural size and the explosion took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had ceased in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a rotatory movement on the longer axis about two minutes after any number were isolated in a drop of water they thus perished the animals move with the narrow apex forwards by the aid of their vibratory ciliæ and generally by rapid starts they are exceedingly minute and quite invisible to the naked eye only covering a space equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch their numbers were infinite for the smallest drop of water which i could remove contained very many in one day we passed through two spaces of water thus stained one of which alone must have extended over several square miles what incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals the colour of the water as seen at some distance was like that of a river which has flowed through a red clay district but under the shade of the vessels side it was quite as dark as chocolate the line where the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined the weather for some days previously had been calm and the ocean abounded to an unusual degree with living creatures in ulloas voyage an account is given of crossing in nearly the same latitude some discoloured water which was mistaken for a shoal no soundings were obtained and i have no doubt from the description that this little animalcule was the cause of the alarm in the sea around tierra del fuego and at no great distance from the land i have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour from the number of crustacea which somewhat resemble in form large prawns the sealers call them whalefood whether whales feed on them i do not know but terns cormorants and immense herds of great unwieldly seals on some parts of the coast derive their chief sustenance from these swimming crabs seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the water to spawn but i found this to be the case only on one occasion at the distance of several leagues from the archipelago of the galapagos the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish or mudlike water these strips were some miles long but only a few yards wide and they were separated from the surrounding surface by a sinuous yet distinct margin the colour was caused by little gelatinous balls about the fifth of an inch in diameter in which numerous minute spherical ovules were embedded they were of two distinct kinds one being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other i cannot form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these belonged captain colnett remarks that this appearance is very common among the galapagos islands and that the direction of the bands indicates that of the currents in the described case however the line was caused by the wind the only other appearance which i have to notice is a thin oily coat on the surface which displays iridescent colours i saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the coast of brazil the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcass of some whale which probably was floating at no great distance i do not here mention the minute gelatinous particles which are frequently dispersed throughout the water for they are not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour there are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear very remarkable first how do the various bodies which form the bands with defined edges keep together in the case of the prawnlike crabs their movements were as coinstantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers but this cannot happen from any thing like voluntary action with the ovules or the confervæ nor is it probable among the infusoria secondly what causes the length and narrowness of the bands the appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent where the stream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the eddies that i must attribute the effect to a similar action either of the currents of the air or sea under this supposition we must believe that the various organized bodies are produced in certain favourable places and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water i confess however there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and confervæ for whence come the germs at such pointsthe parent bodies having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean but on no other hypothesis can i understand their linear grouping i may add that scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic animals is invariably found in a certain part of the arctic sea chapter ii rio de janeiro

accepted his kind offer of allowing me to accompany him april thour party amounted to seven the first stage was very interesting the day was powerfully hot and as we passed through the woods every thing was motionless excepting the large and brilliant butterflies which lazily fluttered about the view seen when crossing the hills behind praia grande was most beautiful the colours were intense and the prevailing tint a dark blue the sky and the calm waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour after passing through some cultivated country we entered a forest which in the grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded we arrived by midday at ithacaia this small village is situated on a plain and round the central house are the huts of the negroes these from their regular form and position reminded me of the drawings of the hottentot habitations in southern africa as the moon rose early we determined to start the same evening for our sleepingplace at the lagoa marica as it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive bare and steep hills of granite which are so common in this country this spot is notorious from having been for a long time the residence of some runaway slaves who by cultivating a little ground near the top contrived to eke out a subsistence at length they were discovered and a party of soldiers being sent the whole were seized with the exception of one old woman who sooner than again be led into slavery dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain in a roman matron this would have been called the noble love of freedom in a poor negress it is mere brutal obstinacy we continued riding for some hours for the few last miles the road was intricate and it passed through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons the scene by the dimmed light of the moon was most desolate a few fireflies flitted by us and the solitary snipe as it rose uttered its plaintive cry the distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night april thwe left our miserable sleepingplace before sunrise the road passed through a narrow sandy plain lying between the sea and the interior salt lagoons the number of beautiful fishing birds such as egrets and cranes and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical forms gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have possessed the few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideæ were most to be admired as the sun rose the day became extremely hot and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very distressing we dined at mandetiba the thermometer in the shade being the beautiful view of the distant wooded hills reflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon quite refreshed us as the vênda here was a very good one and i have the pleasant but rare remembrance of an excellent dinner i will be grateful and presently describe it as the type of its class these houses are often large and are built of thick upright posts with boughs interwoven and afterwards plastered they seldom have floors and never glazed windows but are generally pretty well roofed universally the front part is open forming a kind of verandah in which tables and benches are placed the bedrooms join on each side and here the passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can on a wooden platform covered by a thin straw mat the vênda stands in a courtyard where the horses are fed on first arriving it was our custom to unsaddle the horses and give them their indian corn then with a low bow to ask the senhôr to do us the favour to give us something to eat any thing you choose sir was his usual answer for the few first times vainly i thanked providence for having guided us to so good a man the conversation proceeding the case universally became deplorable any fish can you do us the favour of givingoh no sirany soup no sirany bread oh no sirany dried meatoh no sir if we were lucky by waiting a couple of hours we obtained fowls rice and farinha it not unfrequently happened that we were obliged to kill with stones the poultry for our own supper when thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger we timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal the pompous and though true most unsatisfactory answer was it will be ready when it is ready if we had dared to remonstrate any further we should have been told to proceed on our journey as being too impertinent the hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners their houses and their persons are often filthily dirty the want of the accommodation of forks knives and spoons is common and i am sure no cottage or hovel in england could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every comfort at campos novos however we fared sumptuously having rice and fowls biscuit wine and spirits for dinner coffee in the evening and fish with coffee for breakfast all this with good food for the horses only cost s d per head yet the host of this vênda being asked if he knew any thing of a whip which one of the party had lost gruffly answered how should i know why did you not take care of iti suppose the dogs have eat it leaving mandetiba we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness of lakes in some of which were fresh in others salt water shells of the former kind i found a limnæa in great numbers in a lake into which the inhabitants assured me the sea annually and sometimes oftener entered and made the water quite salt i have no doubt many interesting facts in relation to marine and fresh water animals might be observed in this chain of lagoons which skirt the coast of brazil m gay has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of rio shells of the marine genera solen and mytilus and fresh water ampullariæ living together in brackish water i also frequently observed in the lagoon near the botanic garden where the water is only a little less salt than in the sea a species of hydrophilus very similar to a species common in the ditches of england in the same lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in estuaries leaving the coast for a time we again entered the forest the trees were very lofty and remarkable compared to those of europe from the whiteness of their trunks i see by my notebook wonderful and beautiful flowering parasites invariably struck me as the most novel object in these grand scenes travelling onwards we passed through tracts of pasturage much injured by the enormous conical ants nests which were nearly twelve feet high they gave to the plain exactly the appearance of the mud volcanoes at jorullo as figured by humboldt we arrived at engenhodo after it was dark having been ten hours on horseback i never ceased during the whole journey to be surprised at the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring they appeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our english breed the vampire bat is often the cause of much trouble by biting the horses on their withers the injury is generally not so much owing to the loss of blood as to the inflammation which the pressure of the saddle afterwards produces the whole circumstance has lately been doubted in england i was therefore fortunate in being present when one was actually caught on a horses back we were bivouacking late one evening near coquimbo in chile when my servant noticing that one of the horses was very restive went to see what was the matter and fancying he could distinguish something suddenly put his hand on the beasts withers and secured the vampire in the morning the spot where the bite had been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and bloody the third day afterwards we rode the horse without any ill effects april thafter three days travelling we arrived at socêgo the estate of senhôr manuel figuireda a relation of one of our party the house was simple and though like a barn in form was well suited to the climate in the sittingroom gilded chairs and sofas were oddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls thatched roof and windows without glass the house together with the granaries the stables and workshops for the blacks who had been taught various trades formed a rude kind of quadrangle in the centre of which a large pile of coffee was drying these buildings stand on a little hill overlooking the cultivated ground and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green luxuriant forest the chief produce of this part of the country is coffee each tree is supposed to yield annually on an average two pounds but some give as much as eight mandioca or cassada is likewise cultivated in great quantity every part of this plant is useful the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses and the roots are ground into a pulp which when pressed dry and baked forms the farinha the principal article of sustenance in the brazils it is a curious though wellknown fact that the expressed juice of this most nutritious plant is highly poisonous a few years ago a cow died at this fazênda in consequence of having drunk some of it senhôr figuireda told me that he had planted the year before one bag of feijaô or beans and three of rice the former of which produced eighty and the latter three hundred and twenty fold the pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle and the woods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days this profusion of food showed itself at dinner where if the tables did not groan the guests surely did for each person is expected to eat of every dish one day having as i thought nicely calculated so that nothing should go away untasted to my utter dismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial reality during the meals it was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds and dozens of little black children which crawled in together at every opportunity as long as the idea of slavery could be banished there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and patriarchal style of living it was such a perfect retirement and independence of the rest of the world as soon as any stranger is seen arriving a large bell is set tolling and generally some small cannon are fired the event is thus announced to the rocks and woods but to nothing else one morning i walked out an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene at last the silence was broken by the morning hymn raised on high by the whole body of the blacks and in this manner their daily work is generally begun on such fazendas as these i have no doubt the slaves pass happy and contented lives on saturday and sunday they work for themselves and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week april thleaving socêgo we rode to another estate on the rio macâe which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction the estate was two and a half miles long and the owner had forgotten how many broad only a very small piece had been cleared yet almost every acre was capable of yielding all the various rich productions of a tropical land considering the enormous area of brazil the proportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as any thing compared to that which is left in the state of nature at some future age how vast a population it will support during the second days journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers the forest abounded with beautiful objects among which the tree ferns though not large were from their bright green foliage and the elegant curvature of their fronds most worthy of admiration in the evening it rained very heavily and although the thermometer stood at i felt very cold as soon as the rain ceased it was curious to observe the extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the forest at the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a dense white vapour which rose like columns of smoke from the most thicklywooded parts and especially from the valleys i observed this phenomenon on several occasions i suppose it is owing to the large surface of foliage previously heated by the suns rays while staying at this estate i was very nearly being an eyewitness to one of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave country owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit the owner was on the point of taking all the women and children from the men and selling them separately at the public auction at rio interest and not any feeling of compassion prevented this act indeed i do not believe the inhumanity of separating thirty families who had lived together for many years even occurred to the person yet i will pledge myself that in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of men it may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest and selfish habit i may mention one very trifling anecdote which at the time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty i was crossing a ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid in endeavouring to make him understand i talked loud and made signs in doing which i passed my hand near his face he i suppose thought i was in a passion and was going to strike him for instantly with a frightened look and halfshut eyes he dropped his hands i shall never forget my feelings of surprise disgust and shame at seeing a great powerful man afraid even to ward off a blow directed as he thought at his face this man had been trained to a degradation lower than the slavery of the most helpless animal april thin returning we spent two days at socêgo and i employed them in collecting insects in the forest the greater number of trees although so lofty are not more than three or four feet in circumference there are of course a few of much greater dimension senhor manuel was then making a canoe seventy feet in length from a solid trunk which had originally been feet long and of great thickness the contrast of palmtrees growing amidst the common branching kinds never fails to give the scene an intertropical character here the woods were ornamented by the cabbage palmone of the most beautiful of its family with a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two hands it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet above the ground the woody creepers themselves covered by other creepers were of great thickness some which i measured were two feet in circumference many of the older trees presented a very curious appearance from the tresses of a liana depending from their boughs and resembling bundles of hay if the eye was turned from the world of foliage above to the
