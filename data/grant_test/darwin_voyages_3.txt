these animals that horses in passing over sink above their fetlocks the tucutucos appear to a certain degree to be gregarious the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six together and he said this was a common occurrence they are nocturnal in their habits and their principal food is afforded by the roots of plants which is the object of their extensive and superficial burrows azara says they are so difficult to be obtained that he never saw more than one he states that they lay up magazines of food within their burrows this animal is universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when beneath the ground a person the first time he hears it is much surprised for it is not easy to tell whence it comes nor is it possible to guess what kind of creature utters it the noise consists in a short but not rough nasal grunt which is repeated about four times in quick succession the first grunt is not so loud but a little longer and more distinct than the three following the musical time of the whole is constant as often as it is uttered the name tucutuco is given in imitation of the sound in all times of the day where this animal is abundant the noise may be heard and sometimes directly beneath ones feet when kept in a room the tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily which appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs and they are likewise quite incapable of jumping even the smallest vertical height mr reid who dissected a specimen which i brought home in spirits informs me that the socket of the thighbone is not attached by a ligamentum teres and this explains in a satisfactory manner the awkward movements of their hinder extremities when eating they rest on their hind legs and hold the piece in their fore paws they appeared also to wish to drag it into some corner they are very stupid in making any attempt to escape when angry or frightened they uttered the tucutuco of those i kept alive several even the first day became quite tame not attempting to bite or to run away others were a little wilder the man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found blind a specimen which i preserved in spirits was in this state mr reid considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating membrane when the animal was alive i placed my finger within half an inch of its head and not the slightest notice was taken it made its way however about the room nearly as well as the others considering the subterranean habits of the tucutuco the blindness though so frequent cannot be a very serious evil yet it appears strange that any animal should possess an organ constantly subject to injury the mole whose habits in nearly every respect excepting in the kind of food are so similar has an extremely small and protected eye which although possessing a limited vision at once seems adapted to its manner of life birds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy plains around maldonado several species of the genus cassicus allied to our starlings in habits and structure and of tyrantflycatchers and a mockingbird from their numbers give a character to the ornithology some of the cassici are very beautiful black and yellow being the prevailing colours but oriolus ruber gme offers an exception in having its head shoulders and thighs of the most splendid scarlet this bird differs from its congeners in being solitary it frequents marshes and seated on the summit of a low bush with its mouth wide open utters a plaintive agreeable cry which can be heard at a long distance another species of a purplishblack colour with a metallic lustre feeds on the plain in large flocks mingled with other birds several may often be seen standing on the back of a cow or horse while perched on a hedge and pluming themselves in the sun they sometimes attempt to sing or rather to hiss the noise is very peculiar it resembles that of bubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water so as to produce an acute sound azara states that this bird like the cuckoo deposits its eggs in other birds nests i was several times told by the country people that there was some bird with this habit and my assistant in collecting who is a very accurate person found a nest of the sparrow of the country with one egg in it larger than the others and of a different colour and shape mr swainson has remarked that with the exception of the molothrus pecoris the cuckoos are the only birds which can be called truly parasitical namely such as fasten themselves as it were on another living animal whose animal heat brings their young into life whose food they alone live upon and whose death would cause theirs during the period of infancy the molothrus pecoris is a northamerican bird and is closely allied in general habits even in such peculiarities as standing on the backs of cattle as its name implies and in appearance with the species from the plains of la plata it only differs in being rather smaller and of a different colour yet the two birds would be considered by every naturalist as distinct species it is very interesting to see so close an agreement in structure and in habits between allied species coming from opposite parts of a great continent it is also very remarkable that the cuckoos and the molothri although opposed to each other in almost every habit should agree in the one strange one of their parasitical propagation the molothrus like our starling is eminently sociable and lives on the open plains without art or disguise the cuckoo as every one knows is a singularly shy bird it frequents the most retired thickets and feeds on fruit and caterpillars in structure these birds are likewise widely removed from each other i will only mention two other birds which are very common and render themselves prominent from their habits the saurophagus sulphureus is typical of the great american tribe of tyrantflycatchers in its structure it closely approaches the true shrikes but in its habits may be compared to many birds i have frequently observed it hunting a field hovering over one spot like a hawk and then proceeding on to another when thus seen suspended in the air it might very readily at a short distance be mistaken for one of the rapacious order its stoop however is very inferior in force and rapidity at other times the saurophagus haunts the neighbourhood of water and there like a kingfisher remaining stationary it catches any small fish which may come near the margin these birds are not unfrequently kept either in cages or in courtyards with their wings cut they soon become tame and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners which were described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie their flight is undulatory for the weight of the head and bill appear too great for the body in the evening the saurophagus takes its stand on a bush often by the roadside and continually repeats without change a shrill and rather agreeable cry which somewhat resembles articulate words the spaniards say it is like the words bien te veo i see you well and accordingly have given it this name a mockingbird orpheus modulator called by the inhabitants calandria is remarkable from possessing a song far superior to that of any other bird in the country indeed it is nearly the only bird in south america which i have observed to take its stand for the purpose of singing the song may be compared to that of the sedge warbler but is more powerful some harsh notes and some very high ones being mingled with a pleasant warbling it is heard only during the spring at other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious it frequents thickets and hedges is very active and whilst quickly hopping about often expands its tail near maldonado these birds were tame and bold they constantly attended in numbers the country houses to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or walls if any other small bird joined the feast the calandria directly chased it away on the wide uninhabited plains of patagonia another closely allied species o patagonica of dorbigny which frequents the valleys clothed with spiny bushes is a wilder bird and has a slightly different tone of voice it appears to me a curious circumstance as showing the fine shades of difference in habits that judging from this latter respect alone when i first saw this second species i thought it was different from the maldonado kind having afterwards procured a specimen and comparing the two without particular care they appeared so very similar that i changed my opinion but now mr gould says that they are certainly distinct a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit of which however he was not aware i will conclude these few ornithological observations with an account of the various carrionfeeding hawks which frequent the extratropical parts of south america the number tameness and disgusting habits of these birds make them preeminently striking to any one accustomed only to the birds of northern europe in this list may be included four species of the caracara or polyborus the turkey buzzard the gallinazo and the condor the caracaras are from their structure placed among the eagles we shall soon see how ill they become so high a rank in their habits they well supply the place of our carrioncrows magpies and ravens a tribe of birds which is totally wanting in south america to begin with the polyborus braziliensis this is a common bird and has a wide geographical range it is most numerous on the grassy savannahs of la plata where it goes by the name of carrancha and is far from unfrequent throughout the sterile plains of patagonia in the desert between the rivers negro and colorado numbers constantly attended the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted animals which chanced to perish from fatigue and thirst although thus common in these dry and open countries and likewise on the arid shores of the pacific it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious forests of west patagonia and tierra del fuego the carranchas together with the polyborus chimango constantly attend in numbers the estancias and slaughteringhouses if an animal dies on the plain the gallinazo commences the feast and then the two caracaras pick the bones clean these birds although thus commonly feeding together are far from being friends when the carrancha is quietly seated on the branch of a tree or on the ground the chimango often continues for a long time flying backwards and forwards up and down in a semicircle trying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger relative the carrancha takes little notice except by bobbing its head although the carranchas frequently assemble in numbers they are not gregarious for in desert places they may be seen solitary or more commonly by pairs besides the carrion of large animals these birds frequent the borders of streams and sea beaches to pick up whatever the waters may cast on shore in tierra del fuego and on the west coast of patagonia they must exclusively live on such supplies the carranchas are said to be very crafty and to steal great numbers of eggs they attempt also together with the chimango to pick off the scabs from the sore backs of the horses and mules the poor animal on the one hand with its ears down and its back arched and on the other the hovering bird eyeing at the distance of a yard the disgusting morsel form a picture which has been described by captain head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy the carranchas kill wounded animals but mr bynoe saw one seize in the air a live partridge which escaped and was for some time chased on the ground i believe this circumstance is very unusual at all events there is no doubt that the chief part of their sustenance is derived from carrion a person will discover the necrophagous habits of the carrancha by walking out on one of the desolate plains and there lying down to sleep when he awakes he will see on each surrounding hillock one of these birds patiently watching him with an evil eye it is a feature in the landscape of these countries which will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them if a party goes out hunting with dogs and horses it will be accompanied during the day by several of these attendants after feeding the uncovered craw protrudes at such times and indeed generally the carrancha is an inactive tame and cowardly bird its flight is heavy and slow like that of an english rook it seldom soars but i have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the air with much ease it runs in contradistinction to hopping but not quite so quickly as some of its congeners at times the carrancha is noisy but is not generally so its cry is loud very harsh and peculiar and may be likened to the sound of the spanish guttural g followed by a rough double r r perhaps the gauchos from this cause have called it carrancha molina who says it is called tharu in chile states that when uttering this cry it elevates its head higher and higher till at last with its beak wide open the crown almost touches the lower part of the back this fact which has been doubted is quite true i have seen them several times with their heads backwards in a completely inverted position the carrancha builds a large coarse nest either in a low cliff or in a bush or lofty tree to these observations i may add on the high authority of azara that the carrancha feeds on worms shells slugs grasshoppers and frogs that it destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical cord and that it pursues the gallinazo till that bird is compelled to vomit up the carrion it may have recently gorged lastly azara states that several carranchas five or six together will unite in chase of large birds even such as herons all these facts show that it is a bird of very versatile habits and considerable ingenuity the polyborus chimango is considerably smaller than the last species it is common on both sides of the continent but does not appear to extend so far northward as the last species it is found in chiloe and on the coast of patagonia and i have seen it in tierra del fuego we have already remarked that it feeds on carrion in common with the carrancha it is generally the last bird which leaves the skeleton and may often be seen within the ribs of a cow or horse like a bird in a cage the chimango often frequents the seacoast and the borders of lakes and swamps where it picks up small fish it is truly omnivorous and will eat even bread when thrown out of a house with other offal i was also assured that they materially injure the potato crops in chiloe by stocking up the roots when first planted in the same island i myself saw them by scores following the plough and feeding on the worms and larvæ of insects i do not believe they ever kill birds or animals they are more active than the carranchas but their flight is heavy i never saw one soar they are very tame are not gregarious commonly perch on stone walls and not upon trees and frequently utter a gentle shrill scream the third species of polyborus is remarkable from the confined localities which it frequents we met with it only in one valley in patagonia the last species which we have to mention is the polyborus novæ zelandiæ this bird is exceedingly numerous over the whole of the falkland islands which appear to be its metropolis i was informed by the sealers that they are found in the diego ramirez rocks and the ildefonso isles but never on the mainland of tierra del fuego nor do they occur on georgia or the more southern islands in many respects these hawks resemble in their habits the carranchas they live on the flesh of dead animals and on marine productions and on the ramirez rocks their whole sustenance must depend on the sea they are extraordinarily tame and fearless and haunt the neighbourhood of houses for offal if a hunting party kills an animal a number soon collect and patiently await standing on the ground on all sides after eating their uncovered craws are largely protruded giving them a disgusting appearance they readily attack wounded birds a cormorant in this state having taken to the shore was immediately seized on by several and its death hastened by their blows the beagle was at the falklands only during the summer but the officers of the adventure who were there in the winter mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and rapacity of these birds they actually pounced on a dog that was lying fast asleep close by one of the party and the sportsmen had difficulty in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes it is said that several together in this respect resembling the carranchas wait at the mouth of a rabbithole and together seize on the animal when it comes out they were constantly flying on board the vessel when in the harbour and it was necessary to keep a good look out to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging and the meat or game from the stern these birds are very mischievous and inquisitive they will pick up almost any thing from the ground a large black glazed hat was carried nearly a mile as was a pair of the heavy balls used in catching cattle mr usborne experienced during the survey a more severe loss in their stealing a small katers compass in a red morocco leather case which was never recovered these birds are moreover quarrelsome and very passionate tearing up the grass with their bills from rage they are not truly gregarious do not soar their flight is heavy and clumsy on the ground they run with extreme quickness very much like pheasants they are noisy uttering several harsh cries one of which is like that of the english rook hence the sealers always so call them it is a curious circumstance that when crying out they throw their heads upwards and backwards after the same manner as the carrancha they build on the rocky cliffs of the seacoast but only in the small islets and not in the two main islands this is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird the sealers say that the flesh of these birds when cooked is quite white and very good eating we have now only to mention the turkeybuzzard vultur aura and the gallinazo the former is found wherever the country is moderately damp from cape horn to north america differently from the polyborus braziliensis and chimango it has found its way to the falkland islands the turkeybuzzard is a solitary bird or at most goes in pairs it may at once be recognised from a long distance by its lofty soaring and most elegant flight it is well known to be a true carrion feeder on the west coast of patagonia among the thicklywooded islets and broken land it lives exclusively on what the sea throws up and on the carcasses of dead seals wherever these animals are congregated on the rocks there the vultures may be seen the gallinazo cathartes atratus has a different range from the last species as it never occurs to the southward of lat azara states that there existed a tradition that these birds at the time of the conquest were not to be found near monte video but that they subsequently followed the inhabitants from more northern districts at the present day they are numerous in the valley of the colorado which is three hundred miles due south of monte video it seems probable that this additional migration has happened since the time of azara the gallinazo generally prefers a humid climate or rather the neighbourhood of fresh water hence it is extremely abundant in brazil and la plata while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of northern patagonia excepting near some stream these birds frequent the whole pampas to the foot of the cordillera but i never saw or heard of one in chile in peru they are preserved as scavengers these vultures certainly may be called gregarious for they seem to have pleasure in society and are not solely brought together by the attraction of a common prey on a fine day a flock may often be observed at a great height each bird wheeling round and round without closing its wings in the most graceful evolutions this is clearly done for sportsake or perhaps is connected with their matrimonial alliances i have now mentioned all the carrionfeeders excepting the condor an account of which will be more appropriately introduced when we visit a country more congenial to its habits than the plains of la plata in a broad band of sandhillocks which separate the laguna del potrero from the shores of the plata at the distance of a few miles from maldonado i found a group of those vitrified siliceous tubes which are generally supposed to have been formed by lightning entering the loose sand these tubes resemble in every particular those from drigg in cumberland described in the geological transactions the sandhillocks of maldonado not being protected by vegetation are constantly changing their position from this cause the tubes projected above the surface and numerous fragments lying near showed that they had formerly been buried to a greater depth four sets entered the sand perpendicularly by working with my hands i traced one of them two feet deep and some fragments which evidently had belonged to the same tube when added to the other part measured five feet three inches the diameter of the whole was nearly equal and therefore we must suppose that originally it extended to a much greater depth these dimensions are however small compared to those of the tubes from drigg one of which was traced to a depth of not less than thirty feet the internal surface is completely vitrified glossy and smooth a small fragment examined under the microscope appeared from the number of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles like an assay fused before the blowpipe the sand is entirely or in greater part siliceous but some points are of a black colour and from their glossy surface possess a metallic lustre the thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch and occasionally even equals a tenth on the outside the grains of sand are rounded and have a slightly glazed appearance i could not distinguish any sign of crystallization in a similar manner to that described in the geological transactions the tubes are generally compressed and have deep longitudinal furrows so as closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk or the bark of the elm or cork tree their circumference is about two inches but in some fragments which are cylindrical and without any furrows it is double or four inches the compression from the surrounding loose sand acting while the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat has evidently caused the creases or furrows judging from the uncompressed fragments the measure or bore of the lightning if such a term may be used must have been about one inch and a quarter at paris m hachette and m beaudant succeeded in making tubes in most respects similar to these fulgurites by passing very strong shocks of galvanism through finelypowdered glass when salt was added so as to increase its fusibility the tubes were larger in every dimension they failed both with powdered felspar and quartz one tube formed with pounded glass was very nearly an inch long namely and had an internal diameter of when we hear that the strongest battery in paris was used and that the effect on a substance of such easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive we must feel greatly astonished at the power of a shock of lightning which striking the sand in several places has formed a cylinder in one instance of at least thirty feet long and having an internal bore where not compressed of full an inch and a half and this in a material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz the tubes as i have already remarked enter the sand nearly in a vertical direction one however which was less regular than the generality had a deviation from a right line which amounted at the most considerable bend to thirtythree degrees from this same tube two small branches about a foot apart were sent off one pointed downwards and the other upwards this latter case is remarkable as the electric fluid must have turned back at the acute angle of to the line of its main course besides the four tubes which i found vertical and traced beneath the surface there were several other groups of fragments the original site of which without doubt was near all occurred in a level area sixty yards by twenty of shifting sand situated among some high sandhillocks and at the distance of about half a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height the most remarkable circumstance as it appears to me in this case as well as in that of drigg and in one described by m ribbentrop in germany is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces at drigg within an area of fifteen yards three were observed and the same number occurred in germany in the case which i have described certainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by twenty yards as it does not appear probable that the tubes are produced by successive and distinct shocks we must believe that the lightning shortly before entering the ground divides itself into separate branches the neighbourhood of the rio plata seems peculiarly subject to electric phenomena in the year one of the most destructive thunderstorms perhaps on record happened at buenos ayres thirtyseven places within the city were struck by lightning and nineteen people killed from facts stated in several books of travels i am inclined to suspect that thunderstorms are very common near the mouths of great rivers is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh water with the salt may disturb the electrical equilibrium even during our occasional visits to this part of south america we heard of a ship two churches and a house having been struck both the church and the house i saw shortly afterwards the house belonged to mr hood the consulgeneral at monte video some of the effects were curious the paper for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the bellwires had run was blackened the metal had been fused and although the room was at least fifteen feet high the globules dropping on the chairs and furniture had drilled in them a chain of minute holes a part of the wall was shattered as if by gunpowder and the fragments had been blown off with force sufficient to dent the walls on the opposite side of the room the frame of a lookingglass was blackened and the gilding must have been volatilized for a smellingbottle which stood on the chimneypiece was coated with bright metallic particles which adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled chapter iv rio negro estancias attacked by indians salt

the whole line of coast between the straits of magellan and the plata it enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the estuary of the latter about fifty years since under the old spanish government a small colony was established here and it is still the most southern position lat on this eastern coast of america which is inhabited by civilized man the country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme on the south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences which exposes a section of the geological nature of the country the strata are of sandstone and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a firmlycemented conglomerate of pumice pebbles which must have travelled more than four hundred miles from the andes the surface is every where covered up by a thick bed of gravel which extends far and wide over the open plain water is extremely scarce and where found is almost invariably brackish the vegetation is scanty and although there are bushes of many kinds all are armed with formidable thorns which seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable regions the settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river the road follows the foot of the sloping cliff which forms the northern boundary of the great valley in which the rio negro flows on the way we passed the ruins of some fine estancias which a few years since were destroyed by the indians they withstood several attacks a man present at one gave me a very lively description of what took place the inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle and horses into the corral which surrounded the house and likewise to mount some small cannon the indians were araucanians from the south of chile several hundreds in number and highly disciplined they first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill having there dismounted and taken off their fur mantles they advanced naked to the charge the only weapon of an indian is a very long bamboo or chuzo ornamented with ostrich feathers and pointed by a sharp spear head my informer seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of these chuzos as they approached near when close the cacique pincheira hailed the besieged to give up their arms or he would cut all their throats as this would probably have been the result of their entrance under any circumstances the answer was given by a volley of musketry the indians with great steadiness came to the very fence of the corral but to their surprise they found the posts fastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs and of course in vain attempted to cut them with their knives this saved the lives of the christians many of the wounded indians were carried away by their companions and at last one of the under caciques being wounded the bugle sounded a retreat they retired to their horses and seemed to hold a council of war this was an awful pause for the spaniards as all their ammunition with the exception of a few cartridges was expended in an instant the indians mounted their horses and galloped out of sight another attack was still more quickly repulsed a cool frenchman managed the gun he stopped till the indians approached close and then raked their line with grapeshot he thus laid thirtynine of them on the ground and of course such a blow immediately routed the whole party the town is indifferently called el carmen or patagones it is built on the face of a cliff which fronts the river and many of the houses are excavated even in the sandstone the river is about two or three hundred yards wide and is deep and rapid the many islands with their willowtrees and the flat headlands seen one behind the other on the northern boundary of the broad green valley forms by the aid of a bright sun a view almost picturesque the number of inhabitants does not exceed a few hundreds these spanish colonies do not like our british ones carry within themselves the elements of growth many indians of pure blood reside here the tribe of the cacique lucanee constantly have their toldos on the outskirts of the town the local government partly supplies them with provisions by giving them all the old worn out horses and they earn a little by making horserugs and other articles of riding gear these indians are considered civilized but what their character may have gained by a lesser degree of ferocity is almost counterbalanced by their entire immorality some of the younger men are however improving they are willing to labour and a short time since a party went on a sealing voyage and behaved very well they were now enjoying the fruits of their labour by being dressed in very gay clean clothes and by being very idle the taste they showed in their dress was admirable if you could have turned one of these young indians into a statue of bronze his drapery would have been perfectly graceful one day i rode to a large salt lake or salina which is distant fifteen miles from the town during the winter it consists of a shallow lake of brine which in summer is converted into a field of snowwhite salt the layer near the margin is from four to five inches thick but towards the centre its thickness increases this lake was two and a half miles long and one broad others occur in the neighbourhood many times larger and with a floor of salt two and three feet in thickness even when under water during the winter one of these brilliantlywhite and level expanses in the midst of the brown and desolate plain offers an extraordinary spectacle a large quantity of salt is annually drawn from the salina and great piles some hundred tons in weight were lying ready for exportation it is singular that the salt although well crystallized and appearing quite pure does not answer so well for preserving meat as sea salt from the cape de verd islands although the latter is necessarily much dearer it is constantly imported and mixed with the salt procured from these salinas a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered the cape de verd salt worth fifty per cent more than that from the rio negro the season for working the salinas forms the harvest of patagones for on it the prosperity of the place depends nearly the whole population encamps on the banks of the river and the people are employed in drawing out the salt in bullockwaggons the border of the lake is formed of mud and in this numerous large crystals of gypsum some of which are three inches long lie embedded whilst on the surface others of sulphate of magnesia lie scattered about the gauchos call the former the padre del sal and the latter the madre they state that these progenitive salts always occur on the borders of the salinas when the water begins to evaporate the mud is black and has a fetid odour i could not at first imagine the cause of this but i afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind drifted on shore was coloured green as if by confervæ i attempted to carry home some of this green matter but from an accident failed parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish colour and this perhaps was owing to some infusorial animalcula the mud in many places was thrown up by numbers of some kind of worm or annelidous animal how surprising it is that any creatures should be able to exist in a fluid saturated with brine and that they should be crawling among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime and what becomes of these worms when during a long summer the surface at least is hardened into a solid layer of salt flamingoes in considerable numbers inhabit this lake they breed here and their bodies are sometimes found by the workmen preserved in the salt i saw several wading about in search of foodprobably for the worms which burrow in the mud and these latter perhaps feed on infusoria or confervæ thus we have a little world within itself adapted to these little inland seas of brine with respect to the geological position of the salinas they occur either in the plains composed of shingle and overlying various deposits or within the grand calcareoargillaceous formation of the pampas the only rule i can discover is that they do not occur where the substratum is granitic as in brazil and banda oriental i know of their occasional existence over the immense territory extending from lat near the rio vermejo to south the climate may generally be considered as rather dry at least such is the case in patagonia where the salinas are most numerous those which i saw occurred in depressions whence there was no exit in a more humid climate the water flowing from the lake would soon have hollowed a channel in the soft strata and thus converted the depression of the soil into an ordinary valley there is reason to believe that the whole of these great plains have been raised above the level of the sea within a recent geological period may we not then consider the salinas as the receptacles of the washings of the sedimentary strata on this idea we understand their absence where the land is granitic it is manifest that these great natural evaporating dishes can only occur where the amount of annual rain is small to the northward of the rio negro between it and the inhabited country near buenos ayres the spaniards have only one small settlement recently established at bahia blanca the distance in a straight line to the capital is very nearly five hundred british miles the wandering tribes of horse indians which have always occupied the greater part of this country having of late much harassed the outlying estancias the government at buenos ayres equipped some time since an army under the command of general rosas for the purpose of exterminating them the troops were now encamped on the banks of the colorado a river lying about eighty miles to the northward of the rio negro when general rosas left buenos ayres he struck in a direct line across the unexplored plains and as the country was thus pretty well cleared of indians he left behind him at wide intervals a small party of soldiers with a troop of horses a posta so as to be enabled to keep up a communication with the capital as the beagle intended to call at bahia blanca i determined to proceed there by land and ultimately i extended my plan so as to travel the whole way by the postas to buenos ayres august thmr harris an englishman residing at patagones a guide and five gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business were my companions on the journey the colorado as i have already said is nearly eighty miles distant and as we travelled slowly we were two days and a half on the road the whole line of country deserves scarcely a better name than that of a desert water is found only in two small wells it is called fresh but even at this time of the year during the rainy season it was quite brackish in the summer this must be a distressing passage for now it was sufficiently desolate the valley of the rio negro broad as it is has merely been excavated out of the sandstone plain for immediately above the bank on which the town stands a level country commences which is interrupted only by a few trifling valleys and depressions every where the landscape wears the same sterile aspect a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown withered grass and low scattered bushes armed with thorns shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous tree which the indians reverence as the altar of walleechu it is situated on a high part of the plain and hence is a landmark visible at a great distance as soon as a tribe of indians come in sight of it they offer their adorations by loud shouts the tree itself is low much branched and thorny just above the root it has a diameter of about three feet it stands by itself without any neighbour and was indeed the first tree we saw afterwards we met with a few others of the same kind but they were far from common being winter the tree had no leaves but in their place numberless threads by which the various offerings such as cigars bread meat pieces of cloth c had been suspended poor people not having any thing better only pulled a thread out of their ponchos and fastened it to the tree the indians moreover were accustomed to pour spirits and maté into a certain hole and likewise to smoke upwards thinking thus to afford all possible gratification to walleechu to complete the scene the tree was surrounded by the bleached bones of the horses which had been slaughtered as sacrifices all indians of every age and sex made their offerings they then thought that their horses would not tire and that they themselves should be prosperous the gaucho who told me this said that in the time of peace he had witnessed this scene and that he and others used to wait till the indians had passed by for the sake of stealing their offerings from walleechu the gauchos think that the indians consider the tree as the god itself but it seems far more probable that they regard it as the altar the only cause which i can imagine for this choice is its being a landmark in a dangerous passage the sierra de la ventana is visible at an immense distance and a gaucho told me that he was once riding with an indian a few miles to the north of the rio colorado when the latter commenced making the same loud noise which is usual at the first sight of the distant tree putting his hand to his head and then pointing it in the direction of the sierra upon being asked the reason of this the indian said in broken spanish first see the sierra this likewise would render it probable that the utility of a distant landmark is the first cause of its adoration about two leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night at this instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynxeyed gauchos off they set in chase and in a few minutes she was dragged in by the lazo and slaughtered we here had the four necessaries of life en el campopasture for the horses water only a muddy puddle meat and firewood the gauchos were in high spirits at finding all these luxuries and we soon set to work at the poor cow this was the first night which i had ever passed under the open sky with the gear of the recado for my bed there is high enjoyment in the independence of the gaucho lifeto be able at any moment to pull up your horse and say here we will pass the night the deathlike stillness of the plain the dogs keeping watch the gipsygroup of gauchos making their beds round the fire have left in my mind a stronglymarked picture of this first night which will not soon be forgotten the next day the country continued similar to that above described it is inhabited by few birds or animals occasionally a deer or a guanaco wild llama may be seen but the agouti cavia patagonica is the commonest quadruped this animal here represents our hares it differs however from that genus in many essential respects for instance it has only three toes behind it is also nearly twice the size weighing from twenty to twentyfive pounds the agouti is a true friend to the desert it is a common feature in the landscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a straight line across these wild plains on the eastern side of america their northern limit is formed by the sierra tapalguen lat where the plains rather suddenly become greener and more humid the limit certainly depends on this change for near mendoza lat which is much further north but where the country is very sterile i again met the agouti it is not evident by what circumstances their southern limit is governed it occurs between port desire and st julian about where there is no change in the kind of land and only a trifling and gradual one of temperature it is a singular fact that although the agouti is not now found so far south as port st julian yet that captain wood in his voyage in talks of them as being numerous there what cause can have altered in a wide uninhabited and rarelyvisited country the range of an animal like this it appears also from the number shot in one day at port desire that they must have been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present azara states that the agouti never excavates its own burrow but uses that of the bizcacha wherever this animal is present without doubt this is true but on the sandy plains of bahia blanca where the bizcacha is not found the gauchos maintain that the agouti is its own workman the same thing occurs with the little owls of the pampas noctua cunicularia which have so often been described as standing like sentinels at the mouths of the burrows for in banda oriental owing to the absence of the bizcacha they are obliged to hollow out their own habitations azara also says that the agouti except when pressed by danger does not enter its burrow on this point i must again differ from that high authority at bahia blanca i have repeatedly seen two or three of these animals sitting on their haunches by the mouths of their holes which as i passed by at a distance they quietly entered daily in the neighbourhood of these spots the agouti were abundant but differently from most burrowing animals it wanders commonly two or three together to miles or leagues from its home nor do i know whether it returns at night the agouti feeds and roams about by day is shy and watchful does not squat or so rarely that i never saw an instance of this it cannot run very fast and therefore is frequently caught by a couple of dogs even of mixed breed its manner of running more resembles that of a rabbit than of a hare the agouti generally produces two young ones at a birth which are brought forth within the burrow the flesh when cooked is very white it is however rather tasteless and dry the next morning as we approached the rio colorado the appearance of the country changed we soon came on a plain covered with turf which from its flowers tall clover and little owls resembled the pampas we passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent which in summer dries and becomes incrusted with various salts and hence is called a salitral it was covered by low succulent plants of the same kind with those growing on the seashore the colorado at the pass where we crossed it is only about sixty yards wide generally it must be nearly double that width its course is very tortuous being marked by willowtrees and beds of reeds in a direct line the distance to the mouth of the river is said to be nine leagues but by water twentyfive we were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense troops of mares which were swimming the river in order to follow a division of troops into the interior a more ludicrous spectacle i never beheld than the hundreds of heads all directed one way with pointed ears and distended nostrils appearing just above the water like a great shoal of some amphibious animals mares flesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition this gives them a very great facility of movement for the distance to which horses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising i have been assured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for many days successively the encampment of general rosas was close to the river it consisted of a square formed by waggons artillery straw huts c the soldiers were nearly all cavalry and i should think such a villanous bandittilike army was never before collected together the greater number of men were of a mixed breed between negro indian and spaniard i know not the reason but men of such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance i called on the secretary to show my passport he began to crossquestion me in the most dignified and mysterious manner by good luck i had a letter of recommendation from the government of buenos ayres to the commandant of patagones this was taken to general rosas who sent me a very obliging message and the secretary returned all smiles and graciousness we took up our residence in the rancho or hovel of a curious old spaniard who had served with napoleon in the expedition against russia we staid two days at the colorado i had little to do for the surrounding country was a swamp which in summer december when the snow melts on the cordillera is overflowed by the river my chief amusement was watching the indian families as they came to buy little articles at the rancho where we staid it was supposed that general rosas had about six hundred indian allies the men were a tall fine race yet it was afterwards easy to see in the fuegian savage the same countenance rendered hideous by cold want of food and less civilization some authors in defining the primary races of mankind have separated these indians into two classes but i cannot think this is correct among the young women or chinas some deserve to be called even beautiful their hair was coarse but bright and black and they wore it in two plaits hanging down to the waist they had a high colour and eyes that glistened with brilliancy their legs feet and arms were small and elegantly formed their ankles and sometimes their waists were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads nothing could be more interesting than some of the family groups a mother with one or two daughters would often come to our rancho mounted on the same horse they ride like men but with their knees tucked up much higher this habit perhaps arises from their being accustomed when travelling to ride the loaded horses the duty of the women is to load and unload the horses to make the tents for the night in short to be like the wives of all savages useful slaves the men fight hunt take care of the horses and make the riding gear one of their chief indoor occupations is to knock two stones together till they become round the bolas is a very important weapon to the indian for with it he catches his game and also his horse which roams free over the plain in fighting his first attempt is to throw the horse of his adversary with the bolas and when entangled by the fall to kill him with the chuzo if the balls only catch the neck or body of an animal they are often carried away and lost as the making the stones round is the labour of two days the manufacture of the balls is a very common employment several of the men and women had their faces painted red but i never saw the horizontal bands which are so common among the fuegians their chief pride consists in having every thing made of silver i have seen a cacique with his spurs stirrups handle of his knife and bridle made of this metal the head stall and reins being of wire were not thicker than whipcord and to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a chain gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance general rosas intimated a wish to see me a circumstance which i was afterwards very glad of he is a man of an extraordinary character and has a most predominant influence in the country which it seems probable he will use to its prosperity and advancement he is said to be the owner of seventyfour square leagues of land and to have about three hundred thousand head of cattle his estates are admirably managed and are far more productive of corn than any others he first gained his celebrity by his laws for his own estancias and by disciplining several hundred men so as to resist with success the attacks of the indians there are many stories current about the rigid manner in which his laws were enforced one of these was that no man on penalty of being put into the stocks should carry his knife on a sunday this day being the principal one for gambling and drinking many quarrels arose which from the general manner of fighting with the knife often proved fatal one sunday the governor came in great form to pay the estancia a visit and general rosas in his hurry walked out to receive him with his knife as usual stuck in his belt the steward touched his arm and reminded him of the law upon which turning to the governor he said he was extremely sorry but that he must go into the stocks and that till let out he possessed no power even in his own house after a little time the steward was persuaded to open the stocks and to let him out but no sooner was this done than he turned to the steward and said you now have broken the laws so you must take my place in the stocks such actions as these delighted the gauchos who all possess high notions of their own equality and dignity general rosas is also a perfect horsemanan acomplishment of no small consequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by the following trial a troop of unbroken horses being driven into a corral were let out through a gateway above which was a crossbar it was agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild animals as it rushed out and should be able without saddle or bridle not only to ride it but also to bring it back to the door of the corral should be their general the person who succeeded was accordingly elected and doubtless made a fit general for such an army this extraordinary feat has also been performed by rosas by these means and by conforming to the dress and habits of the gauchos he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country and in consequence a despotic power i was assured by an english merchant that a man who had murdered another when arrested and questioned concerning his motive answered he spoke disrespectfully of general rosas so i killed him at the end of a week the murderer was at liberty this doubtless was the act of the generals party and not of the general himself in conversation he is enthusiastic sensible and very grave his gravity is carried to a high pitch i heard one of his mad buffoons for he keeps two like the barons of old relate the following anecdote i wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music so i went to the general two or three times to ask him he said to me go about your business for i am engaged i went a second time he said if you come again i will punish you a third time i asked and he laughed i rushed out of the tent but it was too late he ordered two soldiers to catch and stake me i begged by all the saints in heaven he would let me off but it would not dowhen the general laughs he spares neither mad man or sound the poor flighty gentleman looked quite dolorous at the very recollection of the staking this is a very severe punishment four posts are driven into the ground and the man is extended by his arms and legs horizontally and there left to stretch for several hours the idea is evidently taken from the usual method of drying hides my interview passed away without a smile and i obtained a passport and order for the government posthorses and this he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner in the morning we started for bahia blanca which we reached in two days leaving the regular encampment we passed by the toldos of the indians these are round like ovens and covered with hides by the mouth of each a tapering chuzo was stuck in the ground the toldos were divided into separate groups which belonged to the different caciques tribes and the groups were again divided into smaller ones according to the relationship of the owners for several miles we travelled along the valley of the colorado the alluvial plains on the side appeared fertile and it is supposed that they are well adapted to the growth of corn turning northward from the river we soon entered on a country differing from those plains that extend south of the river the land still continued dry and sterile but it supported many different kinds of plants and the grass though brown and withered was more abundant as the thorny bushes were less so these latter in a short space entirely disappeared and the plains were left without a thicket to cover their nakedness this change in the vegetation marks the commencement of the grand calcareoargillaceous deposit which i have already noticed as forming the wide extent of the pampas and as covering the granitic rocks of banda oriental from the strait of magellan to the colorado a distance of about eight hundred miles the face of the country is every where composed of shingle the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry and probably owe their origin to the rocks of the cordillera north of the colorado the bed thins out and the pebbles become exceedingly small and here the characteristic vegetation of patagonia ceases having ridden about twentyfive miles we came to a broad belt of sanddunes which stretch as far as
