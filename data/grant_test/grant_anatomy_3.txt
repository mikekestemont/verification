in fig which are broadest at the circumference and become narrower as they approach the centre where there is commonly a small hole fig b b these bodies are therefore concave both on their anterior and posterior surfaces and when applied to each other they leave large intevertebral spaces between them which are filled up each with a short sac of a gelatinous thin fluid as seen in fig c c so that these vertebrae play freely over the surface of so many elastic interposed balls the bodies of the vertebrae are the elements first developed in the animal kingdom they are the most important as means of support they are the parts most developed in the vertebrae of fishes and the skeletons of the lowest cartilaginous species are com posed almost solely of these elements even in the sharks the other elements are remarkably small and are not ajichy losed to the bodies of the vertebrae so that by macera tion they fall off and leave deep depressions fig b c in the sides of the cyclovertebral elements where they were attached by the great size of the central passage in the bodies of the vertebrae of many cartila ginous fishes the intervertebral substances communicate with each other and form a continuous elastic beaded chord passing through the whole vertebral column as in the lampreys the component elements of the vertebrae of fishes are disposed in such a manner as to give great vertical extension to the trunk and thus to form a broad lateral surface to strike the water in their horizontal mode of progression as the spinal chord is small the upper vertebral foramen is also small in fishes and the two superior laminae therefore soon meet to form a spinous process by their junction as seen in the skeleton of the perch fig cc c along the greater portion of the back we observe the two epivertebral elements fig placed end to end in a vertical direction the short inferior portion forming the interspinous bone and the more slender superior portion extending from the trunk and covered with a prolonged fold of the skin forms a ray of the dorsal fin and thus are con structed all the dorsal fins placed along the middle of the back from the head to the tail the same two ele ments in several of the last cocygeal vertebrae pass back wards in a very oblique manner and constitute the cau dal fin the corresponding elements below the bodies of the vertebrae occupy the same relative position wherever there are anal fins developed between the tail and the anus as at a j the inferior foramen of the vertebrae for the blood vessel is larger than that above for the spinal chord and it widens much in the pelvic region in order to embrace the posterior parts of the urinary and genital organs the elements of the cocygeal vertebras of fishes being thus extended upwards and downwards they present no transverse processes in that region to impede the lateral motions of the tail and their nervous and vascular systems are here protected from injury during the violent actions of that part of the body in the region of the abdomen the inferior interspinous bones and the rays are placed at the ends of the trans verse processes and extended more or less round the viscera as ribs which often present a bifurcated ap pearance by their sending a long process outwards and backwards the ribs are often merely minute epiphyses at the ends of the transverse processes as in the rays and sharks and they are continued forwards along the vertebral column to the atlas so that there are no dis tinct free cervical vertebras the bodies of the cranical vertebrae continue along the floor of the cranium through the basilar part of the occipital bone the body of the sphenoid the ethmoid and the vomer and these parts are here extended forward in the same straight line with the rest of the vertebral column the ordinary concave ends of the bodies of the vertebrae can be traced for ward to a variable extent through those of the cranium as at both ends of the basilar portion of the occipital and of the body of the spenoid the bones of the cranium in osseous fishes are generally thin diaphanous elastic united by squamous sutures they present a large exterior surface for the attachment of the powerful muscles of the trunk and they continue to grow and to preserve the same proportions to the rest of the skeleton through life the interior of the large cranical cavity is filled chiefly by the soft cellular tissue of the arachnoid coat the brain occupying but a small portion of the base of the skull the number of distinct osseous pieces in the composition of the skull is greatest in fishes and they correspond nearly with the theory of this part of the ske leton being composed of seven vertebrae each consisting as usual of a body with four elements above and four elements below the number of separate pieces diminishes as we ascend through the vertebrated classes by the early and permanent anchylosis of a variable number of these elements common to all forms of crania the spine of the occipital bone or the superior oc cipital is here large for muscular attachments like that of the vertebrae of the trunk and this ridge is often continued forward over the whole skull to the nose from the horizontal position of the head on the trunk the occipitals and the frontals generally meet and force the parietals to assume a lateral position as we see in the skulls of cetacea for the same reason the ele ments of the temporal bone are large detached and mostly moveable the petrous portion is exterior to the organ of hearing in the osseous fishes and surrounds that organ imbedding it in its substance in the cartila ginous species as in higher classes the principal frontal bones i are long and bounded before and laterally by the anterior frontals and on the posterior and lateral part by the posterior frontals as in other oviparous vertebrata the jugal is generally long curved and slender as in the blowing cetacea and composed of a series of separate pieces which bound the inferior margin of the orbit they form the suborbital bones of cuvier the detached condition of the bones of the head is most remarkable in those of the anterior part of the face where the palatine bones extending longitudinally on the sides of the mouth and often covered with teeth as in serpents are freely moveable the superior maxilla ries extending downwards laterally behind the inter maxillaries on each side of the face are loosely ar ticulated to the vomer and to the palatine bones and are freely moveable in the osseous fishes as are also the intennaxillaries which bound the fore part of the upper jaw the lower jaw is generally composed of at least two pieces on each side the dental portion in front containing the teeth and the articular portion behind connected with the head by a tympanic bone below considered by cuvier as the jugal fishes have teeth implanted in almost every bone around the interior of the mouth in the intermaxillary superior and inferior maxillary bones on the branchial arches pharyn geal bones palatine bones os hyoides and on the tongue itself the teeth are almost entirely osseous without fangs and without alveoli irregular in size and position generally recurved spines placed in numerous rows and they often become anchylosed to the bones which sup port them their soft osseous texture their thin cover ing of enamel and their feeble attachment correspond with the soft condition and the imperfect union of the bones which support these prehensile teeth as we see also in amphibia and serpents where the bones of the head which support them are strong and firmly united as in crocodilian reptiles and mammalia the teeth are more dense covered with a thicker layer of enamel provided with fangs and lodged in deep alveoli behind the lower jaw is placed the operculum consisting of a large opercular bone a subopercular bone an inter opercular bone and often an additional small piece below the subopercular as fishes have no tympanic cavity of the ear to confine their ossicula auditus the opercular bone is considered as an enlarged stapes the subopercular bone as the os orbiculare the interoper cular as the malleus and the fourth small bone as the iocus these are placed behind the preopercular bone and have been also regarded by some as elements of the lower jaw the arches which hang down from the sides of the vertebral column are more like ribs in fishes than in higher classes as the lower jaw the os hyoides the sca pular arch and that of the pelvis the os hyoides is very large here as in all waterbreathing vertebrata from its supporting the branchial arches it consists of five pairs of pieces besides the body or lingual bone it is suspended from the temporal bones and it is chiefly by its motions backwards and forwards that respiration is effected not only in fishes but in amphibia and chelonia it forms the second arch below the head between the arch formed by the lower jaw and that formed by the scapular and coracoid bones its sides support the four pairs of branchial arches the analogues of tracheal rings and its exterior gives at tachment to the branchiostegous rays of the opercular membrane the arms of fishes or their pectoral fins are almost always more developed than their legs or ventral fins and they are generally attached to the back part of the skull by means of an osseous arch composed behind of the two scapulse and before of the two coracoid bones in the perch fig the two highest or first portions of this arch on each side and are regarded as the scapulae the long angular bone attached to these as the humerus the two succeeding bones as the ulna and the radius to these succeed the bones of the carpus and this member is terminated by the long and nu merous phalanges of the fingers the small styliform ter mination of the scapular arch composed sometimes of one and sometimes as in the perch of two pieces is considered as the coracoid bone and they occasion ally meet in front as in higher oviparous classes though without the intervention of a sternum the relative mag nitude of the arms of fishes and their constancy compared with the posterior members corresponds with their great size in the embryo of higher classes and their preceding the legs in their development from the trunk the posterior members the legs or the ventral fins of fishes are unconnected with the vertebral column suspended from two riblike iliac bones and placed on the lower part of the trunk sometimes near the anus sometimes near the head or between these two parts the iliac bones not being here attached to the vertebral column there is no portion of that column fixed to form a sacrum and the same is observed in the cetacea and the perennibranchiate am phibia where there is no sacrum and the whole column behind the head is thus free for the extensive motion re quired in swimming these two pelvic bones are sometimes closely applied to each other extend along the middle of the abdominal surface like two pubic bones and are attached to the scapular arch or to the humeri as in the perch in the apodal fishes as the eels the pelvic bones are wanting as well as the legs and in the abdominal fishes the pelvic bones are quite unconnected with the skeleton from this freedom of the posterior members in fishes they are most frequently placed forward near the head where they afford least impediment to the lateral motions of the vertebral column the long pha langes of the feet are attached directly to the pelvic bones there being seldom a trace of the intermediate bones of the legs developed in this class where they are not required either to give support to the trunk or mobility to the feet in the plagiostome cartilaginous fishes the highest ani mals of this class the ribs and the spinous processes of the vertebrae of the trunk are as little developed as in am phibia many of the anterior vertebrae e of the trunk are often anchylosed and the whole bones of the cranium are united into a single piece as seen in the skeleton of the common skate raia betis fig the skull is of great size with tough thick cartilaginous pa rietes it is filled chiefly with the soft glary arachnoid tissue and contains within the thick ness of the temporal bone the whole of the internal ear from each side of the head there passes down a short round moveable piece in the situation of the tympanic bone which supports the lower jaw d and the moveable free upper jaw c both covered closely with small teeth like mosaic work the scapular arch is fixed to the anterior thick anchylosed portion e of the vertebral column and the bones of the arms are also anchylosed together and to this scapular arch this fish lies at the bottom without an airbag its motions therefore in swimming being chiefly vertical its hands g g are very large and extended nearly round the whole trunk from the point of the nose to the pelvic arch h in the large hands of the rays and sharks there are not only very numerous fingers or rays but each finger g is divided into a variable number of short cylindrical phalanges slightly dilated at their points of contact the pelvic arch h is generally very perfect in the plagiostome chondropterygii and presents the rudiments of the three ordinary con stituent bones the ilium the ischium and the pubis on each side the two pubic bones united form a band passing transversely before the anus the iliac bones ascend taper ing to near the sides of the column and the ischium on each side passes backwards the feet are less than the hands and consist of toes i i which are shorter less numerous and less divided than the fingers g the great size of the hand is the more required in the rays from the smallness of the tail rendering it almost use less as an organ of motion in the swordfish and in the sawfish the upper jaw bones the vomer and the nasal bones form a long projecting weapon of offence extending from the face above the free intermaxillaries which bound the upper part of the mouth the orbits are prolonged laterally to a great distance in the zycena or hammerheaded shark so as to give a pedunculated appearance to the eyes from the softness of the skeleton in the cartilaginous fishes the mouth and especially the lower jaw is very short and often extended much transversely and for the same reason these animals have numerous rows of teeth prepared to supply the places of those which are successively lost as in the sharks or have their jaws covered as in the rays with a continuous compact layer of small permanent teeth xx amphibia the amphibious or batrachian animals commence their career as fishes with one auricle and one ventricle and breathing by means of gills which in many are retained through life but in their adult state they ac quire a pulmonic respiration arid a pulmonic auricle of the heart and this early aquatic life and subsequent meta morphosis affect the whole condition of the skeleton and the forms of the several bones the skeletons of the am phibia come nearest to those of fishes in the imperfect ossification and the thin diaphanous elastic character of the bones in the loose condition of the bones of the face and in the imperfect development of the ribs the perennibranchiate amphibia and the tadpoles of the caducibranchiate species present the softest and the most detached condition of the bones and the most fishlike form of the whole skeleton their vertebral column is prolonged backwards to a great extent as an organ of motion their arms and legs are wanting or are very imperfectly developed and their os hyoides like that of a fish supports a variable number of branchial arches as seen in the annexed figure of the skeleton of the proteus anguinus fig the ver tebrse here have the bodies terminated before and behind by concave surfaces as in fishes and all the processes of these vertebrae are short to allow of extensive motion especially in a lateral direction there is no sacrum and the pelvic and scapular arches are as free as in fishes a few small de tached points of bone at the ends of the transverse processes of some of the anterior dorsal vertebrae are the only ribs here developed and in this as in many other characters the pro teus and the siren resemble the sharks the parietal e and the frontal bones are long and separate the tympanic bone is long and moveable the wide inferior jaws the long in termaxillaries and the loose upper jawbones are provided with sharp recurved conical teeth the body and cornua a of the os hyoides are proportionally large and support the three branchial arches c on each side to which the permanent gills d are attached the flat dorsal portion of the scapula is thin and cartilaginous and the coracoid pieces meet in front by broad extended edges there are only three toes h developed on the fore feet the two inner consisting of three phalanges and the outer of two and on the hind feet there are only two toes i each consisting of three bones the expanded cartilaginous iliac bones extend upwards to the sides of the vertebral column as in the plagiostome fishes without being attached to a sacrum and the pubic bones unite with each other and with the ischia to form a transverse anterior band for the support of the small legs the condition of all parts of the skeleton is nearly the same in the siren lacertina where the prolonged fishlike vertebral column has still greater freedom of motion from the entire want of legs and a pelvic arch the spinous processes of the vertebse are more elevated the coracoid bones meet by a longer sur face the hands have four toes there are four branchial arches on each side the body and cornua of the os hyoides are very large and the tympanic and intermaxillary bones are as moveable as in a fish the ribs are developed to a greater extent in the land salamander where they have the form of straight tapering spines extending from the trans verse processes of all the vertebrae of the trunk the arms and legs which here support the trunk in a lighter me dium than in the former animals have all their bones larger and stronger and have four toes before and behind the whole bones of the skull and face are more fixed in their articulations and the pelvic arch is more connected with the sides of the vertebral column but without forming a sacrum it is however in the anurous amphibia as the common frog fig that we find the most solid and fixed con dition of all the bones and the nearest approach to rep tiles and higher classes in the structure of the different parts of the skeleton the vertebra of the tadpole are formed like those of a fish with two cuplike cavities but by the ossification and anchylosis of the intervertebral soft substance it becomes fixed to the posterior end of the body of each vertebra so as to change their forms almost to those of reptiles a great portion of their vertebral column and of their os hyoides and their branchial arches become absorbed their legs and arms become developed and many of the coccygeal vertebrae unite to form a single piece so that these anurous highest kinds of amphibia pass through the inferior forms of their class before arriving at their perfect state there are nine vertebrae in the frog fig the first of which b has a double articular sur face like two condy loid depressions for the two prominent condyles formed by the body of the occipital bone a and this atlas is without transverse processes the bodies of the succeeding ver tebrae terminate pos teriorly by slightly con vex surfaces and an teriorly by correspond ing depressions and the transverse pro cesses are long but irregular in their forms and magnitude there are no ribs and the pelvic arch is moveably connected with the ends of the transverse processes of the last or ninth vertebra c c this single vertebra forms therefore a true sacrum and the succeeding coccygeal vertebrae d are anchylosed into a single unperforated bone slightly grooved at its commencement running along the dorsal part of the pelvis and entirely concealed within this part of the trunk the two iliac bones e e long cylindrical and slightly curved extend backwards from the sides of the sacrum c c to the ossa ischii f behind and the small pubic bones in front and these three bones united by sutures form on each side of this compressed terminal part of the pelvis the cotyloid cavity for the reception of the head of the femur the legs are here very large both for leaping and swimming the long femur is suc ceeded by another long single bone w m the grooved surface of which shows it to be formed of the tibia and fibula anchylosed together to this succeeds a lengthened astragulus and calcaneum n then three very minute cunei form bones of the tarsus and then the lengthened bones of the meta tarsus and the phalanges of the five toes o the humeri a a are comparatively short strong and slightly bent the radius and the ulna i i are anchylosed like the tibia and fibula and the six small carpal bones k k are succeeded by four long metacarpal bones the phalanges of four fingers and a small rudiment internally of a fifth the scapular apparatus fig for the support of the arms is here very complete and also the sternum although there are no ribs to reach it the posterior curved portions t of the scapulae are thin and cartilaginous as in many fishes and reptiles and the anterior parts ff y which chiefly contribute to the formation of the glenoid cavity k k for the head of the humerus is strong and ossified from the gle noid cavity on each side proceeds inwards the coracoid bone e e which expands as it reaches the sternum d above the two coracoid bones e e are the two slender cla vicles c c which also proceed from the glenoid cavities to the sternum and leave a considerable vacant space between them and the coracoid bones the anterior a and the posterior h portions of the sternum are thin flexible car tilaginous laminae and the intermediate parts are ossified and strong for the insertion of muscles the support of the scapular arch and the protection of the fore part of the trunk the upper thin portion appears to consist of the two episternal pieces the next part b of the two hyo sternal elements the next d the single entosternal to which both the clavicles and coracoid bones are attached the next t the two hyposternal elements and the inferior thin cartilaginous terminal piece h the two united xiphi sternal elements which usually terminate this bone the bones of the head even in the highest of the caduci branchiate amphibia are still as loosely united together as in most of the osseous fishes as is seen in the skull of the common frog rana esculenta fig the occipital bone has its basilar part divided by a vertical suture and is se curely united to the atlas by two prominent condyles b b belonging to that portion of the bone the parietals c c are long narrow near ly separated by a sagittal suture arid extend forward over a large portion of this lengthened narrow cranium as we see also in ophidian and saurian reptiles the sphenoid bone has also a very lengthened form along the base of the skull as in fishes on the fore part of the skull are the two posterior frontals a separate in the young frogs but united into a single bone extended between the parietals c c and the two anterior frontals h h which extend laterally to the two pterygoid and the two upper jawbones k the two intermaxillary bones the two upper jaws k k and two bones behind these regarded as divisions of the vomer are provided with small sharp recurved conical teeth although none are found opposed to them in the lower jaw the slender jugal bone o is ex tended from the upper jaw bone backwards and downwards to the lower end of the long tympanic which is here moveable as in most oviparous vertebrata the tympanic bone n here as in most of the lower vertebrata sends down a condyloid process to be articulated with a glenoid cavity on the back part of the lower jaw the lower jaw is divided at the symphisis and each lateral portion consists of an anterior s a middle r and a posterior piece which extend to a great distance transversely and are en tirely destitute of teeth although there are teeth in the lower jaw of the salamander and the proteus as we pro ceed upwards through the vertebrated classes the teeth become more circumscribed in their number and in their distribution over the parietes of the mouth till we find them confined to a single row disposed along the upper and lower jaws we thus observe in the adult anurous amphibia a greater consolidation of the whole texture of the bones and of the different parts of the skeleton than we find in fishes and many elements originally separate have become anchylosed together which conditions prepare the solid framework to support and carry the whole fabric through a much rarer medium than the dense water in which they commenced their career and in which the fishes perma nently reside xxi reptilia the bones of serpents are more com pact white dense and elastic than those of the other orders of reptiles but their skeleton is the most deficient in its parts consisting almost solely of the vertebral column without legs or arms or a pelvic or scapular arch or even a sternum to connect the ribs as seen in the skeleton of the boa constrictor fig j with this simple skeleton they are able to creep quickly on the ground to combat with their prey to climb trees to spring into the air and to swim rivers and lakes the ribs are developed from the sides of the vertebral column from the atlas to the anus and the transverse processes continue to extend to a considerable length from the sides of many of the anterior coccygeal vertebrae from the absence of a sternum in front and the free articulation of the ribs with the ends of the transverse processes of the vertebrae the ribs possess the means of extensive motion and cause the transverse scuta on the lower surface of the abdomen to move like so many feet the ribs of serpents are tubular with thin compact parietes and containing a soft cancellated structure in their interior by which they possess great elasticity and strength they are narrow and compressed from before backwards strong and broad at their head and neck and taper regularly to their free ventral extremity where they generally terminate with a thin flexible cartilaginous prolongation their head presents a broad arched concave surface to form a secure and free articulation with the rounded prominent transverse processes of the vertebrae the broad and long transverse processes in the coccygeal region of the column cover a long pelvic cavity in the male in which the two divisions of the penis are lodged in their retracted state as the ribs ex tend along the whole sides of the trunk from the head to the anus there are no cervical nor lumbar vertebrae and as there are no legs nor pelvis there is no sacrum the vertebrae are here more numerous than in any other class of animals so that there is great flexibility of the whole body and their articulations are remarkably secure from the extent and the number of the articular surfaces between each pair of vertebras all the processes of these vertebrae are short to admit of greater freedom of motion ex cepting the four articular processes which are very broad to give a greater security of attachment and hence the quadran gular or cubical form presented by the vertebrae of serpentsas seen in the front view of those of the boa constrictor fig the lower part of the body of each vertebra terminates in a large oblique hemispherical convexity a smooth on the surface and covered with a thin layer of cartilage this prominent end of the vertebra is received into a corres ponding deep cuplike cavity b with sharp margins and lined with carti lage at the anterior end of the next succeeding vertebra and this regular ballandsocket form of articulation is continued through the whole vertebral column these articulations are se cured by strong capsular ligaments and lubricated by a copious secretion of synovia the two anterior and the two posterior arti cular processes present broad flat surfaces extended trans versely those of the anterior vertebra passing over those of the next succeeding vertebra as in other classes the shortness of the transverse processes fig c c cc allows of a greater extent of lateral motion in the column and for the same reason the vertebral foramina for the spinal chord are most dilated before and behind in that direction these very short strong transverse processes have each a large convex prominent articular surface ex tending downwards inwards and a little forwards which is received into the articular concavity of the head of the rib from the four articular processes of the vertebrae extending to a great distance laterally in a straight and horizontal direction they give great extent and safety to those lateral motions which are chiefly required in the trunk of serpents the bodies of the dorsal vertebras are cari nated below and have a narrow contracted neck at the base of the posterior hemispherical articular tubercle the laminae are here very strong and evasated before and behind to enlarge the two ends of each vertebral foramen that the spinal chord may not be pressed upon during the mo tions of the vertebrae the spmous processes are short strong and broad from before backwards so as to afford a strong attachment to the muscles without interfering with the motions of the vertebrae in the skulls of reptiles as in fishes and amphibia we still find the cranial vertebrae disposed in the same straight line as those of the rest of the column and most of the elements of the cranial bones still remain separate through life the serpents and lizards present the most detached condition of all these cranial bones met with in the class of reptiles the crocodilian animals and the chelonia have them the most firmly united by sutures this loose state of the bones of the head is the more necessary in serpents which from the want of arms and legs to hold down their prey and assist in its subdivision are compelled to swallow it entire the annexed figure of the skull of the python fig shows the most common disposition and form of the bones of the head of serpents the basilar portion a of the occipital bone remains distinctly isolated from the two lateral condyloid pieces and these three elements form the large transversely elongated occipital condyle the basilar element forming the greater portion of it the superior or median occipital is here small and detached as in the saurian reptiles the parietal bones c c are long and anchylosed together along the median line to afford a solid unyielding covering to the lengthened brain beneath them these two bones are thus early united in most other reptiles in all birds and in the greater number even of the mammalia although they are separate in the normal form of the human skull this condition of the two pari etals is the more required in serpents from the loose state of most of the other bones of the head and the exposure of these animals to the trampling of qua drupeds and other dangers while they lie concealed in their natu ral haunts the anchylosis of the two parietal s gives greater security to the strong temporal muscles of these animals as in other classes where this solidity of attachment is required from the length and the loose attach ment of the squamous portion e of the temporal bone to the parietals the tympanic bone and consequently the lower jaw has much greater ex tent of motion in a lateral direction the two anterior i i the two middle h h and the two posterior k k frontals remain detached and form as in other reptiles the greater portion of the front of the skull the great breadth of the two lachrymal and of the two nasal p p bones corresponds with the general flat and broad form of the head of serpents the two upper jawbones m m and the two intermaxillaries q are separate and quite moveable on the surrounding bones and the two palatines are also moveable and long and support the most permanent teeth of these animals the two sides of the lower jaw are quite detached from each other and freely moveable at the sym phesis and the pieces of which it is composed are also moveable this freedom of motion of the lower jaw g t extends through the long tympanic and squamous e elements of the temporal bone to its more fixed petrous portion so that the mouth is here capable of extraordinary dilation to transmit through its cavity entire prey which the serpents have not the means of dividing their teeth are organs of prehension and not of mastica tion they are conical slender sharp recurved osseous spines covered with enamel with very shallow alveoli placed along the upper and lower jaws the intermaxillaries and the palatine bones the upper jaw bones in the poi sonous snakes terminate abruptly in a round peduncle below and before the orbits which supports the tubular poison fang and the small teeth which usually accompany it upon each side of the head the saurian reptiles have the skeleton more complete than the serpents as they possess a complex sternum and scapular apparatus a fixed pelvis together with atlantal and sacral extremities but the transition from the one form is very gradual from the serpents with the rudiments of pelvic and scapular bones to the bimanous and the biped lizards and from these to the regular saurians with fore feet and to the more solid and complete forms of the skeleton presented by the crocodilian reptiles by the increased development of all the processes of the vertebral column we perceive the preparation for more solidity in the articulations and more limited motions in that part of the skeleton the loco motion is now to be effected by the arms and legs and not by the vertebral column as in most of the lower vertebrata the large bones of the sauria present a coarse fibrous struc ture contain a large proportion of animal matter and have a cancellated loose texture internally where we find tubular cavities in the birds and mammalia the bodies of the ver tebrae in the lacertine sauria preserve the ballandsocket joint throughout the column but these parts of the verte brae are more compressed and the articulations are more oblique than in the serpents from the necessity for sup porting the trunk upon the legs the pelvis is united firmly to a sacrum consisting generally of only two enlarged ver tebrae the bodies of the vertebrae are generally more lengthened and the articular processes more extended in a longitudinal direction than in the serpents there are two concave surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae of the gecko as in fishes and tadpoles and in the ichthyosaurus in the coccygeal vertebrae besides the lengthened superior spinous process and the two transverse processes there are inferior spinous processes which are interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae and by forming a small arch they give protection to the large bloodvessels of the tail which is generally a thick muscular continuation of the trunk there are false ribs in front of the true as well as behind them as we see also in birds and in some mam malia and there are generally about seven cervical vertebrae as in quadrupeds the head is extended forwards in the same straight line with the vertebral column as in the inferior vertebrated classes as in these inferior classes also we observe the bones of the head of the lacertine rep tiles remarkably loose and moveable in their articulations as seen in this figure of the skull of the lacerta nilotica cuv fig the occipital bone as in the serpents has its transversely elongated condyle composed chiefly of the basilar portion of that bone exterior to the two condyloid pieces g a of the occipital are the long slen der curved squamous and mastoid m ele ments of the temporal bone almost as loose as in serpents and giving support to the short and moveable tympanic por tion r of that bone to which the articular portion of the lower jaw is attached the two parietals n are anchylosed together as in serpents and support the posterior edges of the two middle frontals c c the anterior e e and the posterior i i frontals form the upper boundary of the large birdlike orbits the petrous portion p p of the temporal bone is here the largest and strongest element extending forwards to the sphenoid s s and backwards to the very long and slender squamous and mastoid m portions the two lachrymal bones extend less over the face than in serpents and between them and the an terior frontals e e are the superciliary bones h h as in birds the upper jaw bones d d and the intermaxillaries a are more fixed than in the former order of reptiles and these intermaxillaries are often anchylosed together as are also the two narrow lengthened nasal bones b the large inferior turbinated bones are here exposed from the small ness of the anchylosed nasal bone the palatine bones are more fixed than in serpents and are destitute of teeth and the two pterygoid bones v extend as in serpents back wards and outwards to the tympanic r the lower jaw is divided at the symphysis and consists on each side of six pieces of which the anterior or dental portion is the largest and the prehensile teeth are here as loosely attached by their expanded base to the alveolar flat surface of the jaw as in serpents protected at their bases by an outer and sometimes an interior ridge of the dental bone but not lodged in separate alveoli the osseous bases of these teeth in the lizards often anchylose to the surface of the jaws as in fishes and the new teeth generally rise up on the inner side of the base of the old or of the lost and not in the interior of their cavity as they do in the croco diles the ribs of lizards are for the most part rounded and slender and without the tubercle so much developed in quadrupeds and birds the scapula is thin broad and curved the coracoid also terminates in front by a very broad curved margin by which it unites to the large ento sternal piece the acromion is a distinct bone of very variable size and form and the clavicles are anchylosed and extended in form of a cross along the fore part of the ster num the sternal elements are thin soft and extended transversely and have chiefly the entosternal enlarged and strong as in birds the humerus also as in birds is much expanded at its upper and lower extremities the ulna is much stronger than the radius and distant from it espe cially at the carpus there are nine bones in the carpus as in tortoises the three pelvic bones contribute to the formation of the cotyloid cavity for the head of the femur the expanded edges of the ossa pubis and ossa ischii meet and form a lengthened symphysis on the median line in front and the spine of the iliac bones is extended not for wards as in higher classes but backwards along each side of the sacrum towards the coccygeal vertebrse the head of the femur is compressed and bent forward and the great trochanter is also compressed and turned towards the tibia the patella is always small the tibia short strong thick at its ends and much curved at its fibular margin the fibula is always slender in its middle apart from the tibia and thickened at its ends there are four bones of the tarsus as in the crocodiles and the bones of the metatarsus like those of the metacarpus and the phalanges of the toes and fingers are lengthened to form prehensile flexible mem bers for climbing in these land forms of saurian rep tiles the skeleton of the nilotic crocodiles fig like that of the gavials and alligators belongs to reptiles destined to swim through the water by the lateral movements of a powerful muscular vertical tail and also by the impulse of long webbed feet their long bones are coarse in texture and filled internally with a loose osseous structure contain ing a thin oily marrow the whole bones of the head are firmly united together by sutures so as to admit of no motion on each other the parietals are anchylosed to gether the tympanic bone is fixed by sutures to the other parts of the temporal and forms a prominent condyle for the lower jaw the median frontals are anchylosed together but the two anterior and the two posterior frontals are detached the large malar bones continued from the lachrymal to the temporals form the outer boundary of the orbits the nasal bones extend between the upper jaw bones to the intermaxillaries in the crocodiles and alligators but in the gavials they extend only to a short distance along the muzzle so that that lengthened part of the face is not weakened by so many sutures the whole of the rounded termination of the upper jaw is formed by the in termaxillaries which surround the nasal aperture the teeth of these crocodilian sauria are hollow striated cones which contain within their cavity the new teeth which are to succeed them and they are firmly lodged in deep alveoli the vertebrae of the crocodilian animals have for the most part a lengthened narrow body concave before and convex behind as in other reptiles the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae are very broad and long and detached like ribs and impede the lateral movements while they encrease the muscular power of the neck for carrying off and struggling with their large prey there are two pairs of false ribs before and two pairs behind the true ribs the true ribs have a strong attachment by fheir lengthened head and prominent tubercle to the sides of the bodies of the vertebras and the extremities of their transverse processes the sternal ribs fig q are ossified and similar ossified ribs are con tinued along the fore part of the abdomen to the pubis the scapula and the coracoid bone are separate more lengthened and narrow than in the lizards and more thick and solid the clavicular bone of the lizards is here extended forward below the neck and the ento and xiphisternal portions are most developed in the sternum the three pelvic bones are more loose than in other saurians the short expanded iliac bones gj are attached to two broad sacral vertebrae the ossa ischii a meet in front and form an expanded symphysis like most pubic bones the pubic bones i are the most slender and extend forward from the cotyloid cavity converg ing but without meeting to form a symphysis the humerus by and the femur are both curved in the direction best calculated to give effect to their movements in the water the radius c and the ulna d as well as the tibia and the fibula m are here strong and separate to their extremities leaving a large interosseous space and forming a broad and highly moveable articulation at the carpus e and the tarsus n the bones of the metacarpus and metatarsus o and the phalanges of the fingers and toes are long and securely articulated at both ends for their double use in the water and on land the chelonian reptiles differ from the sauria in having the ribs immoveable and from the serpents in having arms and legs but their skeleton retains the ordinary conditions of that of the class in the coarse fibrous texture of the bones in the want of continuous cavities in the long bones and in the permanent separation of the cranial and other osseous elements the cervical and the coccygeal vertebrae are those which alone are moveable and nearly throughout the whole column their bodies present the usual concavity at their anterior end and convex termination behind the vertebrae of the trunk have a lengthened form as seen in the caretta caouana fig and their bodies their laminae and their spinous processes are connected only by sutures there are eight pairs of ribs united to each other by sutures and attached between the bodies of the vertebrae by their union with each other and with the expanded spinous pro cesses of the dorsal vertebrae they form the upper shield or carapace the lower shield or plastron is formed by the nine elements of the sternum and these two parts are attached to each other by the sternal appendices which admit of motion in the turtles the scapulae a are generally cylin drical bones more or less lengthened extending from the sides of the first pair of dorsal ver tebrae to the glenoid ca vity for the head of the humerus and they are anchylosed to the cora coid bones which converge and have their free ends attached to the interior of the entosternal bone the two clavicles c are separated by suture from the scapulae and are generally flat and expanded at their free extremities which extend backward and inwards the ver tebrae composing the sacrum are anchylosed to each other and from their sides extend downwards and outwards two short cylindrical iliac bones which enter into the forma tion of the cotyloid cavity like the two other pelvic bones the ossa ischii which meet in front as in other reptiles and the two broad expanded pubic bones i which generally send upwards obliquely a large process like the marsupial bones of mammalia in the sternum of the land tortoise fig the nine elements are firmly united to each other by sutures and also in the same manner to the sternal ribs the two episternal pieces a form the anterior margin and unite behind with the entosternal piece which is single on the median plane and with the two hyosternal pieces e c which extend laterally to unite with the sternal ribs the two hyposternal elements d d are large and broad like the hyoster nal and also like them unite laterally with the sternal ribs the two xiphisternal pieces e e are united to each other and to the hyposternals by serrated sutures and form the whole posterior termination of the plastron or lower shield in the sternum of the tur tles fig nearly all these elements are moveable on each other and at their points of contact with the sternal ribs the two episternals taper laterally to a point and are not united by sutures the entosternal has its whole posterior portion free and although the hyo c c and hypo d d sternals on each side are united together by firm sutures they have moveable articulations on their lateral margins the xiphisternals e e are here freely moveable and taper to a point posteriorly like the two episternals so that there is great solidity in the whole plastron as in the whole carapace of the land animals to resist pressure to which they are much exposed and they form a dense framework for their muscular movements on the land while there is great mobility in the sternal apparatus of the aquatic species for the extensive respiration which they require in that dense element the bones of the head in the chelonia like those of the crocodiles are immoveably united by sutures and in place of teeth there are strong cutting horny plates covering the alveolar surface of the jaws as in birds the occipital condyle is composed of three distinct facets formed by the basilar and the two condyloid portions of that bone the superior median portion of the occipital extends backwards in form of a long spinous process as in most osseous fishes for the attachment of the powerful muscles of the neck the two parietal bones are separate and form in the tortoises of the land an elevated longitudinal ridge which is continued forwards over the cranium to the frontal bone in the marine turtles and in the fresh water emydes as seen in the skull of the emys expansa fig h h the parietal bones rise upwards on the median line of the head and extend laterally over the temporal fossa the tympanic bones are large fixed by suture as in the croco diles and extend downwards to form a condyle for the articular cavity of the lower jaw the two posterior g g and the two middle frontals bound the orbits above and the two malar bones i i behind the two anterior frontals a a bound the orbits in front and expand over the nasal aperture like nasal bones the inter maxillaries are narrow vertical with an extensive palatine surface and like the superior maxillaries they present a sharp alveolar edge which is covered with the cutting horny superior mandible behind the two jugal bones i i are the expanded squamous portions k k of the temporals and behind these the two long descending mastoid bones m m anterior to the mastoid bones m m are the upper portions of the tym panic bones r r two portions o o detached from the condyloid elements q q of the occipitals are termed ex terior occipitals by cuvier the ossicula auditus are an chylosed together as in many of the lower vertebrata the symphysis of the lower jaw is anchylosed at a very early period of growth as in birds from the importance of the os hyoides in the motions of respiration in these animals where the ribs are fixed its body and cornua are very large and strong the arms of the tortoise are fixed in a state of pronation to strengthen them for the support of the heavy trunk and like those of the legs all their bones are short and massive in their proportions the humerus is much bent the radius and ulna short strong and with a very broad articular surface at the carpus and the succeeding bones of the hands are short and almost cubical for support and for digging like those of the mole the same proportions are observed in the bones of the posterior extremities but the outer toe is generally quite rudimentary while the five fingers are more equally developed on the hands in the aquatic chelonia the bones of the extremities have a more lengthened straight and slender form and especially of the anterior extremities fig which are much more developed than the posterior they are also more flat and compressed and less moveable on each other so that they form a near approach to the condition of these bones in the arms of a cetaceous animal or in the arms and legs of an ichthyo saurus and a plesiosaurus the humerus fig d the radius e and the ulna the bones of the carpus ff and even those of the metacarpus and the phalanges of the fingers h partake of this lengthened and flattened form the best adapted for progressive motion through the water and we observe the same character though to a less extent in the femur m the tibia n and the fibula o and in the bones of the tarsus p the metatarsus and the phalanges of the toes q where all the parts are shorter than the corresponding bones of the anterior extremities xxii aves the bones of birds are more compact white dense and brittle than those of any other class they have thinner parietes their internal cavities are pro portionally larger and for the most part they contain air in place of marrow from the great extent of their res piration and the consequent encreased energy of all their functions ossification proceeds in birds to the greatest ex tent not only in the consolidation of the several pieces of the skeleton but in the anchylosis of the separate elements and separate bones with each other throughout the skeleton and in the consolidation by phosphate of lime of cartilagi nous and tendinous parts not ossified in other classes in the young state the bones of birds are filled with a thin serous marrow like those of reptiles and this is displaced by the admission of air during growth to a very variable extent in the different orders of this class the air being admitted most extensively in the high flying rapacious birds and least in the heavy swimming palmipeds there is greater uniformity in the skeleton of this than of the other ver tebrated classes the arms are here adapted solely for flight the legs for support and the head and neck are long and extensively moveable as organs of prehension hence the peculiar forms presented by these regions of the skeleton in birds as seen in the skeleton of the griffon vulture vultur fulvus fig as the body is supported wholly on the legs the toes extend to a great length to afford a broad base the legs are placed forwards upon the sides of the pelvis the trunk is in clined backwards upon these organs of support the neck and head are proportionally elongated to reach the food upon the ground and the arms and hands are folded longitu dinally along the sides of the trunk as in the bats the trunk of birds is almost as fixed as that of a tortoise to give strength to the muscles em ployed in flight and the ver tebrae of the neck and tail are almost alone moveable the rapid ossification and anchylosis here affects not only the bones of the skull but the whole bones of the pelvis the lower jaw the scapular arch the clavicles and the sternum this tendency to ossification affects the sternocostal cartilages the tendons of the muscles of the legs the sclerotic coat of the eye the rings of the trachea and the inferior larynx the vertebrae of the neck are always more numerous than in the mammalia and are sometimes more than three times the number common to that class they have their articu lar surfaces so directed that the neck is naturally concave in front at the upper part and convex in front at the lower part presenting more or less of that sigmoid curviture which is so conspicuous in the longnecked birds the oblique processes as seen in those of the swan fig h hj are generally long narrow and diverging admitting with safety of very extensive motion the spinous pro cesses i i are very short to offer no obstruction to the movements of the neck the transverse processes are short and strong and give passage to a large foramen c c on each side for the vertebral arteries and nerves the foramen for the spinal chord is dilated at its anterior and posterior extremity in the direction of the greatest motion of the vertebrae in order to protect from compres sion the spinal chord and the nerves which enter it laterally the posterior ends of the bodies of the vertebrae are nar row convex arched transversely and received into a corresponding transverse groove on the anterior part of the body of the next succeeding vertebrae the trans verse processes are prolonged so far backwards g y as almost to form a continuous canal along the sides of the neck for the protection of the enclosed large vertebral arteries and the cervi cal portion of the sympathetic nerves the forms of the pro cesses and of the articulations of the dorsal vertebrae are calcu lated by every means but by anchylosis to impede motion and to give solidity to that part of the trunk the spinous processes of these vertebrae are developed forwards and backwards to such an extent that they come almost into contact with each other before and behind the free ends of the transverse processes extend so much forwards and backwards that they commonly pass over each other in an imbricated manner and prevent ah lateral motion and the anterior or sternal surface of the bodies of these verte brae are often compressed carinated and extended down wards like inferior spinous processes which further impede motion the dorsal vertebrae are often anchylosed toge ther like all the lumbar and sacral to give greater solidity to the trunk for the movements of flying the lumbar vertebrae are most free in the ostrich in other birds they are anchylosed to each other and to the sacral as the sacral are to each other and to the iliac bones so that the different kinds of vertebrae in this region of the trunk are almost indistinguishable from each other and the sacral vertebrae are more numerous than in all other forms of ver tebrata the canal for the spinal chord in the middle of the sacrum between the two cotyloid cavities where the nerves of the posterior extremities commence is very wide and corresponds with the great inferior enlargement of the spinal chord at that place in the intervals between the transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae are contained internally on each side the several unequal lobes of the kidneys the coccygeal vertebrae are moveable and strong in birds to support the plumage and muscles of this great and flexible organ of motion they have long transverse processes and spinous processes both above and below the bodies and the last of the vertebrae fig g has a lengthened compressed crescentic form to increase the ex tent of its lateral surfaces the lengthened form of the head in birds depends chiefly on the elongation of the jaws and corresponds with the lengthened form of the neck and the various manipulations and prehensile uses to which this part is applied the cranium is short and broad like that of most
