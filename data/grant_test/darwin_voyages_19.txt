at the expense of their boys associating entirely with convict servants i am not aware that the tone of society has assumed any peculiar character but with such habits and without intellectual pursuits it can hardly fail to deteriorate my opinion is such that nothing but rather severe necessity should compel me to emigrate the rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me not understanding these subjects very puzzling the two main exports are wool and whaleoil and to both of these productions there is a limit the country is totally unfit for canals therefore there is a line not very distant beyond which the land carriage of wool will not repay the expense of shearing and tending sheep pasture every where is so thin that settlers have already pushed far into the interior moreover the country further inland becomes extremely poor i have before said that agriculture can never succeed on a very extended scale therefore so far as i can see australia must ultimately depend upon being the centre of commerce for the southern hemisphere and perhaps on her future manufactories possessing coal she always has the moving power at hand from the habitable country extending along the coast and from her english extraction she is sure to be a maritime nation i formerly imagined that australia would rise to be as grand and powerful a country as north america but now it appears to me such future grandeur is rather problematical with respect to the state of the convicts i had still fewer opportunities of judging than on other points the first question is whether their condition is at all one of punishment no one will maintain that it is a very severe one this however i suppose is of little consequence as long as it continues to be an object of dread to criminals at home the corporeal wants of the convicts are tolerably well supplied their prospect of future liberty and comfort is not distant and after good conduct certain a ticket of leave which as long as a man keeps clear of suspicion as well as of crime makes him free within a certain district is given upon good conduct after years proportional to the length of the sentence for life eight years is the time of probation for seven years four c yet with all this and overlooking the previous imprisonment and wretched passage out i believe the years of assignment are passed away with discontent and unhappiness as an intelligent man remarked to me the convicts know no pleasure beyond sensuality and in this they are not gratified the enormous bribe which government possesses in offering free pardons together with the deep horror of the secluded penal settlements destroys confidence between the convicts and so prevents crime as to a sense of shame such a feeling does not appear to be known and of this i witnessed some very singular proofs though it is a curious fact i was universally told that the character of the convict population is one of arrant cowardice not unfrequently some become desperate and quite indifferent of life yet a plan requiring cool or continued courage is seldom put into execution the worst feature in the whole case is that although there exists what may be called a legal reform and comparatively little which the law can touch is committed yet that any moral reform should take place appears to be quite out of the question i was assured by wellinformed people that a man who should try to improve could not while living with other assigned servants his life would be one of intolerable misery and persecution nor must the contamination of the convict ships and prisons both here and in england be forgotten on the whole as a place of punishment the object is scarcely gained as a real system of reform it has failed as perhaps would every other plan but as a means of making men outwardly honestof converting vagabonds most useless in one hemisphere into active citizens of another and thus giving birth to a new and splendid countrya grand centre of civilizationit has succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in history van diemens land january ththe beagle sailed for hobart town in van diemens land on the th of february after a six days passage of which the first part was fine and the latter very cold and squally we entered the mouth of storm bay the weather justified this awful name the bay should rather be called an estuary for it receives at its head the waters of the derwent near the mouth there are some extensive basaltic platforms but higher up the land becomes mountainous and is covered by a light wood the lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared and the bright yellow fields of corn and dark green ones of potatoes appeared very luxuriant late in the evening we anchored in the snug cove on the shores of which stands the capital of tasmania as van diemens land is now called the first aspect of the place was very inferior to that of sydney the latter might be called a city this only a town in the morning i walked on shore the streets are fine and broad but the houses rather scattered the shops appeared good the town stands at the base of mount wellington a mountain feet high but of very little picturesque beauty from this source however it receives a good supply of water round the cove there are some fine warehouses and on one side a small fort coming from the spanish settlements where such magnificent care has generally been paid to the fortifications the means of defence in these colonies appeared very contemptible comparing the town to sydney i was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of the large houses either built or building this circumstance must indicate that fewer people are gaining large fortunes the growth however of small houses has been most abundant and the vast number of little red brick dwellings scattered on the hill behind the town sadly destroys its picturesque appearance hobart town from the census of this year contained inhabitants and the whole of tasmania all the aborigines have been removed to an island in basss straits so that van diemens land enjoys the great advantage of being free from a native population this most cruel step seems to have been quite unavoidable as the only means of stopping a fearful succession of robberies burnings and murders committed by the blacks but which sooner or later must have ended in their utter destruction i fear there is no doubt that this train of evil and its consequences originated in the infamous conduct of some of our countrymen thirty years is a short period in which to have banished the last aboriginal from his native islandand that island nearly as large as ireland i do not know a more striking instance of the comparative rate of increase of a civilized over a savage people the correspondence to show the necessity of this step which took place between the government at home and that of van diemens land is very interesting it is published in an appendix to bischoffs history of van diemens land although numbers of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the skirmishing which was going on at intervals for several years nothing seems fully to have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming power until the whole island in was put under martial law and by proclamation the whole population desired to assist in one great attempt to secure the entire race the plan adopted was nearly similar to that of the great huntingmatches in india a line reaching across the island was formed with the intention of driving the natives into a culdesac on tasmans peninsula the attempt failed the natives having tied up their dogs stole during one night through the lines this is far from surprising when their practised senses and accustomed manner of crawling after wild animals is considered i have been assured that they can conceal themselves on almost bare ground in a manner which until witnessed is scarcely credible the country is every where scattered over with blackened stumps and the dusky natives are easily mistaken for these objects i have heard of a trial between a party of englishmen and a native who stood in full view on the side of a bare hill if the englishmen closed their eyes for scarcely more than a second he would squat down and then they were never able to distinguish the man from the surrounding stumps but to return to the huntingmatch the natives understanding this kind of warfare were terribly alarmed for they at once perceived the power and numbers of the whites shortly afterwards a party of thirteen belonging to two tribes came in and conscious of their unprotected condition delivered themselves up in despair subsequently by the intrepid exertions of mr robinson an active and benevolent man who fearlessly visited by himself the most hostile of the natives the whole were induced to act in a similar manner they were then removed to gun carriage island where food and clothes were provided them i fear from what i heard at hobart town that they are very far from being contented some even think the race will soon become extinct the beagle staid here ten days and in this time i made several pleasant little excursions chiefly with the object of examining the geological structure of the immediate neighbourhood the main points of interest consist first in the presence of certain basaltic rocks which evidently have flowed as lava secondly in some great unstratified masses of greenstone thirdly in proofs of an exceedingly small rise of the land fourthly in some ancient fossiliferous strata probably of the age of the silurian system of europe and lastly in a a solitary and superficial patch of yellowish limestone or travertin which contains numerous impressions of leaves of trees and plants not now existing it is not improbable that this one small quarry includes the only remaining record of the vegetation of van diemens land during one former epoch mr frankland the surveyorgeneral was kind enough to give me much interesting information and to take me several pleasant rides the climate here is damper than in new south wales and hence the land is more fertile agriculture flourishes here the cultivated fields looked well and the gardens abounded with thriving vegetables and fruittrees some of the farmhouses situated in retired spots had a very tempting appearance the general aspect of the vegetation is similar to that of australia perhaps it is a little more green and cheerful and the pasture between the trees rather more abundant one day i took a long walk on the side of the bay opposite to the town i crossed in a steamboat two of which are constantly plying backwards and forwards the machinery of one of these vessels was entirely manufactured in this colony which from its very foundation then numbered only threeandthirty years if i was obliged to emigrate i think i would choose this place in preference to sydney the climate and aspect of the country alone would almost determine me moreover i suspect society is here on a pleasanter footing certainly it is free from the contamination of rich convicts and the dissensions consequent on the existence of two classes of wealthy residents the colony appeared extremely well governed the streets at night being kept even more orderly than those of an english town on another day i ascended mount wellington i took with me a guide for i failed in a first attempt from the thickness of the wood my guide however was a stupid fellow and conducted us to the southern and damp side of the mountain where the vegetation was very luxuriant and the labour of the ascent from the number of rotten trunks almost as great as on a mountain in tierra del fuego or in chiloe it cost us five and a half hours of hard climbing before we reached the summit in many parts the gumtrees grew to a great size and the whole composed a noble forest in some of the dampest ravines treeferns flourished in an extraordinary manner i saw one which must have been at least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds and was in girth exactly six feet the foliage of these trees forming so many most elegant parasols created a gloomy shade like that of the first hour of night the summit of the mountain is broad and flat and is composed of huge angular masses of naked greenstone its elevation is feet above the level of the sea the day was splendidly clear and we enjoyed a most extensive view to the northward the country appeared a mass of wooded mountains of about the same elevation and tame outline with the one on which we were standing to the south the outline of the broken land and water forming many intricate bays was mapped with clearness before us after staying some hours on the summit we found a better way to descend but did not reach the beagle till eight oclock after a severe days work february ththe beagle sailed from tasmania and on the th of the ensuing month reached king georges sound situated near the sw corner of australia we staid there eight days and i do not remember since leaving england having passed a more dull uninteresting time the country viewed from an eminence appears a woody plain with here and there rounded and partly bare hills of granite protruding one day i went out with a party in hopes of seeing a kangaroo hunt and walked over a good many miles of country every where we found the soil sandy and very poor it either supported a coarse vegetation of thin low brushwood and wiry grass or a forest of stunted trees the scenery resembled the elevated sandstone platform of the blue mountains the casuarina a tree somewhat resembling a scotch fir is however here in greater number as the eucalyptus is in rather less in the open parts there were many grasstreesa plant which in appearance has some affinity with the palm but instead of being surmounted by a crown of noble fronds it can boast merely of a tuft of coarse grass the general bright green colour of the brushwood and other plants viewed from a distance seemed to bespeak fertility a single walk however will quite dispel such an illusion and he who thinks with me will never wish to walk again in so uninviting a country one day i accompanied captain fitzroy to bald head the place mentioned by so many navigators where some imagined they saw coral and others petrified trees standing in the position in which they grew according to our view the rock was formed by the wind heaping up calcareous sand during which process branches and roots of trees and landshells were enclosed the mass being afterward consolidated by the percolation of rainwater when the wood had decayed lime was washed into the cylindrical cavities and became hard sometimes even like that in a stalactite the weather is now wearing away the softer rock and in consequence the casts of roots and branches project above the surface their resemblance to the stumps of a dead shrubbery was so exact that before touching them we were sometimes at a loss to know which were composed of wood and which of calcareous matter a large tribe of natives called the white cockatoo men happened to pay the town a visit while we were there these men as well as those of the tribe belonging to king georges sound being tempted by the offer of some tubs of rice and sugar were persuaded to hold a corrobery or great dancingparty as soon as it grew dark small fires were lighted and the men commenced their toilet which consisted in painting themselves white in spots and lines as soon as all was ready large fires were kept blazing round which the women and children were collected as spectators the cockatoo and king georges men formed two distinct parties and danced generally in answer to each other the dancing consisted in the whole set running either sideways or in indian file into an open space and stamping the ground with great force as they marched together their heavy footsteps were accompanied by a kind of grunt and by beating their clubs and weapons and various other gesticulations such as extending their arms and wriggling their bodies it was a most rude barbarous scene and to our ideas without any sort of meaning but we observed that the women and children watched the whole proceeding with the greatest pleasure perhaps these dances originally represented some scenes such as wars and victories there was one called the emu dance in which each man extended his arm in a bent manner so as to imitate the neck of that bird in another dance one man took off the movements of a kangaroo grazing in the woods whilst a second crawled up and pretended to spear him when both tribes mingled in the dance the ground trembled with the heaviness of their steps and the air resounded with their wild cries every one appeared in high spirits and the group of nearly naked figures viewed by the light of the blazing fires all moving in hideous harmony formed a perfect representation of a festival amongst the lowest barbarians in tierra del fuego we have beheld many curious scenes in savage life but never i think one where the natives were in such high spirits and so perfectly at their ease after the dancing was over the whole party formed a great circle on the ground and the boiled rice and sugar was distributed to the delight of all after several tedious delays from clouded weather on the th of march we gladly stood out of king georges sound on our course to keeling island farewell australia you are a rising infant and doubtless some day will reign a great princess in the south but you are too great and ambitious for affection yet not great enough for respect i leave your shores without sorrow or regret chapter xxii keeling island singular appearance scanty flora transport of seeds birds and insects ebbing and flowing springs coral formations resisting power of ocean fields of dead coral stones transported by roots of trees great crab stinging corals structure of lagoon islands encircling and barrier reefs general proofs of subsidence in the pacific theory of lagoon islands caused by subsidence of the land pacific and indian oceans divided into alternate areas of elevation and subsidence points of eruption lie within the areas of elevation coral formations april stwe arrived in view of the keeling or cocos islands situated in the indian ocean and about six hundred miles distant from the coast of sumatra this is one of the lagoon islands of coral formation similar to those we passed in the dangerous archipelago an excellent idea of the general appearance of these extraordinary rings of land which rise out of the depths of the ocean may be obtained from the characteristic sketch of whitsunday island in beecheys voyage when the ship was in the channel at the entrance mr liesk an english resident came off in his boat the history of the inhabitants of this place in as few words as possible is as follows about nine years ago a mr hare a very worthless character brought from the east indian archipelago a number of malay slaves which now including children amount to more than a hundred shortly afterwards captain ross who had before visited these islands in his merchantship arrived from england bringing with him his family and goods for settlement along with him came mr liesk who had been a mate in his vessel the malay slaves soon ran away from the island on which mr hare was settled and joined captain rosss party mr hare upon this was ultimately obliged to leave these islands the malays are now nominally in a state of freedom and certainly are so as far as regards their personal treatment but in most other points they are considered as slaves from the discontented state of the people the repeated removals and perhaps also from a little mismanagement things are not very prosperous the island has no quadruped excepting the pig and no vegetable in any quantity excepting the cocoanut on the latter the whole prosperity of the place depends the only exports are oil from the nut and the cocoanut itself on it the pigs which are loaded with fat almost entirely subsist as likewise do the poultry and ducks even a huge landcrab is furnished by nature with a curious instinct and form of legs to open and feed on this same fruit the annular reef of this lagoon island is surmounted in the greater part of its length by linear islets on the northern or leeward side there is an opening through which vessels reach the anchorage on entering the scene was very curious and rather pretty its beauty however being solely dependant on the brilliancy of the surrounding colours the shallow clear and still water of the lagoon resting in its greater part on white sand is when illuminated by a vertical sun of a most vivid green this brilliant expanse several miles in width is on all sides divided either from the dark heaving water of the ocean by a line of snowwhite breakers or from the blue vault of heaven by the strips of land crowned at an equal height by the tops of the cocoanut trees as a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing contrast with the azure sky so in the lagoon dark bands of living coral appear through the emerald green water the next morning after anchoring i went on shore on direction island the strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards wide on the lagoon side we have a white calcareous beach the radiation from which in such a climate is very oppressive and on the outer coast a solid broad flat of coral rock which serves to break the violence of the open sea excepting near the lagoon where there is some sand the land is entirely composed of rounded fragments of coral in such a loose dry stony soil the climate of the intertropical regions alone could produce a vigorous vegetation on some of the smaller islets nothing could be more elegant than the manner in which the young and fullgrown cocoanut trees without destroying each others symmetry were mingled into one wood a beach of glittering white sand formed a border to these fairy spots i will now give a sketch of the natural history of these islands which from its very paucity possesses a peculiar interest the cocoanut tree at the first glance seems to compose the whole wood there are however five or six other kinds one of these grows to a very large size but from the extreme softness of its wood is useless another sort affords excellent timber for shipbuilding besides the trees the number of plants is exceedingly limited and consists of insignificant weeds in my collection which includes i believe nearly the perfect flora there are twenty species without reckoning a moss lichen and fungus to this number two trees must be added one of which was not in flower and the other i only heard of the latter is a solitary tree of its kind in the whole group and grows near the beach where without doubt the one seed was thrown up by the waves i do not include in the above list the sugarcane banana some other vegetables fruittrees and imported grasses as these islands consist entirely of coral and at one time probably existed as a mere waterwashed reef all the productions now living here must have been transported by the waves of the sea in accordance to this the flora has quite the character of a refuge for the destitute professor henslow informs me that of the twenty species nineteen belong to different genera and these again to no less than sixteen orders in holmans travels an account is given on the authority of mr a s keating who resided twelve months on these islands of the various seeds and other bodies which have been known to have been washed on shore seeds and plants from sumatra and java have been driven up by the surf on the windward side of the islands among them have been found the kimiri native of sumatra and the peninsula of malacca the cocoanut of balci known by its shape and size the dadass which is planted by the malays with the peppervine the latter intwining round its trunk and supporting itself by the prickles on its stem the soaptree the castoroil plant trunks of the sago palm and various kinds of seeds unknown to the malays who settled on the islands these are all supposed to have been driven on shore by the nw monsoon to the coast of new holland and thence to these islands by the se tradewind large masses of java teak and yellow wood have also been found besides immense trees of red and white cedar and the blue gumwood of new holland in a perfectly sound condition all the hardy seeds such as creepers retain their germinating power but the softer kinds among which is the mangostin are destroyed in the passage fishingcanoes apparently from java have at times been washed on shore it is interesting thus to discover how numerous the seeds are which coming from several countries are drifted over the wide ocean professor henslow tells me he believes that nearly all the plants which i brought from this island are common littoral species in the east indian archipelago from the direction however of the winds and currents it seems scarcely possible that they can have come here in a direct line if as suggested with much probability by mr keating they have first been carried towards the coast of new holland and thence drifted back again together with the productions of that country the seeds before germinating must have travelled between and miles chamisso when describing the radack archipelago situated in the central part of the western pacific states that the sea brings to these islands the seeds and fruits of many trees most of which have yet not grown here the greater part of these seeds appear to have not yet lost the capability of growing it is also said that trunks of northern firs are washed on shore which must have been floated from an immense distance these facts are highly interesting it cannot be doubted if there were landbirds to pick up the seeds when first cast on shore and a soil more adapted for their growth than the loose blocks of coral that such islands although so isolated would soon possess a more abundant flora the list of landanimals is even poorer than that of plants some of the islets are inhabited by rats and their origin is known to be due to a ship from the mauritius which was wrecked here these rats have rather a different appearance from the english kind they are smaller and much more brightly coloured there are no true landbirds for a snipe and a rail rallus phillippensis though living entirely among the dry herbage belong to the order of waders birds of this order are said to occur on several of the low islands in the pacific at ascension a rail porphyrio was shot near the summit of the mountain and it was evidently a solitary straggler from these circumstances i believe the waders are the first colonists of any island after the innumerable webfooted species i may add that whenever i have noticed birds which were not pelagic very far out at sea they always belonged to this order and hence they would naturally become the earliest colonist of any distant point of reptiles i saw only one small lizard of insects i took pains to collect every kind exclusive of spiders which were numerous there were thirteen species of these one only was a beetle a small species of ant swarmed by thousands under the loose dry blocks of coral and was the only true insect which was abundant although the productions of the land are thus scanty if we look to the waters of the surrounding sea the number of organic beings is indeed infinite chamisso has described the natural history of romanzoff a lagoon island in the radack archipelago the number and kind of productions there is very nearly the same with those here one small lizard was seen wading birds numenius and scolopax were numerous and very tame of plants he states there were nineteen species including one fern and some of them are the same species with those i collected here although on an island situated in a different ocean these strips of land are raised only to that height to which the surf can throw fragments and the wind heap up sand their protection is due to the outward and lateral increase of the reef which thus breaks the sea the aspect and constitution of these islets at once call up the idea that the land and the ocean are here struggling for mastery although terrafirma has obtained a footing the denizens of the other element think their claim at least equal in every part one meets hermitcrabs of more than one species carrying on their backs the houses they have stolen from the neighbouring beach overhead the trees are occupied by numbers of gannets frigatebirds and terns from the many nests and smell of the atmosphere this might be called a searookery the gannets sitting on their rude nests look at an intruder with a stupid yet angry air the noddies as their name expresses are silly little creatures but there is one charming bird it is a small and snowwhite tern which smoothly hovers at the distance of an arms length from your head its large black eye scanning with quiet curiosity your expression little imagination is required to fancy that so light and delicate a body must be tenanted by some wandering fairy spirit sunday april dafter service i accompanied captain fitzroy to the settlement situated at the distance of some miles on a point thickly scattered over with tall cocoanut trees captain ross and mr liesk live in a large barnlike house open at both ends and lined with mats made of woven bark the houses of the malays are arranged along the shore of the lagoon the whole place had rather a desolate aspect because there were no gardens to show the signs of care and cultivation the natives belong to different islands in the east indian archipelago but all speak the same language we saw inhabitants of borneo celebes java and sumatra in the colour of their skin they resemble the tahitians nor do they widely differ from them in form of features some of the women however showed a good deal of the chinese character i liked both their general expression and the sound of their voices they appeared poor and their houses were destitute of furniture but it was evident from the plumpness of the little children that cocoanuts and turtle afford no bad sustenance on this island the wells are situated from which ships obtain water at first sight it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water should regularly ebb and flow with the usual tide we must believe that the compressed sand or porous coral rock acts like a sponge and that the rain water which falls on the ground being specifically lighter than the salt merely floats on its surface and is subject to the same movements there can be no actual attraction between salt and fresh water and the spongy texture must tend to prevent all admixture from slight disturbances on the other hand where the foundation consists only of loose fragments upon a well being dug salt or brackish water enters of which fact we saw an instance on this same island after dinner we stayed to see a half superstitious scene acted by the malay women they dress a large wooden spoon in garments carry it to the grave of a dead man and then at the full of the moon they pretend it becomes inspired and will dance and jump about after the proper preparations the spoon held by two women became convulsed and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding children and women it was a most foolish spectacle but mr liesk maintained that many of the malays believed in its spiritual movement the dance did not commence till the moon had risen and it was well worth remaining to behold her bright globe so quietly shining through the long arms of the cocoanuts as they waved in the evening breeze these scenes of the tropics are in themselves so delicious that they almost equal those dearer ones to which we are bound by each best feeling of the mind the next day i employed myself in examining the very interesting yet simple structure and origin of these islands the water being unusually smooth i waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks in some of the gullies and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured fishes and the forms and tints of many of the zoophytes were admirable it is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics so prodigal of life teems yet i must confess i think those naturalists who have described in wellknown words the submarine grottoes decked with a thousand beauties have indulged in rather exuberant language april thi accompanied captain fitzroy to an island at the head of the lagoon the channel was exceedingly intricate winding through fields of delicately branched corals we saw several turtle and two boats were then employed in catching them the method is rather curious the water is so clear and shallow that although at first a turtle quickly dives out of sight yet in a canoe or boat under sail the pursuers after no very long chase come up to it a man standing ready in the bows at this moment dashes through the water upon the turtles back then clinging with both hands by the shell of its neck he is carried away till the animal becomes exhausted and is secured it was quite an interesting chase to see the two boats thus doubling about and the men dashing into the water trying to seize their prey when we arrived at the head of the lagoon we crossed the narrow islet and found a great surf breaking on the windward coast i can hardly explain the cause but there is to my mind a considerable degree of grandeur in the view of the outer shores of these lagoon islands there is a simplicity in the barrierlike beach the margin of green bushes and tall cocoanuts the solid flat of coral rock strewed here and there with great fragments and the line of furious breakers all rounding away towards either hand the ocean throwing its waters over the broad reef appears an invincible allpowerful enemy yet we see it resisted and even conquered by means which at first seem most weak and inefficient it is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral the great fragments scattered over the reef and accumulated on the beach whence the tall cocoanut springs plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of its waves nor are there any periods of repose granted the long swell caused by the gentle but steady action of the tradewind always blowing in one direction over a wide area causes breakers which even exceed in violence those of our temperate regions and which never cease to rage it is impossible to behold these waves without feeling a conviction that an island though built of the hardest rock let it be porphyry granite or quartz would ultimately yield and be demolished by such irresistible forces yet these low insignificant coral islets stand and are victorious for here another power as antagonist to the former takes part in the contest the organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of lime one by one from the foaming breakers and unite them into a symmetrical structure let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge fragments yet what will this tell against the accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day month after month thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a polypus through the agency of the vital laws conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the art of man nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist we did not return on board till late in the evening as we staid some time in the lagoon collecting specimens of the giant chama and looking at the coral fields near the head of the lagoon i was much surprised to find a wide area considerably more than a mile square covered with a forest of branching coral which though standing upright was all dead and rotten at first i was quite at a loss to understand the cause afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following rather curious combination of circumstances it should however first be stated that corals are never able to survive even a short exposure in the air to the suns rays so that their upward limit of growth is determined by that of lowest water at spring tides it appears from some old charts that the long island to windward was formerly separated by wide channels into several islets this fact is likewise indicated by the less age of the trees in certain portions under this former condition of the reef a strong breeze by throwing more water over the barrier would tend to raise the level of the lagoon now it acts in a directly contrary manner for the water not only is not increased by currents from the outside but is blown outwards by the force of the wind hence it is observed that the tides near the head of the lagoon do not rise so high during strong breezes as on ordinary occasions this difference of level although no doubt very small has i believe caused the death of those coral groves which under the former condition of things had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth a few miles north of keeling there is another small lagoon island the centre of which is nearly filled up captain ross found in the conglomerate of the outer coast a well rounded fragment of greenstone rather larger than a mans head he and the men with him were so much surprised at this that they brought it away and preserved it as a curiosity the occurrence of this one stone where every other particle of matter is calcareous certainly is very puzzling the island has scarcely ever been visited nor is it probable that a ship had been wrecked there from the absence of any better explanation i came to the conclusion that it must have come there entangled in the roots of some large tree when however i considered the great distance from the nearest land the combination of chances against a stone thus being entangled the tree washed into the sea floated so far then landed safely and the stone finally so embedded as to allow of its discovery i was almost ashamed of imagining a means of transport so improbable it was therefore with great interest that i found chamisso the justly distinguished naturalist who accompanied kotzebue stating that the inhabitants of the radack archipelago a group of lagoon islands in the midst of the pacific obtained stones for sharpening their instruments by searching the roots of trees which are cast up on the beach it will be evident that this must have happened several times since laws have been established that such stones belong to the chief and a punishment is inflicted on any one who attempts to defraud him of this right when the isolated position of these small islands in the midst of a vast oceantheir great distance from any land excepting that of coral formation a fact well attested by the value which the inhabitants who are such bold navigators attach to a stone of any kindand the slowness of the currents of the open sea are all considered the occurrence of pebbles thus transported does appear wonderful stones may often be thus transported and if the island on which they are stranded is constructed of any other substance besides coral they would scarcely attract attention and their origin at least would never have been guessed moreover this agency may long escape discovery from the probability of trees especially those loaded with stones floating beneath the surface in the channels of tierra del fuego large quantities of drift timber are cast upon the beach yet it is extremely rare to meet a tree swimming on the water it is easy to conceive that waterlogged wood might be transported when floating close to the bottom and occasionally even just touching it the knowledge of any result which with sufficient time allowed can be produced by causes though appearing infinitely improbable is valuable to the geologist for he by his creed deals with centuries and thousands of years as others do with minutes if a few isolated stones are discovered in a mass of fine sedimentary strata it cannot after the above facts be considered as very improbable that they may have been drifted there by the floating timber of a former epoch during another day i visited horsburg and west island in the latter the vegetation was perhaps more luxuriant than in any other part the cocoanut trees generally grow separate but here the young ones flourished beneath their tall parents and formed with their long and curved fronds the most shady arbours those alone who have tried it know how delicious it is to be seated in such shade and drink the cool pleasant fluid of the cocoanut which hangs in great bunches close by in this island there is a large bay or little lagoon composed of the finest white sand it is quite level and is only covered by the tide at high water from this large bay smaller creeks penetrated the surrounding woods to see a field of glittering sand representing water and around the border of which the cocoanut trees extended their tall and waving trunks formed a singular and very pretty view i will now briefly mention a few zoological observations which i made during our stay at these islands i have before alluded to a crab which lives on the cocoanuts it is very common on all parts of the dry land and grows to a monstrous size it is closely allied or identical with birgos latro this crab has its front pair of legs terminated by very strong and heavy pincers and the last pair by others which are narrow and weak it would at first be thought quite impossible for a crab to open a strong cocoanut covered with the husk but mr liesk assures me he has repeatedly seen the operation effected the crab begins by tearing the husk fibre by fibre and always from that end under which the three eye holes are situated when this is completed the crab commences hammering with its heavy claws on one of these eye holes till an opening is made then turning round its body by the aid of its posterior and narrow pair of pincers it extracts the white albuminous substance i think this is as curious a case of instinct as ever i heard of and likewise of adaptation in structure between two objects apparently so remote from each other in the scheme of nature as a crab and a cocoanut tree the birgos is diurnal in its habits but every night it is said to pay a visit to the sea no doubt for the purpose of moistening its branchiæ the young are likewise hatched and live for some time on the coast these crabs inhabit deep burrows which they excavate beneath the roots of trees and here they accumulate surprising quantities of the picked fibres of the cocoanut husk on which they rest as on a bed the malays sometimes take advantage of their labour by collecting the course fibrous substance and using it as junk these crabs are very good to eat moreover under the tail of the larger ones there is a great mass of fat which when melted sometimes yields as much as a quart bottle full of limpid oil it has been stated by some authors that the birgos latro crawls up the cocoanut trees for the purpose of stealing the nuts i very much doubt the possibility of this but with the pandanus the task would be very much easier i understood from mr liesk that on these islands the birgos lives only on the nuts which fall to the ground i was a good deal surprised by finding two species of coral of the genus millepora possessed of the property of stinging the stony branches or plates when taken fresh from the water have a harsh feel and are not slimy although possessing a strong and disagreeable odour the stinging property seems to vary within certain limits in different specimens when a piece was pressed or rubbed on the tender skin of the face or arm a pricking sensation was generally caused which came on after the interval of a second and lasted only for a short time one day however by merely touching my face with one of the branches the pain was instantaneous it increased as usual after a few seconds and remaining sharp for some minutes was perceptible for half an hour afterwards the sensation was as bad as that from a nettle but more like that caused by the portuguese manofwar physalia little red spots were produced on the tender skin of the arm which appeared as if they would have formed watery pustules but did not the circumstance of this stinging property is not new though it has scarcely been sufficiently remarked on m quoy mentions it and i have heard of stinging corals in the west indies in the east indian sea a stinging seaweed also is found there was another and quite distinct kind of coral which was remarkable from the change of colour which it underwent shortly after death when alive it was of a honeyyellow but some hours after being taken out of water it became as black as ink i may just mention as partly connected with the above subjects that there are here two species of fish of the genus sparus which exclusively feed on coral both are coloured of a splendid bluishgreen one living invariably in the lagoon and the other amongst the outer breakers mr liesk assured us that he had repeatedly seen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the tops of the coral branches i opened the intestines of several and found them distended with a yellowish calcareous matter these fish together with the lithophagous shells and nereidous animals which perforate every block of dead coral must be very efficient agents in producing the finest kind of mud and this when derived from such materials appears to be the same with chalk april thin the morning we stood out of the lagoon i am glad we have visited these islands such formations surely rank high amongst the wonderful objects of this world it is not a wonder which at first strikes the eye of the body but rather after reflection the eye of reason we feel surprised when travellers relate accounts of the vast extent of certain ancient ruins but how utterly insignificant are the greatest of these when compared to the pile of stone here accumulated by the work of various minute animals throughout the whole group of islands every single atom even from the smallest particle to large fragments of rock bears the stamp of having been subjected to the power of organic arrangement captain fitzroy at the distance of but little more than a mile from the shore sounded with a line feet long and found no bottom this island is therefore a lofty submarine mountain which has a greater inclination than even those of volcanic origin on the land i will now give a sketch of the general results at which i have arrived respecting the origin of the various classes of reefs which occur scattered over such large spaces of the intertropical seas the first consideration to attend to is that every observation leads to the conclusion that those lamelliform corals which are the efficient agents in forming a reef cannot live at any considerable depth as far as i have personally seen i judge of this from carefully examining the impressions on the soundings which were taken by captain fitzroy at keeling island close outside the breakers and from some others which i obtained at the mauritius at a depth under ten fathoms the arming came up as clean as if it had been dropped on a carpet of thick turf but as the depth increased the particles of sand brought up became more and more numerous until at last it was evident the bottom consisted of a smooth layer of calcareous sand interrupted only at intervals by shelves composed probably of dead coral rock to carry on the analogy the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner till at last the soil was so sterile that nothing sprung from it as long as no facts beyond those relating to the structure of lagoon islands were known so as to establish some more comprehensive theory the belief that corals constructed their habitations or speaking more correctly their skeletons on the circular crests of submarine craters was from malacca and java and the small fragments of pumice drifted here together with the seeds of east indian plants the one block of greenstone moreover on the northern lagoon must be excepted the very general surprise of all those who have beheld lagoon islands has perhaps been one chief cause why other reefs of an equally curious structure have been almost overlooked i allude to the encircling reefs we will take as an instance vanikoro celebrated on account of the shipwreck of la peyrouse the reef there runs at the distance of nearly two and in some parts three miles from the shore and is separated from it by a channel having a general depth between thirty and forty fathoms and in one part no less than fifty or three hundred feet externally the reef rises from an ocean profoundly deep can any thing be more singular than this structure it is analogous to that of a lagoon but with an island standing like a picture in its frame in the middle a fringe of low alluvial land in these cases generally surrounds the base of the mountains this covered by the most beautiful productions of a tropical land backed by the abrupt mountains and fronted by a lake of smooth water only separated from the dark waves of the ocean by a line of breakers form the elements of the beautiful scenery of tahitiso well called the queen of islands we cannot suppose these encircling reefs are based on an external crater for the central mass sometimes consists of primary rock or on any accumulation of sedimentary deposits for the reefs follow indifferently the island itself or its submarine prolongation of this latter case there is a grand instance in new caledonia where the reefs extend no less than miles beyond the island the great barrier which fronts the ne coast of australia forms a third class of reef it is described by flinders as having a length of nearly one thousand miles and as running parallel to the shore at a distance of between twenty and thrty miles from it and in some parts even of fifty and seventy the great arm of the sea thus included has a usual depth of between ten and twenty fathoms but this increases towards one end to forty and even sixty this probably is both the grandest and most extraordinary reef now existing in any part of the world it must be observed that the reef itself in the three classes namely lagoon encircling and barrier agrees in structure even in the most minute details but these i have not space here even to allude to the difference entirely lies in the absence or presence of neighbouring land and the relative position which the reefs bear to it in the two lastmentioned classes there is one difficulty in undertaking their origin which must be pointed out since the time of dampier it has been remarked that high land and deep seas go together now when we see a number of mountainous islands coming abruptly down to the seashore we must suppose the strata of which they are composed are continued with nearly the same inclination beneath the water but in such cases where the reef is distant several miles from the coast it will be evident upon a little consideration that a line drawn perpendicularly from its outer edge down to the solid rock on which the reef must be based very far exceeds that small limit at which the efficient lamelliform corals exist in some parts of the sea as we shall hereafter mention reefs do occur which fringe rather than encircle islandsthe distance from the shore being so small where the inclination of the land is great that there is no difficulty in understandthe growth of the coral even in these fringing reefs as i shall call them in contradistinction to the encircling the reef is not attached quite close to the shore this appears to be the result of two causes namely first that the water immediately adjoining the beach is rendered turbid by the surf and therefore injurious to all zoophytes and secondly that the larger and efficient kinds only flourish on the outer edge amidst the breakers of the open sea the shallow space between the skirting reef and the shore has however a very different character from the deep channel similarly situated with respect to those of the encircling order having thus specified the several kinds of reefs which differ in their forms and relative position with regard to the neighbouring land but which are most closely similar in all other respects as i could show if i had space it will i think be allowed that no explanation can be satisfactory which does not include the whole series the theory which i would offer is simply that as the land with the attached reefs subsides very gradually from the action of subterranean causes the coralbuilding polypi soon raise again their solid masses to the level of the water but not so with the land each inch lost is irreclaimably goneas the whole gradually sinks the water gains foot by foot on the shore till the last and highest peak is finally submerged before i explain this view more in detail i must enter on a few considerations which render such changes of level not improbable indeed the simple fact of a large portion of the continent of south america still rising under our eyes and abounding with proofs of similar elevations on a grander scale during the recent period takes away any excessive improbability of a movement similar in kind but in an opposite direction mr lyell who first suggested the idea of a general subsidence with reference to coral reefs has remarked that the existence of so small a portion of land in the pacific where so many causes both aqueous and igneous tend to its production renders such sinking of the foundation probable there is however another argument of much greater weight which may be inferred from the inconsiderable depth at which corals grow we see large extents of ocean of more than a thousand miles in one direction and several hundreds in another scattered over with islands none of which rise to a greater height than that to which waves can throw fragments or the wind heap up sand now if we leave out of the question subsidence the foundation on which these reefs are built must in every case come to the surface within that small limit we may say twenty fathoms at which corals can live this conclusion is so extremely improbable that it may at once be rejected for in what country can there be found a broad and grand range of mountains of the same height within a hundred and twenty feet but on the idea of subsidence the case is at once clear as each point one after the other according to its altitude was submerged the coral grew upwards and formed the many islets now standing at one level having endeavoured on general grounds not only to remove any extreme degree of improbability in the belief of a general subsidence but likewise to show that it is almost necessary to account for the existence of a vast number of reefs on one level we will now see how far the same idea will apply to the peculiar configuration in the several classes let us imagine an island merely fringed by reefs extending to a short distance from the shore in which case as we have before remarked there is no difficulty in understanding their structure now let this island subside by a series of movements of extreme slowness the coral at each interval growing up to the surface without the aid of sections it is not very easy to follow out the result but a little reflection will show that a reef encircling the shore at a greater or less distance according to the amount of subsidence would be produced if we suppose the sinking to continue the encircled island must by the submergence of the central land but upward growth of the ring of coral be converted into a lagoon island if we take a section of some encircled island on a true scale as for instance gambier which has been so well described by captain beechey we shall not find the amount of movement very great which would be necessary to change a wellcharacterized encircling reef into as characteristic a lagoon island it will at once be evident that a coral reef closely skirting the shore of a continent would in like manner after each subsidence rise to the surface the water however always encroaching on the land would not a barrier reef necessarily be produced similar to the one extending parallel to the coast of australia it is indeed but uncoiling one of those reefs which encircle at a distance so many islands thus the three great classes of reef lagoon encircling and barrier are connected by one theory it will perhaps be remarked if
