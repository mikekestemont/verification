metamorphosed as in most parts of central chile it is composed of beds of true purple claystone porphyry repeatedly alternating with thick beds of purplishred conglomerate with the wellrounded large pebbles of various porphyries not blended together third axis of elevationnear the ravine of los hornitos there is a wellmarked line of elevation extending for many miles in a nne and ssw direction with the strata dipping in most parts as in the second axis only in one direction namely eastward at an average angle of between and close to the mouth of the valley however there is as represented in the section a steep and high mountain d composed of various green and brown intrusive porphyries enveloped with strata apparently belonging to the upper parts of the porphyritic conglomerate and dipping both eastward and westward i will describe the section seen on the eastern side of this mountain d beginning at the base with the lowest bed visible in the porphyritic conglomerate and proceeding upwards through the gypseous formation bed consists of reddish and brownish porphyry varying in character and in many parts highly amygdaloidal with carbonate of lime and with bright green and brown bole its upper surface is throughout clearly defined but the lower surface is in most parts indistinct and towards the summit of the mountain d quite blended into the intrusive porphyries bed a pale lilac hard but not heavy stone slightly laminated including small extraneous fragments and imperfect as well as some perfect and glassy crystals of feldspar from to feet in thickness when examining it in situ i thought it was certainly a true porphyry but my specimens now lead me to suspect that it possibly may be a metamorphosed tuff from its colour it could be traced for a long distance overlying in one part quite conformably to the porphyry of bed and in another not distant part a very thick mass of conglomerate composed of pebbles of a porphyry chiefly like that of bed this fact shows how the nature of the bottom formerly varied in short horizontal distances bed white much indurated tuff containing minute pebbles broken crystals and scales of mica varies much in thickness this bed is remarkable from containing many globular and pearshaped externally rusty balls from the size of an apple to a mans head of very tough slatecoloured porphyry with imperfect crystals of feldspar in shape these balls do not resemble pebbles and i believe that they are subaqueous volcanic bombs they differ from subaërial bombs only in not being vesicular bed a dull purplishred hard conglomerate with crystallised particles and veins of carbonate of lime from to feet in thickness the pebbles are of claystone porphyries of many varieties they are tolerably well rounded and vary in size from a large apple to a mans head this bed includes three layers of coarse black calcareous somewhat slaty rock the upper part passes into a compact red sandstone in a formation so highly variable in mineralogical nature any division not founded on fossil remains must be extremely arbitrary nevertheless the beds below the last conglomerate may in accordance with all the sections hitherto described be considered as belonging to the porphyritic conglomerate and those above it to the gypseous formation marked e in the section the part of the valley in which the following beds are seen is near potrero seco bed compact finegrained pale greenishgray noncalcareous indurated mudstone easily fusible into a pale green and white glass bed purplish coarsegrained hard sandstone with broken crystals of feldspar and crystallised particles of carbonate of lime it possesses a slightly nodular structure bed blackishgray much indurated calcareous mudstone with extraneous particles of unequal size the whole being in parts finely brecciated in this mass there is a stratum twenty feet in thickness of impure gypsum bed a greenish mudstone with several layers of gypsum bed a highly indurated easily fusible white tuff thickly mottled with ferruginous matter and including some white semiporcellanic layers which are interlaced with ferruginous veins this stone closely resembles some of the commonest varieties in the uspallata chain bed a thick bed of rather bright green indurated mudstone or tuff with a concretionary nodular structure so strongly developed that the whole mass consists of balls i will not attempt to estimate the thickness of the strata in the gypseous formation hitherto described but it must certainly be very many hundred feet bed is at least feet in thickness it consists of thin layers of whitish greenish or more commonly brown finegrained indurated tuffs which crumble into angular fragments some of the layers are semiporcellanic many of them highly ferruginous and some are almost composed of carbonate of lime and iron with drusy cavities lined with quartzcrystals bed dull purplish or greenish or darkgray very compact and much indurated mudstone estimated at feet in thickness in some parts this rock assumes the character of an imperfect coarse clayslate but viewed under a lens the basis always has a mottled appearance with the edges of the minute component particles blending together parts are calcareous and there are numerous veins of highly crystalline carbonate of lime charged with iron the mass has a nodular structure and is divided by only a few planes of stratification there are however two layers each about eighteen inches thick of a dark brown finergrained stone having a conchoidal semiporcellanic fracture which can be followed with the eye for some miles across the country i believe this last great bed is covered by other nearly similar alternations but the section is here obscured by a tilt from the next porphyritic chain presently to be described i have given this section in detail as being illustrative of the general character of the mountains in this neighbourhood but it must not be supposed that any one stratum long preserves the same character at a distance of between only two and three miles the green mudstones and white indurated tuffs are to a great extent replaced by red sandstone and black calcareous shaly rocks alternating together the white indurated tuff bed here contains little or no gypsum whereas on the northern and opposite side of the valley it is of much greater thickness and abounds with layers of gypsum some of them alternating with thin seams of crystalline carbonate of lime the uppermost dark coloured hard mudstone bed is in this neighbourhood the most constant stratum the whole series differs to a considerable extent especially in its upper part from that met with at bb in the lower part of the valley nevertheless i do not doubt that they are equivalents fourth axis of elevation valley of copiapothis axis is formed of a chain of mountains f of which the central masses near la punta consist of andesite containing green hornblende and coppery mica and the outer masses of greenish and black porphyries together with some fine lilaccoloured claystone porphyry all these porphyries being injected and broken up by small hummocks of andesite the central great mass of this latter rock is covered on the eastern side by a black finegrained highly micaceous slate which together with the succeeding mountains of porphyry are traversed by numerous white dikes branching from the andesite and some of them extending in straight lines to a distance of a least two miles the mountains of porphyry eastward of the micaceous schist soon but gradually assume as observed in so many other cases a stratified structure and can then be recognized as a part of the porphyritic conglomerate formation these strata g are inclined at a high angle to the se and form a mass from to feet in thickness the gypseous masses to the west already described dip directly towards this axis with the strata only in a few places one of which is represented in the section thrown from it hence this fourth axis is mainly uniclinal towards the se and just like our third axis only locally anticlinal the above strata of porphyritic conglomerate g with their southeastward dip come abruptly up against beds of the gypseous formation h which are gently but irregularly inclined westward so that there is here a synclinal axis and great fault farther up the valley here running nearly north and south the gypseous formation is prolonged for some distance but the stratification is unintelligible the whole being broken up by faults dikes and metalliferous veins the strata consist chiefly of red calcareous sandstones with numerous veins in the place of layers of gypsum the sandstone is associated with some black calcareous slaterock and with green pseudohonestones passing into porcelainjasper still farther up the valley near las amolanas i the gypseous strata become more regular dipping at an angle of between and to wsw and conformably overlying near the mouth of the ravine of jolquera strata k of porphyritic conglomerate the whole series has been tilted by a partially concealed axis l of granite andesite and a granitic mixture of white feldspar quartz and oxide of iron fifth axis of elevation valley of copiapo near los amolanasi will describe in some detail the beds i seen here which as just stated dip to wsw at an angle of from to i had not time to examine the underlying porphyritic conglomerate of which the lowest beds as seen at the mouth of the jolquera are highly compact with crystals of red oxide of iron and i am not prepared to say whether they are chiefly of volcanic or metamorphic origin on these beds there rests a coarse purplish conglomerate very little metamorphosed composed of pebbles of porphyry but remarkable from containing one pebble of graniteof which fact no instance has occurred in the sections hitherto described above this conglomerate there is a black siliceous claystone and above it numerous alternations of darkpurplish and green porphyries which may be considered as the uppermost limit of the porphyritic conglomerate formation above these porphyries comes a coarse arenaceous conglomerate the lower half white and the upper half of a pink colour composed chiefly of pebbles of various porphyries but with some of red sandstone and jaspery rocks in some of the more arenaceous parts of the conglomerate there was an oblique or current lamination a circumstance which i did not elsewhere observe above this conglomerate there is a vast thickness of thinly stratified paleyellowish siliceous sandstone passing into a granular quartzrock used for grindstones hence the name of the place las amolanas and certainly belonging to the gypseous formation as does probably the immediately underlying conglomerate in this yellowish sandstone there are layers of white and palered siliceous conglomerate other layers with small wellrounded pebbles of white quartz like the bed at the r claro at coquimbo others of a greenish finegrained less siliceous stone somewhat resembling the pseudohonestones lower down the valley and lastly others of a black calcareous shalerock in one of the layers of conglomerate there was embedded a fragment of micaslate of which this is the first instance hence perhaps it is from a formation of micaslate that the numerous small pebbles of quartz both here and at coquimbo have been derived not only does the siliceous sandstone include layers of the black thinly stratified not fissile calcareous shalerock but in one place the whole mass especially the upper part was in a marvellously short horizontal distance after frequent alternations replaced by it when this occurred a mountainmass several thousand feet in thickness was thus composed the black calcareous shalerock however always included some layers of the paleyellowish siliceous sandstone of the red conglomerate and of the greenish jaspery and pseudohonestone varieties it likewise included three or four widely separated layers of a brown limestone abounding with shells immediately to be described this pile of strata was in parts traversed by many veins of gypsum the calcareous shalerock though when freshly broken quite black weathers into an ashcolour in which respect and in general appearance it perfectly resembles those great fossiliferous beds of the peuquenes range alternating with gypsum and red sandstone described in the last chapter the lower layers of the limestone contained thousands of the gryphæa and the upper ones as many of the turritella with the gryphæa nov spec and serpulæ adhering to them in all the layers the terebratula and fragments of the pecten were included it was evident from the manner in which the species were grouped together that they had lived where now embedded before making any further remarks i may state that higher up this same valley we shall again meet with a similar association of shells and in the great despoblado valley which branches off near the town from that of copiapo the pecten dufreynoyi some gryphites i believe g darwinii and the true terebratula ænigma of dorbigny were found together in an equivalent formation as will be hereafter seen a specimen also i may add of the true t ænigma was given me from the neighbourhood of the famous silver mines of chanuncillo a little south of the valley of copiapo and these mines from their position i have no doubt lie within the great gypseous formation the rocks close to one of the silver veins judging from fragments shown me resemble those singular metamorphosed deposits from the mining district of arqueros near coquimbo i will reiterate the evidence on the association of these several shells in the several localities considering this table i think it is impossible to doubt that all these fossils belong to the same formation if however the species from las amolanas in the valley of copiapo had as in the case of those from guasco been separately examined they would probably have been ranked as oolitic for although no spirifers were found here all the other species with the exception of the pecten turritella and astarte have a more ancient aspect than cretaceous forms on the other hand taking into account the evidence derived from the cretaceous character of these three shells and of the hippurites gryphæa orientalis and ostrea from coquimbo we are driven back to the provisional name already used of cretaceooolitic from geological evidence i believe this formation to be the equivalent of the neocomian beds of the cordillera of central chile to return to our section near las amolanas above the yellow siliceous sandstone or the equivalent calcareous slaterock with its bands of fossilshells according as the one or the other prevails there is a pile of strata which cannot be less than from to feet in thickness in main part composed of a coarse bright red conglomerate with many intercalated beds of red sandstone and some of green and other coloured porcelainjaspery layers the included pebbles are well rounded varying from the size of an egg to that of a cricketball with a few larger and they consist chiefly of porphyries the basis of the conglomerate as well as some of the alternating thin beds are formed of a red rather harsh easily fusible sandstone with crystalline calcareous particles this whole great pile is remarkable from the thousands of huge embedded silicified trunks of trees one of which was eight feet long and another eighteen feet in circumference how marvellous it is that every vessel in so thick a mass of wood should have been converted into silex i brought home many specimens and all of them according to mr r brown present a coniferous structure above this great conglomerate we have from to feet in thickness of red sandstone and above this a stratum of black calcareous slaterock like that which alternates with and replaces the underlying yellowish white siliceous sandstone close to the junction between this upper black slaterock and the upper red sandstone i found the gryphæa darwinii the turritella andii and vast numbers of a bivalve too imperfect to be recognised hence we see that as far as the evidence of these two shells servesand the turritella is an eminently characteristic speciesthe whole thickness of this vast pile of strata belongs to the same age again above the lastmentioned upper red sandstone there were several alternations of the black calcareous slaterock but i was unable to ascend to them all these uppermost strata like the lower ones vary extremely in character in short horizontal distances the gypseous formation as here seen has a coarser more mechanical texture and contains much more siliceous matter than the corresponding beds lower down the valley its total thickness together with the upper beds of the porphyritic conglomerate i estimated at least at feet and only a small portion of the porphyritic conglomerate which on the eastern flank of the fourth axis of elevation appeared to be from to feet thick is here included as corroborative of the great thickness of the gypseous formation i may mention that in the despoblado valley which branches from the main valley a little above the town of copiapo i found a corresponding pile of red and white sandstones and of dark calcareous semijaspery mudstones rising from a nearly level surface and thrown into an absolutely vertical position so that by pacing i ascertained their thickness to be nearly feet taking this as a standard of comparison i estimated the thickness of the strata above the porphyritic conglomerate at feet the fossils before enumerated from the limestonelayers in the whitish siliceous sandstone are now covered on the least computation by strata from to feet in thickness professor e forbes thinks that these shells probably lived at a depth of from about thirty to forty fathoms that is from to feet anyhow it is impossible that they could have lived at the depth of from to feet hence in this case as in that of the puente del inca we may safely conclude that the bottom of the sea on which the shells lived subsided so as to receive the superincumbent submarine strata and this subsidence must have taken place during the existence of these shells for as i have shown some of them occur high up as well as low down in the series that the bottom of the sea subsided is in harmony with the presence of the layers of coarse wellrounded pebbles included throughout this whole pile of strata as well as of the great upper mass of conglomerate from to feet thick for coarse gravel could hardly have been formed or spread out at the profound depths indicated by the thickness of the strata the subsidence also must have been slow to have allowed of this oftenrecurrent spreading out of the pebbles moreover we shall presently see that the surfaces of some of the streams of porphyritic lava beneath the gypseous formation are so highly amygdaloidal that it is scarcely possible to believe that they flowed under the vast pressure of a deep ocean the conclusion of a great subsidence during the existence of these cretaceooolitic fossils may i believe be extended to the district of coquimbo although owing to the fossiliferous beds there not being directly covered by the upper gypseous strata which in the section north of the valley are about feet in thickness i did not there insist on this conclusion the pebbles in the above conglomerates both in the upper and lower beds are all well rounded and though chiefly composed of various porphyries there are some of red sandstone and of a jaspery stone both like the rocks intercalated in layers in this same gypseous formation there was one pebble of micaslate and some of quartz together with many particles of quartz in these respects there is a wide difference between the gypseous conglomerates and those of the porphyriticconglomerate formation in which latter angular and rounded fragments almost exclusively composed of porphyries are mingled together and which as already often remarked probably were ejected from craters deep under the sea from these facts i conclude that during the formation of the conglomerates land existed in the neighbourhood on the shores of which the innumerable pebbles were rounded and thence dispersed and on which the coniferous forests flourishedfor it is improbable that so many thousand logs of wood should have been drifted from any great distance this land probably islands must have been mainly formed of porphyries with some micaslate whence the quartz was derived and with some red sandstone and jaspery rocks this latter fact is important as it shows that in this district even previously to the deposition of the lower gypseous or cretaceooolitic beds strata of an analogous nature had elsewhere no doubt in the more central ranges of the cordillera been elevated thus recalling to our minds the relations of the cumbre and uspallata chains having already referred to the great lateral valley of the despoblado i many mention that above the feet of red and white sandstone and dark mudstone there is a vast mass of coarse hard red conglomerate some thousand feet in thickness which contains much silicified wood and evidently corresponds with the great upper conglomerate at las amolanas here however the conglomerate consists almost exclusively of pebbles of granite and of disintegrated crystals of reddish feldspar and quartz firmly recemented together in this case we may conclude that the land whence the pebbles were derived and on which the now silicified trees once flourished was formed of granite the mountains near las amolanas composed of the cretaceooolitic strata are interlaced with dikes like a spiders web to an extent which i have never seen equalled except in the denuded interior of a volcanic crater north and south lines however predominate these dikes are composed of green white and blackish rocks all porphyritic with feldspar and often with large crystals of hornblende the white varieties approach closely in character to andesite which composes as we have seen the injected axes of so many of the lines of elevation some of the green varieties are finely laminated parallel to the walls of the dikes sixth axis of elevation valley of copiapothis axis consists of a broad mountainous mass o of andesite composed of albite brown mica and chlorite passing into andesitic granite with quartz on its western side it has thrown off at a considerable angle a thick mass of stratified porphyries including much epidote n n and remarkable only from being divided into very thin beds as highly amygdaloidal on their surfaces as subaërial lavastreams are often vesicular this porphyritic formation is conformably covered as seen some way up the ravine of jolquera by a mere remnant of the lower part of the cretaceooolitic formation m m which in one part encases as represented in the coloured section the foot of the andesitic axis l of the already described fifth line and in another part entirely conceals it in this latter case the gypseous or cretaceooolitic strata falsely appeared to dip under the porphyritic conglomerate of the fifth axis the lowest bed of the gypseous formation as seen here m is of yellowish siliceous sandstone precisely like that of amolanas interlaced in parts with veins of gypsum and including layers of the black calcareous nonfissile slaterock the turritella andii pecten dufreynoyi terebratula ænigma var and some gryphites were embedded in these layers the sandstone varies in thickness from only twenty to eighty feet and this variation is caused by the inequalities in the upper surface of an underlying stream of purple claystone porphyry hence the above fossils here lie at the very base of the gypseous or cretaceooolitic formation and hence they were probably once covered up by strata about feet in thickness it is however possible though from the nature of all the other sections in this district not probable that the porphyritic claystone lava may in this case have invaded a higher level in the series above the sandstone there is a considerable mass of much indurated purplishblack calcareous claystone allied in nature to the oftenmentioned black calcareous slaterock eastward of the broad andesitic axis of this sixth line and penetrated by many dikes from it there is a great formation p of micaschist with its usual variations and passing in one part into a ferruginous quartzrock the folio are curved and highly inclined generally dipping eastward it is probable that this micaschist is an old formation connected with the granitic rocks and metamorphic schists near the coast and that the one fragment of micaslate and the pebbles of quartz low down in the gypseous formation at las amolanas have been derived from it the micaschist is succeeded by stratified porphyritic conglomerate q of great thickness dipping eastward with a high inclination i have included this latter mountainmass in the same anticlinal axis with the porphyritic streams n n but i am far from sure that the two masses may not have been independently upheaved seventh axis of elevationproceeding up the ravine we come to another mass r of andesite and beyond this we again have a very thick stratified porphyritic formation s dipping at a small angle eastward and forming the basal part of the main cordillera i did not ascend the ravine any higher but here near castano i examined several sections of which i will not give the details only observing that the porphyritic beds or submarine lavas preponderate greatly in bulk over the alternating sedimentary layers which have been but little metamorphosed these latter consist of finegrained red tuffs and of whitish volcanic gritstones together with much of a singular compact rock having an almost crystalline basis finely brecciated with red and green fragments and occasionally including a few large pebbles the porphyritic lavas are highly amygdaloidal both on their upper and lower surfaces they consist chiefly of claystone porphyry but with one common variety like some of the streams at the puente del inca having a gray mottled basis abounding with crystals of red hydrous oxide of iron green ones apparently of epidote and a few glassy ones of feldspar this pile of strata differs considerably from the basal strata of the cordillera in central chile and may possibly belong to the upper and gypseous series i saw however in the bed of the valley one fragment of porphyritic brecciaconglomerate exactly like those great masses met with in the more southern parts of chile finally i must observe that though i have described between the town of copiapo and the western flank of the main cordillera seven or eight axes of elevation extending nearly north and south it must not be supposed that they all run continuously for great distances as was stated to be the case in our sections across the cordillera of central chile so here most of the lines of elevation with the exception of the first third and fifth are very short the stratification is everywhere disturbed and intricate nowhere have i seen more numerous faults and dikes the whole district from the sea to the cordillera is more or less metalliferous and i heard of gold silver copper lead mercury and iron veins the metamorphic action even in the lower strata has certainly been far less here than in central chile valley of the despobladothis great barren valley which has already been alluded to enters the main valley of copiapo a little above the town it runs at first northerly then ne and more easterly into the cordillera i followed its dreary course to the foot of the first main ridge i will not give a detailed section because it would be essentially similar to that already given and because the stratification is exceedingly complicated after leaving the plutonic hills near the town i met first as in the main valley with the gypseous formation having the same diversified character as before and soon afterwards with masses of porphyritic conglomerate about feet in thickness in the lower part of this formation there were very thick beds composed of fragments of claystone porphyries both angular and rounded with the smaller ones partially blended together and the basis rendered porphyritic these beds separated distinct streams from sixty to eighty feet in thickness of claystone lavas near paipote also there was much true porphyritic brecciaconglomerate nevertheless few of these masses were metamorphosed to the same degree with the corresponding formation in central chile i did not meet in this valley with any true andesite but only with imperfect andesitic porphyry including large crystals of hornblende numerous as have been the varieties of intrusive porphyries already mentioned there were here mountains composed of a new kind having a compact smooth creamcoloured basis including only a few crystals of feldspar and mottled with dendritic spots of oxide of iron there were also some mountains of a porphyry with a brickred basis containing irregular often lensshaped patches of compact feldspar and crystals of feldspar which latter to my surprise i find to be orthite at the foot of the first ridge of the main cordillera in the ravine of maricongo and at an elevation which from the extreme coldness and appearance of the vegetation i estimated at about feet i found beds of white sandstone and of limestone including the pecten dufreynoyi terebratula ænigma and some gryphites this ridge throws the water on the one hand into the pacific and on the other as i was informed into a great gravelcovered basinlike plain including a saltlake and without any drainageexit in crossing the cordillera by this pass it is said that three principal ridges must be traversed instead of two or only one as in central chile the crest of this first main ridge and the surrounding mountains with the exception of a few lofty pinnacles are capped by a great thickness of a horizontally stratified tufaceous deposit the lowest bed is of a pale purple colour hard finegrained and full of broken crystals of feldspar and scales of mica the middle bed is coarser and less hard and hence weathers into very sharp pinnacles it includes very small fragments of granite and innumerable ones of all sizes of gray vesicular trachyte some of which were distinctly rounded the uppermost bed is about feet in thickness of a darker colour and apparently hard but i had not time to ascend to it these three horizontal beds may be seen for the distance of many leagues especially westward or in the direction of the pacific capping the summits of the mountains and standing on the opposite sides of the immense valleys at exactly corresponding heights if united they would form a plain inclined very slightly towards the pacific the beds become thinner in this direction and the tuff judging from one point to which i ascended some way down the valley finergrained and of less specific gravity though still compact and sonorous under the hammer the gently inclined almost horizontal stratification the presence of some rounded pebbles and the compactness of the lowest bed though rendering it probable would not have convinced me that this mass had been of subaqueous origin for it is known that volcanic ashes falling on land and moistened by rain often become hard and stratified but beds thus originating and owing their consolidation to atmospheric moisture would have covered almost equally every neighbouring summit high and low and would not have left those above a certain exact level absolutely bare this circumstance seems to me to prove that the volcanic ejections were arrested at their present widely extended equable level and there consolidated by some other means than simple atmospheric moisture and this no doubt must have been a sheet of water a lake at this great height and without a barrier on any one side is out of the question consequently we must conclude that the tufaceous matter was anciently deposited beneath the sea it was certainly deposited before the excavation of the valleys or at least before their final enlargement and i may add that mr lambert a gentleman well acquainted with this country informs me that in ascending the ravine of santandres which branches off from the despoblado he met with streams of lava and much erupted matter capping all the hills of granite and porphyry with the exception of some projecting points he also remarked that the valleys had been excavated subsequently to these eruptions this volcanic formation which i am informed by mr lambert extends far northward is of interest as typifying what has taken place on a grander scale on the corresponding western side of the cordillera of peru under another point of view however it possesses a far higher interest as confirming that conclusion drawn from the structure of the fringes of stratified shingle which are prolonged from the plains at the foot of the cordillera far up the valleysnamely that this great range has been elevated in mass to a height of between and feet and now judging from this tufaceous deposit we may conclude that the horizontal elevation has been in the district of copiapo about feet in the valley of the despoblado the stratification as before remarked has been much disturbed and in some points to a greater degree than i have anywhere else seen i will give two cases a very thick mass of thinly stratified red sandstone including beds of conglomerate has been crushed together as represented in the woodcut into a yoke or urnformed trough so that the strata on both sides have been folded inwards on the right hand the properly underlying porphyritic claystone conglomerate is seen overlying the sandstone but it soon becomes vertical and then is inclined towards the trough so that the beds radiate like the spokes of a wheel on the left hand the inverted porphyritic conglomerate also assumes a dip towards the trough not gradually as on the right hand but by means of a vertical fault and synclinal break and a little still farther on towards the left there is a second great oblique fault both shown by the arrowlines with the strata dipping to a directly opposite point these mountains are intersected by infinitely numerous dikes some of which can be seen to rise from hummocks of greenstone and can be traced for thousands of feet in the second case two low ridges trend together and unite at the head of a little wedgeshaped valley throughout the righthand ridge the strata dip at to the east in the lefthand ridge we have the very same strata and at first with exactly the same dip but in following this ridge up the valley the strata are seen very regularly to become more and more inclined until they stand vertical they then gradually fall over the basset edges forming symmetrical serpentine lines along the crest till at the very head of the valley they are reversed at an angle of so that at this point the beds have been turned through an angle of and here there is a kind of anticlinal axis with the strata on both sides dipping to opposite points at an angle of but with those on the left hand upsidedown on the eruptive sources of the porphyritic claystone and greenstone lavasin central chile from the extreme metamorphic action it is in most parts difficult to distinguish between the streams of porphyritic lava and the porphyritic brecciaconglomerate but here at copiapo they are generally perfectly distinct and in the despoblado i saw for the first time two great strata of purple claystone porphyry after having been for a considerable space closely united together one above the other become separated by a mass of fragmentary matter and then both thin outthe lower one more rapidly than the upper and greater stream considering the number and thickness of the streams of porphyritic lava and the great thickness of the beds of brecciaconglomerate there can be little doubt that the sources of eruption must originally have been numerous nevertheless it is now most difficult even to conjecture the precise point of any one of the ancient submarine craters i have repeatedly observed mountains of porphyries more or less distinctly stratified towards their summits or on their flanks without a trace of stratification in their central and basal parts in most cases i believe this is simply due either to the obliterating effects of metamorphic action or to such parts having been mainly formed of intrusive porphyries or to both causes conjoined in some instances however it appeared to me very probable that the great central unstratified masses of porphyry were the now partially denuded nuclei of the old submarine volcanos and that the stratified parts marked the points whence the streams flowed in one case alone and it was in this valley of the despoblado i was able actually to trace a thick stratum of purplish porphyry which for a space of some miles conformably overlay the usual alternating beds of brecciaconglomerates and claystone lavas until it became united with and blended into a mountainous mass of various unstratified porphyries the difficulty of tracing the streams of porphyries to their ancient and doubtless numerous eruptive sources may be partly explained by the very general disturbance which the cordillera in most parts has suffered but i strongly suspect that there is a more specific cause namely that the original points of eruption tend to become the points of injection this in itself does not seem improbable for where the earths crust has once yielded it would be liable to yield again though the liquefied intrusive matter might not be any longer enabled to reach the submarine surface and flow as lava i have been led to this conclusion from having so frequently observed that where part of an unstratified mountainmass resembled in mineralogical character the adjoining streams or strata there were several other kinds of intrusive porphyries and andesitic rocks injected into the same point as these intrusive mountainmasses form most of the axeslines in the cordillera whether anticlinal uniclinal or synclinal and as the main valleys have generally been hollowed out along these lines the intrusive masses have generally suffered much denudation hence they are apt to stand in some degree isolated and to be situated at the points where the valleys abruptly bend or where the main tributaries enter on this view of there being a tendency in the old points of eruption to become the points of subsequent injection and disturbance and consequently of denudation it ceases to be surprising that the streams of lava in the porphyritic claystone conglomerate formation and in other analogous cases should most rarely be traceable to their actual sources iquique southern perudifferently from what we have seen throughout chile the coast here is formed not by the granitic series but by an escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate formation between and feet in height i had time only for a very short examination the chief part of the escarpment appears to be composed of various reddish and purple sometimes laminated porphyries resembling those of chile and i saw some of the porphyritic brecciaconglomerate the stratification appeared but little inclined the uppermost part judging from the rocks near the famous silver mine of huantajaya consists of laminated impure argillaceous purplishgray limestone associated i believe with some purple sandstone in the limestone shells are found this latter species we have seen associated with the fossils of which lists have been given in this chapter in two places in the valley of coquimbo and in the ravine of maricongo at copiapo considering this fact and the superposition of these beds on the porphyritic conglomerate formation and as we shall immediately see from their containing much gypsum and from their otherwise close general resemblance in mineralogical nature with the strata described in the valley of copiapo i have little doubt that these fossiliferous beds of iquique belong to the great cretaceooolitic formation of northern chile iquique is situated seven degrees latitude north of copiapo and i may here mention that an ammonites nov spec and astarte nov spec were given me from the cerro pasco about ten degrees of latitude north of iquique and m dorbigny thinks that they probably indicate a neocomian formation again fifteen degrees of latitude northward in colombia there is a grand fossiliferous deposit now well known from the labours of von buch lea dorbigny and forbes which belongs to the earlier stages of the cretaceous system hence bearing in mind the character of the few fossils from tierra del fuego there is some evidence that a great portion of the stratified deposits of the whole vast range of the south american cordillera belongs to about the same geological epoch proceeding from the coast escarpment inwards i crossed in a space of about thirty miles an elevated undulatory district with the beds dipping in various directions the rocks are of many kindswhite laminated sometimes siliceous sandstonepurple and red sandstone sometimes so highly calcareous as to have a crystalline fractureargillaceous limestoneblack calcareous slaterock like that so often described at copiapo and other placesthinly laminated finegrained

porcelain jasper of a green colour with red spots and of extremely easy fusibility i noticed one conformable stratum of a freckledbrown feldspathic lava i may here mention that i heard of great beds of gypsum in the cordillera the only novel point in this formation is the presence of innumerable thin layers of rocksalt alternating with the laminated and hard but sometimes earthy yellowish or bright red and ferruginous sandstones the thickest layer of salt was only two inches and it thinned out at both ends on one of these saliferous masses i noticed a stratum about twelve feet thick of darkbrown hard brecciated easily fusible rock containing grains of quartz and of black oxide of iron together with numerous imperfect fragments of shells the problem of the origin of salt is so obscure that every fact even geographical position is worth recording with the exception of these saliferous beds most of the rocks as already remarked present a striking general resemblance with the upper parts of the gypseous or cretaceooolitic formation of chile metalliferous veins i have only a few remarks to make on this subject in nine mining districts some of them of considerable extent which i visited in central chile i found the principal veins running from between n and nw to s and se in some other places however their course appeared quite irregular as is said to be generally the case in the whole valley of copiapo at tambillos south of coquimbo i saw one large copper vein extending east and west it is worthy of notice that the foliation of the gneiss and micaslate and the cleavage of the altered clayslate where such rocks occur certainly tend to run like the metalliferous veins though often irregularly in a direction a little westward of north at yaquil i observed that the principal auriferous veins ran nearly parallel to the grain or imperfect cleavage of the surrounding granitic rocks not only is salt abundant on the extreme western limits of the district between the cordillera and the pacific but according to helms it is found in the outlying low hills on the eastern flank of the cordillera these facts appear to me opposed to the theory that rocksalt is due to the sinking of water charged with salt in mediterranean spaces of the ocean the general character of the geology of these countries would rather lead to the opinion that its origin is in some way connected with volcanic heat at the bottom of the sea see on this subject sir r murchisons anniversary address to geolog soc p with respect to the distribution of the different metals copper gold and iron are generally associated together and are most frequently found but with many exceptions as we shall presently see in the rocks of the lower series between the cordillera and the pacific namely in granite syenite altered feldspathic clayslate gneiss and as near guasco micaschist the copperores consist of sulphurets oxides and carbonates sometimes with laminæ of native metal i was assured that in some cases as at panuncillo se of coquimbo the upper part of the same vein contains oxides and the lower part sulphurets of copper gold occurs in its native form it is believed that in many cases the upper part of the vein is the most productive part this fact probably is connected with the abundance of this metal in the stratified detritus of chile which must have been chiefly derived from the degradation of the upper portions of the rocks these superficial beds of wellrounded gravel and sand containing gold appeared to me to have been formed under the sea close to the beach during the slow elevation of the land schmidtmeyer remarks that in chile gold is sought for in shelving banks at the height of some feet on the sides of the streams and not in their beds as would have been the case had this metal been deposited by common alluvial action very frequently the copperores including some gold are associated with abundant micaceous specular iron gold is often found in ironpyrites at two gold mines at yaquil near nancagua i was informed by the proprietor that in one the gold was always associated with copperpyrites and in the other with ironpyrites in this latter case it is said that if the vein ceases to contain ironpyrites it is yet worth while to continue the search but if the ironpyrites when it reappears is not auriferous it is better at once to give up working the vein although i believe copper and gold are most frequently found in the lower granitic and metamorphic schistose series yet these metals occur both in the porphyritic conglomerate formation as on the flanks of the bell of quillota and at jajuel and in the superincumbent strata at jajuel i was informed that the copperore with some gold is found only in the greenstones and altered feldspathic clayslate which alternate with the purple porphyritic conglomerate several gold veins and some of copperore are worked in several parts of the uspallata range both in the metamorphosed strata which have been shown to have been of probably subsequent origin to the neocomian or gypseous formation of the main cordillera and in the intrusive andesitic rocks of that range at los hornos ne of illapel likewise there are numerous veins of copperpyrites and of gold both in the strata of the gypseous formation and in the injected hills of andesite and various porphyries silver in the form of a chloride sulphuret or an amalgam or in its native state and associated with lead and other metals and at arqueros with pure native copper occurs chiefly in the upper great gypseous or cretaceooolitic formation which forms probably the richest mass in chile we may instance the mining districts of arqueros near coquimbo and of nearly the whole valley of copiapo and of iquique where the principal veins run ne by e and sw by w in peru hence comes molinas remark that silver is born in the cold and solitary deserts of the upper cordillera there are however exceptions to this rule at paral se of coquimbo silver is found in the porphyritic conglomerate formation as i suspect is likewise the case at s pedro de nolasko in the peuquenes pass rich argentiferous lead is found in the clayslate of the uspallata range and i saw an old silver mine in a hill of syenite at the foot of the bell of quillota i was also assured that silver has been found in the andesitic and porphyritic region between the town of copiapo and the pacific i have stated in a previous part of this chapter that in two neighbouring mines at arqueros the veins in one were productive when they traversed the singular green sedimentary beds and unproductive when crossing the reddish beds whereas at the other mine exactly the reverse takes place i have also described the singular and rare case of numerous particles of native silver and of the chloride being disseminated in the green rock at the distance of a yard from the vein mercury occurs with silver both at arqueros and at copiapo at the base of c de los hornos se of coquimbo a different place from los hornos before mentioned i saw in a syenitic rock numerous quartzose veins containing a little cinnabar in nests there were here other parallel veins of copper and of a ferruginoauriferous ore i believe tin has never been found in chile from information given me by mr nixon of yaquil and by others it appears that in chile those veins are generally most permanently productive which consisting of various minerals sometimes differing but slightly from the surrounding rocks include parallel strings rich in metals such a vein is called a veta real more commonly the mines are worked only where one two or more thin veins or strings running in a different direction intersect a poor veta real it is unanimously believed that at such points of intersection cruceros the quantity of metal is much greater than that contained in other parts of the intersecting veins in some cruceros or points of intersection the metals extend even beyond the walls of the main broad stony vein it is said that the greater the angle of intersection the greater the produce and that nearly parallel strings attract each other in the uspallata range i observed that numerous thin auriferruginous veins repeatedly ran into knots and then branched out again i have already described the remarkable manner in which rocks of the uspallata range are indurated and blackened as if by a blast of gunpowder to a considerable distance from the metallic veins finally i may observe that the presence of metallic veins seems obviously connected with the presence of intrusive rocks and with the degree of metamorphic action which the different districts of chile have undergone such metamorphosed areas are generally accompanied by numerous dikes and injected masses of andesite and various porphyries i have in several places traced the metalliferous veins from the intrusive masses into the encasing strata knowing that the porphyritic conglomerate formation consists of alternate streams of submarine lavas and of the débris of anciently erupted rocks and that the strata of the upper gypseous formation sometimes include submarine lavas and are composed of tuffs mudstones and mineral substances probably due to volcanic exhalationsthe richness of these strata is highly remarkable when compared with the erupted beds often of submarine origin but not metamorphosed which compose the numerous islands in the pacific indian and atlantic oceans for in these islands metals are entirely absent and their nature even unknown to the aborigines summary on the geological history of the chilian cordillera and of the southern parts of south america we have seen that the shores of the pacific for a space of miles from tres montes to copiapo and i believe for a very much greater distance are composed with the exception of the tertiary basins of metamorphic schists plutonic rocks and more or less altered clayslate on the floor of the ocean thus constituted vast streams of various purplish claystone and greenstone porphyries were poured forth together with great alternating piles of angular and rounded fragments of similar rocks ejected from the submarine craters from the compactness of the streams and fragments it is probable that with the exception of some districts in northern chile the eruptions took place in profoundly deep water the orifices of eruption appear to have been studded over a breadth with some outliers of from to miles and closely enough together both north and south and east and west for the ejected matter to form a continuous mass which in central chile is more than a mile in thickness i traced this mouldlike mass for only miles but judging from what i saw at iquique from specimens and from published accounts it appears to have a manifold greater length in the basal parts of the series and especially towards the flanks of the range mud since converted into a feldspathic slaty rock and sometimes into greenstone was occasionally deposited between the beds of erupted matter with this exception the uniformity of the porphyritic rocks is very remarkable at the period when the claystone and greenstone porphyries nearly or quite ceased being erupted that great pile of strata which from often abounding with gypsum i have generally called the gypseous formation was deposited and feldspathic lavas together with other singular volcanic rocks were occasionally poured forth i am far from pretending that any distinct line of demarkation can be drawn between this formation and the underlying porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate but in a mass of such great thickness and between beds of such widely different mineralogical nature some division was necessary at about the commencement of the gypseous period the bottom of the sea here seems first to have been peopled by shells not many in kind but abounding in individuals at the p del inca the fossils are embedded near the base of the formation in the peuquenes range at different levels halfway up and even higher in the series hence in these sections the whole great pile of strata belongs to the same period the same remark is applicable to the beds at copiapo which attain a thickness of between and feet the fossil shells in the cordillera of central chile in the opinion of all the palæontologists who have examined them belong to the earlier stages of the cretaceous system whilst in northern chile there is a most singular mixture of cretaceous and oolitic forms from the geological relations however of these two districts i cannot but think that they all belong to nearly the same epoch which i have provisionally called cretaceooolitic the strata in this formation composed of black calcareous shalyrocks of red and white and sometimes siliceous sandstones of coarse conglomerates limestones tuffs dark mudstones and those singular finegrained rocks which i have called pseudohonestones vast beds of gypsum and many other jaspery and scarcely describable varieties vary and replace each other in short horizontal distances to an extent i believe unequalled even in any tertiary basin most of these substances are easily fusible and have apparently been derived either from volcanos still in quiet action or from the attrition of volcanic products if we picture to ourselves the bottom of the sea rendered uneven in an extreme degree with numerous craters some few occasionally in eruption but the greater number in the state of solfataras discharging calcareous siliceous ferruginous matters and gypsum or sulphuric acid to an amount surpassing perhaps even the existing sulphureous volcanos of java we shall probably understand the circumstances under which this singular pile of varying strata was accumulated the shells appear to have lived at the quiescent periods when only limestone or calcareoargillaceous matter was depositing from dr gilliess account this gypseous or cretaceooolitic formation extends as far south as the pass of planchon and i followed it northward at intervals for miles judging from the character of the beds with the terebratula ænigma at iquique it extends from to miles farther and perhaps even for ten degrees of latitude north of iquique to the cerro pasco not far from lima again we know that a cretaceous formation abounding with fossils is largely developed north of the equator in columbia in tierra del fuego at about this same period a wide district of clayslate was deposited which in its mineralogical characters and external features might be compared to the silurian regions of north wales the gypseous formation like that of the porphyritic brecciaconglomerate on which its rests is of inconsiderable breadth though of greater breadth in northern than in central chile as the fossil shells in this formation are covered in the peuquenes ridge by a great thickness of strata at the puente del inca by at least feet at coquimbo though the superposition there is less plainly seen by about feet and at copiapo certainly by or and probably by feet the same species there recurring in the upper and lower parts of the series we may feel confident that the bottom of the sea subsided during this cretaceooolitic period so as to allow of the accumulation of the superincumbent submarine strata this conclusion is confirmed by or perhaps rather explains the presence of the many beds at many levels of coarse conglomerate the wellrounded pebbles in which we cannot believe were transported in very deep water even the underlying porphyries at copiapo with their highly amygdaloidal surfaces do not appear to have flowed under great pressure the great sinking movement thus plainly indicated must have extended in a north and south line for at least miles and probably was coextensive with the gypseous formation the beds of conglomerate just referred to and the extraordinarily numerous silicified trunks of firtrees at los hornos perhaps at coquimbo and at two distant points in the valley of copiapo indicate that land existed at this period in the neighbourhood this land or islands in the northern part of the district of copiapo must have been almost exclusively composed judging from the nature of the pebbles of granite in the southern parts of copiapo it must have been mainly formed of claystone porphyries with some micaschist and with much sandstone and jaspery rocks exactly like the rocks in the gypseous formation and no doubt belonging to its basal series in several other places also during the accumulation of the gypseous formation its basal parts and the underlying porphyritic conglomerate must likewise have been already partially upheaved and exposed to wear and tear near the puente del inca and at coquimbo there must have existed masses of micaschist or some such rock whence were derived the many small pebbles of opaque quartz it follows from these facts that in some parts of the cordillera the upper beds of the gypseous formation must lie unconformably on the lower beds and the whole gypseous formation in parts unconformably on the porphyritic conglomerate although i saw no such cases yet in many places the gypseous formation is entirely absent and this although no doubt generally caused by quite subsequent denudation may in others be due to the underlying porphyritic conglomerate having been locally upheaved before the deposition of the gypseous strata and thus having become the source of the pebbles of porphyry embedded in them in the porphyritic conglomerate formation in its lower and middle parts there is very rarely any evidence with the exception of the small quartz pebbles at jajuel near aconcagua and of the single pebble of granite at copiapo of the existence of neighbouring land in the upper parts however and especially in the district of copiapo the number of thoroughly wellrounded pebbles of compact porphyries make me believe that as during the prolonged accumulation of the gyseous formation the lower beds had already been locally upheaved and exposed to wear and tear so it was with the porphyritic conglomerate hence in following thus far the geological history of the cordillera it may be inferred that the bed of a deep and open or nearly open ocean was filled up by porphyritic eruptions aided probably by some general and some local elevations so that comparatively shallow level at which the cretaceooolitic shells first lived at this period the submarine craters yielded at intervals a prodigious supply of gypsum and other mineral exhalations and occasionally in certain places poured forth lavas chiefly of a feldspathic nature at this period islands clothed with firtrees and composed of porphyries primary rocks and the lower gypseous strata had already been locally upheaved and exposed to the action of the wavesthe general movement however at this time having been over a very wide area one of slow
