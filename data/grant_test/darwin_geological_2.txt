fragments these angular pseudo fragments consist of the firstdescribed dark green rock of a brown softer kind of serpentine and of a yellowish harsh stone which perhaps is related to serpentine rock there are other vesicular calcareoferruginous soft stones there is no distinct stratification but parts are imperfectly laminated and the whole abounds with innumerable veins and veinlike masses both small and large of these veinlike masses some calcareous ones which contain minute fragments of shells are clearly of subsequent origin to the others a glossy incrustationextensive portions of these rocks are coated by a layer of a glossy polished substance with a pearly lustre and of a grayish white colour it follows all the inequalities of the surface to which it is firmly attached when examined with a lens it is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers their aggregate thickness being about the tenth of an inch it is considerably harder than calcareous spar but can be scratched with a knife under the blowpipe it scales off decrepitates slightly blackens emits a fetid odour and becomes strongly alkaline it does not effervesce in acids i presume this substance has been deposited by water draining from the birds dung with which the rocks are covered at ascension near a cavity in the rocks which was filled with a laminated mass of infiltrated birds dung i found some irregularlyformed stalactitical masses of apparently the same nature these masses when broken had an earthy texture but on their outsides and especially at their extremities they were formed of a pearly substance generally in little globules like the enamel of teeth but more translucent and so hard as just to scratch plateglass this substance slightly blackens under the blowpipe emits a bad smell then becomes quite white swelling a little and fuses into a dull white enamel it does not become alkaline nor does it effervesce in acids the whole mass had a collapsed appearance as if in the formation of the hard glossy crust the whole had shrunk much at the abrolhos islands on the coast of brazil where also there is much birds dung i found a great quantity of a brown arborescent substance adhering to some traprock in its arborescent form this substance singularly resembles some of the branched species of nullipora under the blowpipe it behaves like the specimens from ascension but it is less hard and glossy and the surface has not the shrunk appearance chapter iii ascension basaltic lavasnumerous craters truncated on the same sidesingular structure of volcanic

of an irregular triangle see accompanying map each side being about six miles in length its highest point is feet above the level of the sea the whole is volcanic and from the absence of proofs to the contrary i believe of subaërial origin the fundamental rock is everywhere of a pale colour generally compact and of a feldspathic nature in the se portion of the island where the highest land is situated well characterised trachyte and other congenerous rocks of that varying family occur nearly the entire circumference is covered up by black and rugged streams of basaltic lava with here and there a hill or single point of rock one of which near the seacoast north of the fort is only two or three yards across of the trachyte still remaining exposed many of the basaltic streams can be traced either to points of eruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte or to separate conical redcoloured hills which are scattered over the northern and western borders of the island standing on the central eminence i counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of eruption the greater number of them had their truncated summits cut off obliquely and they all sloped towards the se whence the tradewind blows this structure no doubt has been caused by the ejected fragments and ashes being always blown during eruptions in greater quantity towards one side than towards the other m moreau de jonnès has made a similar observation with respect to the volcanic orifices in the west indian islands volcanic bombsthese occur in great numbers strewed on the ground and some of them lie at considerable distances from any points of eruption they vary in size from that of an apple to that of a mans body they are either spherical or pearshaped or with the hinder part corresponding to the tail of a comet irregular studded with projecting points and even concave their surfaces are rough and fissured with branching cracks their internal structure is either irregularly scoriaceous and compact or it presents a symmetrical and very curious appearance an irregular segment of a bomb of this latter kind of which i found several is accurately represented in the accompanying woodcut its size was about that of a mans head the whole interior is coarsely cellular the cells averaging in diameter about the tenth of an inch but nearer the outside they gradually decrease in size this part is succeeded by a welldefined shell of compact lava having a nearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch and the shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely cellular lava the cells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter which forms the external surface the line separating the shell of compact lava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined this structure is very simply explained if we suppose a mass of viscid scoriaceous matter to be projected with a rapid rotatory motion through the air for whilst the external crust from cooling became solidified in the state we now see it the centrifugal force by relieving the pressure in the interior parts of the bomb would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells but these being driven by the same force against the alreadyhardened crust would become the nearer they were to this part smaller and smaller or less expanded until they became packed into a solid concentric shell as we know that chips from a grindstone can be flirted off when made to revolve with sufficient velocity we need not doubt that the centrifugal force would have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb in the manner here supposed geologists have remarked that the external form of a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its aërial course and we now see that the internal structure can speak with almost equal plainness of its rotatory movement aëriform explosionsthe flanks of green mountain and the surrounding country are covered by a great mass some hundred feet in thickness of loose fragments the lower beds generally consist of finegrained slightly consolidated tuffs and the upper beds of great loose fragments with alternating finer beds one white ribbonlike layer of decomposed pumiceous breccia was curiously bent into deep unbroken curves beneath each of the larger fragments in the superincumbent stratum from the relative position of these beds i presume that a narrowmouthed crater standing nearly in the position of green mountain like a great airgun shot forth before its final extinction this vast accumulation of loose matter subsequently to this event considerable dislocations have taken place and an oval circus has been formed by subsidence this sunken space lies at the northeastern foot of green mountain and is well represented in the accompanying map its longer axis which is connected with a ne and sw line of fissure is threefifths of a nautical mile in length its sides are nearly perpendicular except in one spot and about feet in height they consist in the lower part of a pale basalt with feldspar and in the upper part of the tuff and loose ejected fragments the bottom is smooth and level and under almost any other climate a deep lake would have been formed here from the thickness of the bed of loose fragments with which the surrounding country is covered the amount of aëriform matter necessary for their projection must have been enormous hence we may suppose it probable that after the explosions vast subterranean caverns were left and that the falling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here described at the galapagos archipelago pits of a similar character but of a much smaller size frequently occur at the bases of small cones of eruption ejected granitic fragmentsin the neighbourhood of green mountain fragments of extraneous rock are not unfrequently found embedded in the midst of masses of scoriæ lient evans to whose kindness i am indebted for much information gave me several specimens and i found others myself they nearly all have a granitic structure are brittle harsh to the touch and apparently of altered colours first a white syenite streaked and mottled with red it consists of well crystallised feldspar numerous grains of quartz and brilliant though small crystals of hornblende the feldspar and hornblende in this and the succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting goniometer and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe the feldspar in these ejected fragments like the glassy kind in the trachyte is from its cleavage a potashfeldspar secondly a brickred mass of feldspar quartz and small dark patches of a decayed mineral one minute particle of which i was able to ascertain by its cleavage to be hornblende thirdly a mass of confusedly crystallised white feldspar with little nests of a dark coloured mineral often carious externally rounded having a glossy fracture but no distinct cleavage from comparison with the second specimen i have no doubt that it is fused hornblende fourthly a rock which at first appears a simple aggregation of distinct and largesized crystals of duskycoloured labrador feldspar but in their interstices there is some white granular feldspar abundant scales of mica a little altered hornblende and as i believe no quartz i have described these fragments in detail because it is rare to find granitic rocks ejected from volcanos with their minerals unchanged as is the case with the first specimen and partially with the second one other large fragment found in another spot is deserving of notice it is a conglomerate containing small fragments of granitic cellular and jaspery rocks and of hornstone porphyries embedded in a base of wacke threaded by numerous thin layers of a concretionary pitchstone passing into obsidian these layers are parallel slightly tortuous and short they thin out at their ends and resemble in form the layers of quartz in gneiss it is probable that these small embedded fragments were not separately ejected but were entangled in a fluid volcanic rock allied to obsidian and we shall presently see that several varieties of this latter series of rock assume a laminated structure trachytic series of rocksthose occupy the more elevated and central and likewise the southeastern parts of the island the trachyte is generally of a pale brown colour stained with small darker patches it contains broken and bent crystals of glassy feldspar grains of specular iron and black microscopical points which latter from being easily fused and then becoming magnetic i presume are hornblende the greater number of the hills however are composed of a quite white friable stone appearing like a trachytic tuff obsidian hornstone and several kinds of laminated feldspathic rocks are associated with the trachyte there is no distinct stratification nor could i distinguish a crateriform structure in any of the hills of this series considerable dislocations have taken place and many fissures in these rocks are yet left open or are only partially filled with loose fragments within the space mainly formed of trachyte some basaltic streams have burst forth and not far from the summit of green mountain there is one stream of quite black vesicular basalt containing minute crystals of glassy feldspar which have a rounded appearance the soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its singular resemblance when viewed in mass to a sedimentary tuff it was long before i could persuade myself that such was not its origin and other geologists have been perplexed by closely similar formations in trachytic regions in two cases this white earthy stone formed isolated hills in a third it was associated with columnar and laminated trachyte but i was unable to trace an actual junction it contains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and black microscopical specks and is marked with small darker patches exactly as in the surrounding trachyte its basis however when viewed under the microscope is generally quite earthy but sometimes it exhibits a decidedly crystalline structure on the hill marked crater of an old volcano it passes into a pale greenishgray variety differing only in its colour and in not being so earthy the passage was in one case effected insensibly in another it was formed by numerous rounded and angular masses of the greenish variety being embedded in the white varietyin this latter case the appearance was very much like that of a sedimentary deposit torn up and abraded during the deposition of a subsequent stratum both these varieties are traversed by innumerable tortuous veins presently to be described which are totally unlike injected dikes or indeed any other veins which i have ever seen both varieties include a few scattered fragments large and small of darkcoloured scoriaceous rocks the cells of some of which are partially filled with the white earthy stone they likewise include some huge blocks of a cellular porphyry these fragments project from the weathered surface and perfectly resemble fragments embedded in a true sedimentary tuff but as it is known that extraneous fragments of cellular rock are sometimes included in columnar trachyte in phonolite and in other compact lavas this circumstance is not any real argument for the sedimentary origin of the white earthy stone the insensible passage of the greenish variety into the white one and likewise the more abrupt passage by fragments of the former being embedded in the latter might result from slight differences in the composition of the same mass of molten stone and from the abrading action of one such part still fluid on another part already solidified the curiously formed veins have i believe been formed by siliceous matter being subsequently segregated but my chief reason for believing that these soft earthy stones with their extraneous fragments are not of sedimentary origin is the extreme improbability of crystals of feldspar black microscopical specks and small stains of a darker colour occurring in the same proportional numbers in an aqueous deposit and in masses of solid trachyte moreover as i have remarked the microscope occasionally reveals a crystalline structure in the apparently earthy basis on the other hand the partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte forming whole mountains is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy explanation veins in the earthy trachytic massesthese veins are extraordinarily numerous intersecting in the most complicated manner both coloured varieties of the earthy trachyte they are best seen on the flanks of the crater of the old volcano they contain crystals of glassy feldspar black microscopical specks and little dark stains precisely as in the surrounding rock but the basis is very different being exceedingly hard compact somewhat brittle and of rather less easy fusibility the veins vary much and suddenly from the tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness they often thin out not only on their edges but in their central parts thus leaving round irregular apertures their surfaces are rugged they are inclined at every possible angle with the horizon or are horizontal they are generally curvilinear and often interbranch one with another from their hardness they withstand weathering and projecting two or three feet above the ground they occasionally extend some yards in length these platelike veins when struck emit a sound almost like that of a drum and they may be distinctly seen to vibrate their fragments which are strewed on the ground clatter like pieces of iron when knocked against each other they often assume the most singular forms i saw a pedestal of the earthy trachyte covered by a hemispherical portion of a vein like a great umbrella sufficiently large to shelter two persons i have never met with or seen described any veins like these but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams due to some process of segregation occurring not uncommonly in sandstonesfor instance in the new red sandstone of england numerous veins of jasper and of siliceous sinter occurring on the summit of this same hill show that there has been some abundant source of silica and as these platelike veins differ from the trachyte only in their greater hardness brittleness and less easy fusibility it appears probable that their origin is due to the segregation or infiltration of siliceous matter in the same manner as happens with the oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks siliceous sinter and jasperthe siliceous sinter is either quite white of little specific gravity and with a somewhat pearly fracture passing into pinkish pearly quartz or it is yellowish white with a harsh fracture and it then contains an earthy powder in small cavities both varieties occur either in large irregular masses in the altered trachyte or in seams included in broad vertical tortuous irregular veins of a compact harsh stone of a dull red colour appearing like a sandstone this stone however is only altered trachyte and a nearly similar variety but often honeycombed sometimes adheres to the projecting platelike veins described in the last paragraph the jasper is of an ochre yellow or red colour it occurs in large irregular masses and sometimes in veins both in the altered trachyte and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt the cells of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or filled with fine concentric layers of chalcedony coated and studded with brightred oxide of iron in this rock especially in the rather more compact parts irregular angular patches of the red jasper are included the edges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding mass other patches occur having an intermediate character between perfect jasper and the ferruginous decomposed basaltic base in these patches and likewise in the large veinlike masses of jasper there occur little rounded cavities of exactly the same size and form with the aircells which in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined with layers of chalcedony small fragments of the jasper examined under the microscope seem to resemble the chalcedony with its colouring matter not separated into layers but mingled in the siliceous paste together with some impurities i can understand these factsnamely the blending of the jasper into the semidecomposed basaltits occurrence in angular patches which clearly do not occupy preexisting hollows in the rockand its containing little vesicles filled with chalcedony like those in the scoriaceous lavaonly on the supposition that a fluid probably the same fluid which deposited the chalcedony in the aircells removed in those parts where there were no cavities the ingredients of the basaltic rock and left in their place silica and iron and thus produced the jasper in some specimens of silicified wood i have observed that in the same manner as in the basalt the solid parts were converted into a darkcoloured homogeneous stone whereas the cavities formed by the larger sapvessels which may be compared with the airvesicles in the basaltic lava and other irregular hollows apparently produced by decay were filled with concentric layers of chalcedony in this case there can be little doubt that the same fluid deposited the homogeneous base and the chalcedonic layers after these considerations i cannot doubt but that the jasper of ascension may be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified in precisely the same sense as this term is applied to wood when silicified we are equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of wood whilst in a perfect state is removed and replaced by atoms of silica as we are of the means by which the constituent parts of a volcanic rock could be thus acted on i was led to the careful examination of these rocks and to the conclusion here given from having heard the rev professor henslow express a similar opinion regarding the origin in traprocks of many chalcedonies and agates siliceous deposits seem to be very general if not of universal occurrence in partially decomposed trachytic tuffs and as these hills according to the view above given consist of trachyte softened and altered in situ the presence of free silica in this case may be added as one more instance to the list concretions in pumiceous tuffthe hill marked in the map crater of an old volcano has no claims to this appellation which i could discover except in being surmounted by a circular very shallow saucerlike summit nearly half a mile in diameter this hollow has been nearly filled up with many successive sheets of ashes and scoriæ of different colours and slightly consolidated each successive saucershaped layer crops out all round the margin forming so many rings of various colours and giving to the hill a fantastic appearance the outer ring is broad and of a white colour hence it resembles a course round which horses have been exercised and has received the name of the devils riding school by which it is most generally known these successive layers of ashes must have fallen over the whole surrounding country but they have all been blown away except in this one hollow in which probably moisture accumulated either during an extraordinary year when rain fell or during the storms often accompanying volcanic eruptions one of the layers of a pinkish colour and chiefly derived from small decomposed fragments of pumice is remarkable from containing numerous concretions these are generally spherical from halfaninch to three inches in diameter but they are occasionally cylindrical like those of ironpyrites in the chalk of europe they consist of a very tough compact palebrown stone with a smooth and even fracture they are divided into concentric layers by thin white partitions resembling the external superficies six or eight of such layers are distinctly defined near the outside but those towards the inside generally become indistinct and blend into a homogeneous mass i presume that these concentric layers were formed by the shrinking of the concretion as it became compact the interior part is generally fissured by minute cracks or septaria which are lined both by black metallic and by other white and crystalline specks the nature of which i was unable to ascertain some of the larger concretions consist of a mere spherical shell filled with slightly consolidated ashes the concretions contain a small proportion of carbonate of lime a fragment placed under the blowpipe decrepitates then whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel but does not become caustic the surrounding ashes do not contain any carbonate of lime hence the concretions have probably been formed as is so often the case by the aggregation of this substance i have not met with any account of similar concretions and considering their great toughness and compactness their occurrence in a bed which probably has been subjected only to atmospheric moisture is remarkable formation of calcareous rocks on the seacoaston several of the seabeaches there are immense accumulations of small wellrounded particles of shells and corals of white yellowish and pink colours interspersed with a few volcanic particles at the depth of a few feet these are found cemented together into stone of which the softer varieties are used for building there are other varieties both coarse and finegrained too hard for this purpose and i saw one mass divided into even layers halfaninch in thickness which were so compact that when struck with a hammer they rang like flint it is believed by the inhabitants that the particles become united in the course of a single year the union is effected by calcareous matter and in the most compact varieties each rounded particle of shell and volcanic rock can be distinctly seen to be enveloped in a husk of pellucid carbonate of lime extremely few perfect shells are embedded in these agglutinated masses and i have examined even a large fragment under a microscope without being able to discover the last vestige of striæ or other marks of external form this shows how long each particle must have been rolled about before its turn came to be embedded and cemented one of the most compact varieties when placed in acid was entirely dissolved with the exception of some flocculent animal matter its specific gravity was the specific gravity of ordinary limestone varies from to pure carrara marble was found by sir h de la beche to be it is remarkable that these rocks of ascension formed close to the surface should be nearly as compact as marble which has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the plutonic regions the great accumulation of loose calcareous particles lying on the beach near the settlement commences in the mouth of october moving towards the sw which as i was informed by lieut evans is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the currents at this period the tidal rocks at the sw end of the beach where the calcareous sand is accumulating and round which the currents sweep become gradually coated with a calcareous incrustation halfaninch in thickness it is quite white compact with some parts slightly spathose and is firmly attached to the rock after a short time it gradually disappears being either redissolved when the water is less charged with lime or more probably is mechanically abraded lieut evans has observed these facts during the six years he has resided at ascension the incrustation varies in thickness in different years in it was unusually thick when i was there in july there was no remnant of the incrustation but on a point of basalt from which the quarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone the incrustation was perfectly preserved considering the position of the tidal rocks and the period at which they become coated there can be no doubt that the movement and disturbance of the vast accumulation of calcareous particles many of them being partially agglutinated together cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with carbonate of lime that they deposit it on the first objects against which they impinge i have been informed by lieut holland rn that this incrustation is formed on many parts of the coast on most of which i believe there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells a frondescent calcareous incrustationin many respects this is a singular deposit it coats throughout the year the tidal volcanic rocks that project from the beaches composed of broken shells its general appearance is well represented in the accompanying woodcut but the fronds or disks of which it is composed are generally so closely crowded together as to touch these fronds have their sinuous edges finely crenulated and they project over their pedestals or supports their upper surfaces are either slightly concave or slightly convex they are highly polished and of a dark gray or jet black colour their form is irregular generally circular and from the tenth of an inch to one inch and ahalf in diameter their thickness or amount of their projection from the rock on which they stand varies much about a quarter of an inch being perhaps most usual the fronds occasionally become more and more convex until they pass into botryoidal masses with their summits fissured when in this state they are glossy and of an intense black so as to resemble some fused metallic substance i have shown the incrustation both in this latter and in its ordinary state to several geologists but not one could conjecture its origin except that perhaps it was of volcanic nature the substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often almost crystalline fracture the edges being translucent and hard enough easily to scratch calcareous spar under the blowpipe it immediately becomes white and emits a strong animal odour like that from fresh shells it is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime when placed in muriatic acid it froths much leaving a residue of sulphate of lime and of an oxide of iron together with a black powder which is not soluble in heated acids this latter substance seems to be carbonaceous and is evidently the colouring matter the sulphate of lime is extraneous and occurs in distinct excessively minute lamellar plates studded on the surfaces of the fronds and embedded between the fine layers of which they are composed when a fragment is heated in the blowpipe these lamellæ are immediately rendered visible the original outline of the fronds may often be traced either to a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock or to several cemented together these first become deeply corroded by the dissolving power of the waves into sharp ridges and then are coated with successive layers of the glossy gray calcareous incrustation the inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every successive layer in the same manner as may often be seen in bezoarstones when an object like a nail forms the centre of aggregation the crenulated edges however of the frond appear to be due to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit alternating with fresh depositions on some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of st jago i found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter which under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and polished fronds of ascension in this case a basis was not afforded by any projecting extraneous particles although the incrustation at ascension is persistent throughout the year yet from the abraded appearance of some parts and from the fresh appearance of other parts the whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation due probably to changes in the form of the shifting beach and consequently in the action of the breakers hence probably it is that the incrustation never acquires a great thickness considering the position of the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach together with its composition i think there can be no doubt that its origin is due to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter composing the rounded particles of shells and corals from this source it derives its animal matter which is evidently the colouring principle the nature of the deposit in its incipient stage can often be well seen upon a fragment of white shell when jammed between two of the fronds it then appears exactly like the thinnest wash of a pale gray varnish its darkness varies a little but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the botryoidal masses seems due to the translucency of the successive gray layers there is however this singular circumstance that when deposited on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures it appears always to be of a pale pearly gray colour even when of considerable thickness hence one is led to suppose that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark colour in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca which are always dark compared with their under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by the mantle of the animal in this circumstancein the immediate loss of colour and in the odour emitted under the blowpipein the degree of hardness and translucency of the edgesand in the beautiful polish of the surface rivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest oliva there is a striking analogy between this inorganic inbeds of gypsum and salt as much as two feet in thickness left by the evaporation of the spray on the rocks on the windward coast beautiful stalactites of selenite resembling in form those of carbonate of lime are formed near these beds amorphous masses of gypsum also occur in caverns in the interior of the island and at cross hill an old crater i saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of scoriæ in these latter cases the salt and gypsum appear to be volcanic products singular laminated beds alternating with and passing into obsidianthese beds occur within the trachytic district at the western base of green mountain under which they dip at a high inclination they are only partially exposed being covered up by modern ejections from this cause i was unable to trace their junction with the trachyte or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava or had been injected amidst the overlying strata there are three principal beds of obsidian of which the thickest forms the base of the section the alternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious and shall be first described and afterwards their passage into the obsidian they have an extremely diversified appearance five principal varieties may be noticed but these insensibly blend into each other by endless gradations firsta pale gray irregularly and coarsely laminated harshfeeling rock resembling clayslate which has been in contact with a trapdike and with a fracture of about the same degree of crystalline structure this rock as well as the following varieties easily fuse into a pale glass the greater part is honeycombed with irregular angular cavities so that the whole has a curious appearance and some fragments resemble in a remarkable manner silicified logs of decayed wood this variety especially where more compact is often marked with thin whitish streaks which are either straight or wrap round one behind the other the elongated carious hollows secondlya bluish gray or pale brown compact heavy homogeneous stone with an angular uneven earthy fracture viewed however under a lens of high power the fracture is seen to be distinctly crystalline and even separate minerals can be distinguished thirdlya stone of the same kind with the last but streaked with numerous parallel slightly tortuous white lines of the thickness of hairs these white lines are more crystalline than the parts between them and the stone splits along them they frequently expand into exceedingly thin cavities which are often only just perceptible with a lens the matter forming the white lines becomes better crystallised in these cavities and prof miller was fortunate enough after several trials to ascertain that the white crystals which are the largest were of quartz and that the minute green transparent needles were augite or as they would more generally be called diopside besides these crystals there are some minute dark specks without a trace of crystallisation and some fine white granular crystalline matter which is probably feldspar minute fragments of this rock are easily fusible fourthlya compact crystalline rock banded in straight lines with innumerable layers of white and gray shades of colour varying in width from the th to the th of an inch these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar and they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar which are placed lengthways they are also thickly studded with microscopically minute amorphous black specks which are placed in rows either standing separately or more frequently united two or three or several together into black lines thinner than a hair when a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe the black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads which become magneticcharacters that apply to no common mineral except hornblende or augite with the black specks there are mingled some others of a red colour which are magnetic before being heated and no doubt are oxide of iron round two little cavities in a specimen of this variety i found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals appearing like those of augite or hornblende but too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer in this specimen also i could distinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar grains which had the aspect of quartz by trying with a parallel ruler i found that the thin gray layers and the black hairlike lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each other it is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous gray rocks to these striped varieties or indeed the character of the different layers in the same specimen without feeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect aggregation of diffused matter into the black and red specks of hornblende and oxide of iron fifthlya compact heavy rock not laminated with an irregular angular highly crystalline fracture it abounds with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar and the crystalline feldspathic base is mottled with a black mineral which on the weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into small crystals some perfect but the greater number imperfect i showed this specimen to an experienced geologist and asked him what it was he answered as i think every one else would have done that it was a primitive greenstone the weathered surface also of the foregoing no banded variety strikingly resembles a worn fragment of finely laminated gneiss these five varieties with many intermediate ones pass and repass into each other as the compact varieties are quite subordinate to the others the whole may be considered as laminated or striped the laminæ to sum up their characteristics are either quite straight or slightly tortuous or convoluted they are all parallel to each other and to the intercalating strata of obsidian they are generally of extreme thinness they consist either of an apparently homogeneous compact rock striped with different shades of gray and brown colours or of crystalline feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of purity and of different thicknesses with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar placed lengthways or of very thin layers chiefly composed of minute crystals of quartz and augite or composed of black and red specks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron either not crystallised or imperfectly so after having fully described the obsidian i shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks of the trachytic series the passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is effected in several ways first angulomodular masses of obsidian both large and small abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty or in an amorphous palecoloured feldspathic rock with a somewhat pearly fracture secondly small irregular nodules of the obsidian either standing separately or united into thin layers seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock which is striped with the finest parallel zones of colour like an agate and which sometimes passes into the nature of pitchstone the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally filled by soft white matter resembling pumiceous ashes thirdly the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into an anguloconcretionary mass of obsidian such masses as well as the small nodules of obsidian are of a pale green colour and are generally streaked with different shades of colour parallel to the laminæ of the surrounding rock they likewise generally contain minute white sphærulites of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one shade of colour and half in a zone of another shade the obsidian assumes its jet black colour and perfectly conchoidal fracture only when in large masses but even in these on careful examination and on holding the specimens in different lights i could generally distinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness one of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several respects a further description it is of a very complicated nature and consists of numerous thin slightly tortuous layers of a palecoloured feldspathic stone often passing into an imperfect pitchstone alternating with layers formed of numberless little globules of two varieties of obsidian and of two kinds of sphærulties embedded in a soft or in a hard pearly base the sphærulites are either white and translucent or dark brown and opaque the former are quite spherical of small size and distinctly radiated from their centre the dark brown sphærulites are less perfectly round and vary in diameter from the th to th of an inch when broken they exhibit towards their centres which are whitish an obscure radiating structure two of them when united sometimes have only one central point of radiation there is occasionally a trace of a hollow or crevice in their centres they stand either separately or are united two or three or many together into irregular groups or more commonly into layers parallel to the stratification of the mass this union in many cases is so perfect that the two sides of the layer thus formed are quite even and these layers as they become less brown and opaque cannot be distinguished from the alternating layers of the palecoloured feldspathic stone the sphaærulites when not united are generally compressed in the plane of the lamination of the mass and in this same plane they are often marked internally by zones of different shades of opaque brown sphærulites drawn on an enlarged scale the upper ones are externally marked with parallel ridges the internal radiating structure of the lower ones is much too plainly represcuted colour and externally by small ridges and furrows in the upper part of the accompanying woodcut the sphærulites with the parallel ridges and furrows are represented on an enlarged scale but they are not well executed and in the lower part their usual manner of grouping is shown in another specimen a thin layer formed of the brown sphærulites closely united together intersects as represented in the woodcut no a layer of similar composition and after running for a short space in a slightly curved line again intersects it and likewise a second layer lying a little way beneath that first intersected the small nodules also of obsidian are sometimes externally marked with ridges and furrows parallel to the lamination of the mass but always less plainly than the sphærulites these obsidian nodules are generally angular with their edges blunted they are often impressed with the form of the adjoining sphærulites than which they are always larger the separate nodules seldom appear to have drawn each other out by exerting a mutual attractive force had i not found in some cases a distinct centre of attraction in these nodules of obsidian i should have been led to have considered them as residuary matter left during the formation of the pearlstone in which they are embedded and of the sphærulitic globules the sphærulites and the little nodules of obsidian in these rocks so closely resemble in general form and structure concretions in sedimentary deposits that one is at once tempted to attribute to them an analogous origin they resemble ordinary concretions in the following respects in their external formin the union of two or three or of several into an irregular mass or into an evensided layerin the occasional intersection of one such layer by another as in the case of chalkflintsin the presence of two or three kinds of nodules often close together in the same basisin their fibrous radiating structure with occasional hollows in their centresin the coexistence of alaminary concretionary and radiating structure as is so well developed in the concretions of magnesian limestone described by professor sedgwick concretions in sedimentary deposits it is known are due to the separation from the surrounding mass of the whole or part of some mineral substance and its aggregation round certain points of attraction guided by this fact i have endeavoured to discover whether obsidian and the sphærulites to which may be added marekanite and pearlstone both of them occurring in nodular concretions in the trachytic series differ in their constituent parts from the minerals generally composing trachytic rocks it appears from three analyses that obsidian contains on an average per cent of silica from one analysis that sphærulites contain from two that marekanite contains and from two other analyses that pearlstone contains of silica now the constituent parts of trachyte as far as they can be distinguished consist of feldspar containing of silica or of albite containing of hornblende containing and of oxide of iron so that the foregoing glassy concretionary substance all contain a larger proportion of silica than that occurring in ordinary feldspathic or trachytic rocks daubuisson also has remarked on the large proportion of silica compared with alumina in six analyses of obsidian and pearlstone given in brongniarts mineralogy hence i conclude that the foregoing concretions have been formed by a process of aggregation strictly analogous to that which takes place in aqueous deposits acting chiefly on the silica but likewise on some of the other elements of the surrounding mass and thus producing the different concretionary varieties from the wellknown effects of rapid cooling in giving glassiness of texture it is probably necessary that the entire mass in cases like that of ascension should have cooled at a certain rate but considering the repeated and complicated alternations of nodules and thin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or crystalline all within the space of a few feet or even inches it is hardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates and thus have acquired their different textures the natural sphærulites in these rocks very closely resemble those produced in glass when slowly cooled in some fine specimens of partially devitrified glass in the possession of mr stokes the sphærulites are united into straight layers with even sides parallel to each other and to one of the outer surfaces exactly as in the obsidian these layers sometimes interbranch and form loops but i did not see any case of actual intersection they form the passage from the perfectly glassy portions to those nearly homogeneous and stony with only an obscure concretionary structure in the same specimen also sphærulites differing slightly in colour and in structure occur embedded close together considering these facts it is some confirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of the obsidian and natural sphærulites to find that m dartigues in his curious paper on this subject attributes the production of sphærulites in glass to the different ingredients obeying their own laws of attraction and becoming aggregated he is led to believe that this takes place from the difficulty in remelting sphærulitic glass without the whole be first thoroughly pounded and mixed together and likewise from the fact that the change takes place most readily in glass composed of many ingredients in confirmation of m dartigues view i may remark that m fleurian de bellevue found that the sphærulitic portions of devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric acid and under the blowpipe in a different manner from the compact paste in which they were embedded comparison of the obsidian beds and alternating strata of ascension with those of other countriesi have been struck with much surprise how closely the excellent description of the obsidian rocks of hungary given by beudant and that by humboldt of the same formation in mexico and peru and likewise the descriptions given by several authors of the trachytic regions in the italian islands agree with my observations at ascension many passages might have been transferred without alteration from the works of the above authors and would have been applicable to this island they all agree in the laminated and stratified character of the whole series and humboldt speaks of some of the beds of obsidian being ribboned like jasper they all agree in the nodular or concretionary character of the obsidian and of the passage of these nodules into layers they all refer to the repeated alternations often in undulatory planes of glassy pearly stony and crystalline layers the crystalline layers however seem to be much more perfectly developed at ascension than in the abovenamed countries humboldt compares some of the stony beds when viewed from a distance to strata of a schistose sandstone sphærulites are described as occurring abundantly in all cases and they everywhere seem to mark the passage from the perfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline beds beudants account of his perlite lithoide globulaire in every even the most trifling particular might have been written for the little brown sphærulitic globules of the rocks of ascension from the close similarity in so many respects between the obsidian formations of hungary mexico peru and of some of the italian islands with that of ascension i can hardly doubt that in all these cases the obsidian and the sphærulites owe their origin to a concretionary aggregation of the silica and of some of the other constituent elements taking place whilst the liquefied mass cooled at a certain required rate it is however well known that in several places obsidian has flowed in streams like lava for instance at teneriffe at the lipari islands and at iceland in these cases the superficial parts are the most perfectly glassy the obsidian passing at the depth of a few feet into an opaque stone in an analysis by vauquelin of a specimen of obsidian from hecla which probably flowed as lava the proportion of silica is nearly the same as in the nodular or concretionary obsidian from mexico it would be interesting to ascertain whether the opaque interior portions and the superficial glassy coating contained the same proportional constituent parts we know from m dufrénoy that the exterior and interior parts of the same stream of lava sometimes differ considerably in their composition even should the whole body of the stream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed with nodular obsidian it would only be necessary in accordance with the foregoing facts to suppose that lava in these instances had been erupted with its ingredients mixed in the same proportion as in the concretionary obsidian lamination of volcanic rocks of the trachytic series we have seen that in several and widely distant countries the strata alternating with beds of obsidian are highly laminated the nodules also both large and small of the obsidian are zoned with different shades of colour and i have seen a specimen from mexico in mr stokes collection with its external surface weathered into ridges and furrows corresponding with the zones of different degrees of glassiness humboldt moreover found on the peak of teneriffe a stream of obsidian divided by very thin alternating layers of pumice many other lavas of the feldspathic series are laminated thus masses of common trachyte at ascension are divided by fine earthy lines along which the rock splits separating thin layers of slightly different shades of colour the greater number also of the embedded crystals of glassy feldspar are placed lengthways in the same direction mr p scrope has described a remarkable columnar trachyte in the panza islands which seems to have been injected into an overlying mass of trachytic conglomerate it is striped with zones often of extreme tenuity of different textures and colours the harder and darker zones appearing to contain a larger proportion of silica in another part of the island there are layers of pearlstone and pitchstone which in many respects resemble those of ascension the zones in the columnar trachyte are generally contorted they extend uninterruptedly for a great length in a vertical direction and apparently parallel to the walls of the dikelike mass von buch has described at teneriffe a stream of lava containing innumerable thin platelike crystals of feldspar which are arranged like white threads one behind the other and which mostly follow the same direction dolimieu also states that the gray lavas of the modern cone of vulcano which have a vitreous texture are streaked with parallel white lines he further describes a solid pumicestone which possesses a fissile structure like that of certain micaceous schists phonolite which i may observe is often if not always an injected rock also often has a fissile structure this is generally due to the parallel position of the embedded crystals of feldspar but sometimes as at fernando noronha seems to be nearly independent of their presence from these facts we see that various rocks of feldspathic series have either a laminated or fissile structure and that it occurs both in masses which have been injected into overlying strata and in others which have flowed as streams of lava the laminæ of the beds alternating with the obsidian at ascension dip at a high angle under the mountain at the base of which they are situated and they do not appear as if they had been inclined by violence a high inclination is common to these beds in mexico peru and in some of the italian islands on the other hand in hungary the layers are horizontal the laminæ also of some of the lavastreams above referred to as far as i can understand the descriptions given of them appear to be highly inclined or vertical i doubt whether in any of these cases the laminæ have been tilted into their present position and in some instances as in that of the trachyte described by mr scrope it is almost certain that they have been originally formed with a high inclination in many of these cases there is evidence that the mass of liquefied rock has moved in the direction of the laminæ at ascension many of the aircells have a drawnout appearance and are crossed by coarse semiglassy fibres in the direction of the laminæ and some of the layers separating the sphærulitic globules have a scored appearance as if produced by the grating of the globules i have seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from mexico in mr stokes collection with the surfaces of the bestdefined layers streaked or furrowed with parallel lines and these lines or streaks precisely resembled those produced on the surface of a mass of artificial glass by its having been poured out of a vessel humboldt also has described little cavities which he compares to the tails of comets behind sphærulites in laminated obsidian rocks from mexico and mr scrope has described other cavities behind fragments embedded in his laminated trachyte and which he supposes to have been produced during the movement of the mass from such facts most authors have attributed the lamination of these volcanic rocks to their movement whilst liquefied although it is easy to perceive why each separate aircell or each fibre in pumicestone should be drawn out in the direction of the moving mass it is by no means at first obvious why such aircells and fibres should be arranged by the movement in the same planes in laminæ absolutely straight and parallel to each other and often of extreme tenuity and still less obvious is it why such layers should come to be of slightly different composition and of different textures in endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of the igneous feldspathic rocks let us return to the facts so minutely described at ascension we there see that some of the thinnest layers are chiefly formed by numerous exceedingly minute though perfect crystals of different minerals that other layers are formed by the union of different kinds of concretionary globules and that the layers thus formed often cannot be distinguished from the ordinary feldspathic and pitchstone layers composing a large portion of the entire mass the fibrous radiating structure of the sphærulites seems judging from many analogous cases to connect the concretionary and crystalline forces the separate crystals also of feldspar all lie in the same parallel planes these allied forces therefore have played an important part in the lamination of the mass but they cannot be considered the primary force for the several kinds of nodules both the smallest and the largest are internally zoned with excessively fine shades of colour parallel to the lamination of the whole and many of them are also externally marked in the same direction with parallel ridges and furrows which have not been produced by weathering some of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers alternating with the obsidian can be distinctly seen to be due to an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals the extent to which the minerals have crystallised can also be distinctly seen to be connected with the greater or less size and with the number of the minute flattened crenulated aircavities or fissures numerous facts as in the case of geodes and of cavities in silicified wood in primary rocks and in veins show that crystallisation is much favoured by space hence i conclude that if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock any cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures or zones of less tension which from the pentup vapours would often be expanded into crenulated aircavities the crystallisation of the constituent parts and probably the formation of concretions would be superinduced or much favoured in such planes and thus a laminated structure of the kind we are here considering would be generated that some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic rocks during their consolidation we must admit in the case of the thin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described by humboldt and of the small flattened crenulated aircells in the laminated rocks of ascension for on no other principle can we conceive why the confined vapours should through their expansion form aircells or fibres in separate parallel planes instead of irregularly throughout the mass in mr stokes collection i have seen a beautiful example of this structure in a specimen of obsidian from mexico which is shaded and zoned like the finest agate with numerous straight parallel layers more or less opaque and white or almost perfectly glassy the degree of opacity and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically minute flattened aircells in this case it is scarcely possible to doubt but that the mass to which the fragment belonged must have been subjected to some probably prolonged action causing the tension slightly to vary in the successive planes several causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension in masses semiliquefied by heat in a fragment of devitrified glass i have observed layers of sphærulites which appeared from the manner in which they were abruptly bent to have been produced by the simple contraction of the mass in the vessel in which it cooled in certain dikes on mount etna described by m elie de beaumont as bordered by alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock one is led to suppose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata which originally produced the fissures continued whilst the injected rock remained fluid guided however by professor forbes clear description of the zoned structure of glacierice far the most probable explanation of the laminated structure of these feldspathic rocks appears to be that they have been stretched whilst slowly flowing onwards in a pasty condition in precisely the same manner as professor forbes believes that the ice of moving glaciers is stretched and fissured in both cases the zones may be compared to those in the finest agates in both they extend in the direction in which the mass has flowed and those exposed on the surface are generally vertical in the ice the porous laminæ are rendered distinct by the subsequent congelation of infiltrated water in the stony feldspathic lavas by subsequent crystalline and concretionary action the fragment of glassy obsidian
