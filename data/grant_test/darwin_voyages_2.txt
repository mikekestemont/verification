ground beneath it was attracted by the extreme elegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosæ the latter in some parts covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high in walking across these thick beds a broad track was marked by the change of shade produced by the drooping of their sensitive petioles it is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder astonishment and devotion which fill and elevate the mind april thleaving socêgo during the two first days we retraced our steps it was very wearisome work as the road generally ran across a glaring hot sandy plain not far from the coast i noticed that each time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand a gentle chirping noise was produced on the third day we took a different line and passed through the gay little village of madre de deos this is one of the principal lines of road in brazil yet it was in so bad a state that no wheel vehicle excepting the clumsy bullockwaggon could pass along in our whole journey we did not cross a single bridge built of stone and those made of logs of wood were frequently so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid them all distances are inaccurately known the road is often marked by crosses in the place of milestones to signify where human blood has been spilled on the evening of the d we arrived at rio having finished our pleasant little excursion during the remainder of my stay at rio i resided in a cottage at botofogo bay it was impossible to wish for any thing more delightful than thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country in england any person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great advantage by always having something to attract his attention but in these fertile climates teeming with life the attractions are so numerous that he is scarcely able to walk at all the few observations which i was enabled to make were almost exclusively confined to the invertebrate animals the existence of a division of the genus planaria which inhabits the dry land interested me much these animals are of so simple a structure that cuvier has arranged them with the intestinal worms though never found within the bodies of other animals numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh water but those to which i allude were found beneath logs of rotten wood even in the drier parts of the forest in general form they resemble little slugs but are very much narrower in proportion i met with one specimen no less than five inches long the lower surface by which they crawl is flat the upper being convex in this latter respect the terrestrial species all differ from the depressed forms of the aquatic their structure is very simple near the middle of the under surface there are two small transverse slits from the anterior one of which a funnelshaped organ or cup can be protruded this seems to act as the mouth it is soft highly irritable and capable of various movements when drawn within the body it is generally folded up like the bud of a plant from the central position of the orifice the animal has its mouth in the middle of what would commonly be called its stomach for some time after the rest of the animal has become dead from the effects of salt water or other cause this organ still retains its vitality the body is soft and parenchymatous in the central part a transparent space with lateral ramifications appears to act as a system of circulation minute black eyelike specks are scattered round the margin of the crawling surface and more abundantly close to the anterior extremity which is constantly used as a feeler in a marine species i extracted from the central parts of the body vast numbers of little spherical eggs they were of an inch in diameter and contained a central opake mass or yolk the terrestrial planariæ of which i have found no less than eight species occur from within the tropic to lat south and are common to south america new zealand van diemens land and mauritius some of the species are longitudinally striped with several bands of gay colours at first sight there is a remarkable false analogy between these animals and snails although so widely separated from each other in all essential points of organization i suppose these planariæ feed on rotten wood for they are always found crawling on the under surface of old decayed trees and some small specimens being kept with no other food rapidly increased in size although gailycoloured little animals they dislike and are very sensitive to the light some specimens which i obtained at van diemens land i kept alive for nearly two months having cut one of them transversely into two nearly equal parts in the course of a fortnight both had the shape of perfect animals i had however so divided the body that one of the halves contained both the inferior orifices and the other in consequence none in the course of twentyfive days from the operation the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from any other specimen the other had increased much in size and towards its posterior end a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass in which a rudimentary cupshaped organ could clearly be distinguished on the under surface however no corresponding slit was yet open if the increased heat of the weather as we approached the equator had not destroyed all the individuals there can be no doubt that this last step would have completed its structure although so wellknown an experiment it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every essential organ out of the simple extremity of another animal it is extremely difficult to preserve these planariæ immediately the cessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act their entire bodies become soft and fluid with a rapidity which i have never seen equalled a method of preservation that i found answered pretty well was to dry the whole animal rapidly on a thin plate of mica for the body thus becomes transparent and allows the internal structure to be seen i first visited the forest in which these planariæ were found in company with an old portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him the sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs and then patiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear we were accompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmera good specimen of a wild brazilian youth he was dressed in a tattered old shirt and trousers and had his head uncovered he carried an oldfashioned gun and a large knife the habit of carrying the knife is universal and in traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary on account of the creeping plants the frequent occurrence of murder may be partly attributed to this habit the brazilians are so dexterous with the knife that they can throw it to some distance with precision and with sufficient force to cause a fatal wound i have seen a number of little boys practising this art as a game of play and from their skill in hitting an upright stick they promised well for more earnest attempts my companion the day before had shot two large bearded monkeys these animals have prehensile tails the extremity of which even after death can support the whole weight of the body one of them thus remained fast to a branch and it was necessary to cut down a large tree to procure it this was soon effected and down came tree and monkey with an awful crash our days sport besides the monkey was confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans i profited however by my acquaintance with the portuguese padre for on another occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the yaguarundi cat every one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near botofogo the house in which i lived was seated close beneath the wellknown mountain of the corcovado it has been remarked with much truth that abruptly conical hills are characteristic of the formation which humboldt designates as gneissgranite nothing can be more striking than the effect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the most luxuriant vegetation i was often interested by watching the clouds which rolling in from seaward formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the corcovado this mountain like most others when thus partly veiled appeared to rise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of feet mr daniell has observed in his meteorological essays that a cloud sometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit while the wind continues to blow over it the same phenomenon here presented a slightly different appearance in this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl over and rapidly pass by the summit and yet was neither diminished nor increased in size the sun was setting and a gentle southerly breeze striking against the southern side of the rock mingled its current with the colder air above and the vapour was thus condensed but as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge and came within the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping bank they were immediately redissolved the climate during the months of may and june or the beginning of winter was delightful the mean temperature from observations taken at nine oclock both morning and evening was only it often rained heavily but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the walks pleasant one morning in the course of six hours inches of rain fell as this storm passed over the forests which surround the corcovado the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless multitude of leaves was very remarkable it could be heard at the distance of a quarter of a mile and was like the rushing of a great body of water after the hotter days it was delicious to sit quietly in the garden and watch the evening pass into night nature in these climes chooses her vocalists from more humble performers than in europe a small frog of the genus hyla sits on a blade of glass about an inch above the surface of the water and sends forth a pleasing chirp when several were together they sung in harmony on different notes various cicadæ and crickets at the same time kept up a ceaseless shrill cry but which softened by the distance was not unpleasant every evening after dark this great concert commenced and often have i sat listening to it until my attention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect at these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to hedge all that i caught belonged to the family of lampyridæ or glowworms and the greater number were lampyris occidentalis i found that this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated in the intervals the abdominal rings were obscured the flash was almost coinstantaneous in the two rings but it was first just perceptible in the anterior one the shining matter was fluid and very adhesive little spots where the skin had been torn continued bright with a slight scintillation whilst the uninjured parts were obscured when the insect was decapitated the rings remained uninterruptedly bright but not so brilliant as before local irritation with a needle always increased the vividness of the light the rings in one instance retained their luminous property nearly twentyfour hours after the death of the insect from these facts it would appear probable that the animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light for short intervals and that at other times the display is involuntary on the muddy and wet gravelwalks i found the larvæ of this lampyris in great numbers they resembled in general form the female of the english glowworm these larvæ possessed but feeble luminous powers very differently from their parents on the slightest touch they feigned death and ceased to shine nor did irritation excite any fresh display i kept several of them alive for some time their tails are very singular organs for they act by a wellfitted contrivance as suckers or organs of attachment and likewise as reservoirs for saliva or some such fluid i repeatedly fed them on raw meat and i invariably observed that every now and then the extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth and a drop of fluid exuded on the meat which was then in the act of being consumed the tail notwithstanding so much practice does not seem to be able to find its way to the mouth at least the neck was always touched first and apparently as a guide when we were at bahia an elater pyrophorus luminosus illig seemed the most common luminous insect the light in this case was also rendered more brilliant by irritation i amused myself one day by observing the springing powers of this insect which have not as it appears to me been properly described the elater when placed on its back and preparing to spring moved its head and thorax backwards so that the pectoral spine was drawn out and rested on the edge of its sheath the same backward movement being continued the spine by the full action of the muscles was bent like a spring and the insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and elytra the effort being suddenly relaxed the head and thorax flew up and in consequence the base of the elytra struck the supporting surface with such force that the insect by the reaction was jerked upwards to the height of one or two inches the projecting points of the thorax and the sheath of the spine served to steady the whole body during the spring in the descriptions which i have read sufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity of the spine so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple muscular contraction without the aid of some mechanical contrivance on several occasions i enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions in the neighbouring country one day i went to the botanic garden where many plants well known for their great utility might be seen growing the leaves of the camphor pepper cinnamon and clove trees were delightfully aromatick and the bread fruit the jack and the mango vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage the landscape in the neighbourhood of bahia almost takes its character from the two latter trees before seeing them i had no idea that any trees could cast so black a shade on the ground both of them bear to the ever green vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which laurels and hollies in england do to the lighter green of the deciduous trees it may be observed that the houses within the tropics are surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation because many of them are at the same time most useful to man who can doubt that these qualities are united in the banana the cocoanut the many kinds of palm the orange and the breadfruit tree during this day i was particularly struck with a remark of humboldts who often alludes to the thin vapour which without changing the transparency of the air renders its tints more harmonious softens its effects c this is an appearance which i have never observed in the temperate zones the atmosphere seen through a short space of half or threequarters of a mile was perfectly lucid but at a greater distance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze of a pale french gray mingled with a little blue the condition of the atmosphere between the morning and about noon when the effect was most evident had undergone little change excepting in its dryness in the interval the difference between the dew point and temperature had increased from to on another occasion i started early and walked to the gavia or topsail mountain the air was delightfully cool and fragrant and the drops of dew still glittered on the leaves of the large liliaceous plants which shaded the streamlets of clear water sitting down on a block of granite it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as they flew past the hummingbirds seem particularly fond of such shady retired spots whenever i saw these little creatures buzzing round a flower with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely visible i was reminded of the sphinx moths their movements and habits are indeed in many respects very similar following a pathway i entered a noble forest and from a height of five or six hundred feet one of those splendid views was presented which are so common on every side of rio at this elevation the landscape has attained its most brilliant tint and every form every shade so completely surpasses in magnificence all that the european has ever beheld in his own country that he knows not how to express his feelings the general effect frequently recalled to my mind the gayest scenery of the operahouse or the great theatres i never returned from these excursions emptyhanded this day i found a specimen of a curious fungus called hymenophallus most people know the english phallus which in autumn taints the air with its odious smell this however as the entomologist is aware is to some of our beetles a delightful fragrance so was it here for a strongylus attracted by the odour alighted on the fungus as i carried it in my hand we here see in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and insects of the same families though the species of both are different when man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species this relation is often broken as one instance of this i may mention that the leaves of the cabbages and lettuces which in england afford food to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars in the gardens near rio are untouched during our stay in brazil i made a large collection of insects a few general observations on the comparative importance of the different orders may be interesting to the english entomologist the large and brilliantlycoloured lepidoptera bespeak the zone they inhabit far more plainly than any other race of animals i allude only to the butterflies for the moths contrary to what might have been expected from the rankness of the vegetation certainly appeared in much fewer numbers than in our own temperate regions i was much surprised at the habits of papilio feronia this butterfly is not uncommon and generally frequents the orangegroves although a high flier yet it very frequently alights on the trunks of trees on these occasions its head is invariably placed downwards and its wings are expanded in a horizontal plane instead of being folded vertically as is commonly the case this is the only butterfly which i have ever seen that uses its legs for running not being aware of this fact the insect more than once as i cautiously approached with my forceps shuffled on one side just as the instrument was on the point of closing and thus escaped but a far more singular fact is the power which this species possesses of making a noise several times when a pair probably male and female were chasing each other in an irregular course they passed within a few yards of me and i distinctly heard a clicking noise similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a spring catch the noise was continued at short intervals and could be distinguished at about twenty yards distance i cannot form a conjecture how it is produced but i am certain there is no error in the observation i was disappointed in the general aspect of the coleoptera the number of minute and obscurelycoloured beetles is exceedingly great the cabinets of europe can as yet boast only of the larger species from tropical climates it is sufficient to disturb the composure of an entomologists mind to look forward to the future dimensions of a complete catalogue the carabidæ appear in extremely few numbers within the tropics this is the more remarkable when compared to the opposed case of the carnivorous mammalia an order which they certainly represent among insects i was struck with this observation both on entering brazil and when i saw the elegant and active forms of the harpalidæ reappearing on the temperate plains of la plata do the very numerous arachnidæ and rapacious hymenoptera supply the place of these carnivorous beetles the carrionfeeders and brachelytra are very uncommon on the other hand the rhyncophora and chrysomelidæ all of which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence are present in astonishing numbers i do not here refer to the number of different species but to that of the individual insects for on this it is that the most striking character in the entomology of different countries depends the orders orthoptera and hemiptera are particularly numerous as likewise is the stinging division of the hymenoptera the bees perhaps being excepted a person on first entering a tropical forest is astonished at the labours of the ants wellbeaten paths branch off in every direction on which an army of neverfailing foragers may be seen some going forth and others returning burdened with pieces of green leaf often larger than their own bodies a small darkcoloured species sometimes migrates in countless numbers one day at bahia my attention was drawn by observing many spiders cockroaches and other insects and some lizards rushing in the greatest agitation across a bare piece of ground a little way behind every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant the swarm having crossed the bare space divided itself and descended an old wall by this means many insects were fairly enclosed and the efforts which the poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death were wonderful when the ants came to the road they changed their course and in narrow files reascended the wall having placed a small stone so as to intercept one of the lines the whole body attacked it and then immediately retired shortly afterwards another body came to the charge and again having failed to make any impression this line of march was entirely given up by going an inch round the file might have avoided the stone and this doubtless would have happened if it had been originally there but having been attacked the lionhearted little warriors scorned the idea of yielding certain wasplike insects which construct in the corners of the verandahs clay cells for their larvæ are very numerous in the neighbourhood of rio these cells they stuff full of dead and dying spiders and caterpillars i was much interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a pepsis and a large spider of the genus lycosa the wasp made a sudden dash at its prey and then flew away the spider was evidently wounded for trying to escape it rolled down a little slope but had still strength sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass the wasp soon returned and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim it then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox making short semicircular casts and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings and antennæ the spider though well concealed was soon discovered and the wasp evidently still afraid of its adversarys jaws after much manœuvring inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax at last carefully examining with its antennæ the now motionless spider it proceeded to drag away the body but i stopped both tyrant and prey the number of spiders in proportion to other insects is here as compared to england very much increased perhaps more so than with any other division of the articulate animals the variety of species among the saltigrade or jumping spiders appears almost infinite the genus or rather family of epeira is here characterized by many singular forms some species have pointed coriaceous shells others enlarged and spiny tibiæ every path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a species belonging to the same division with the epeira clavipes of fabricius which was formerly said by sloane to make in the west indies webs so strong as to catch birds a small and pretty kind of spider with very long anterior legs and which appears to belong to an undescribed genus lives as a parasite on almost every one of these webs i suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great epeira and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects which adhering to the lines would otherwise be wasted when frightened this little spider either feigns death by extending its front legs or suddenly drops from the web a large epeira of the same division with epeira tuberculata and conica with fleshy prominences on its abdomen is extremely common especially in dry situations its web which is generally placed among the great leaves of the common agave is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a pair or even four zigzag ribbons which connect two adjoining rays when any large insect as a grasshopper or wasp is caught the spider by quickly giving it a revolving movement and at the same time emitting a band of threads from its spinners soon envelops its prey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm the spider now examines the powerless victim and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of its thorax then retreating it patiently waits till the poison has taken effect the virulence of this poison may be judged of from the fact that in half a minute i opened the mesh and found a large wasp quite lifeless this epeira always stands with its head downwards near the centre of the web when disturbed it acts differently according to circumstances if there is a thicket below it suddenly falls down i may remark that i have distinctly seen the thread from the spinners lengthened by the will of the animal while yet stationary as preparatory to its fall if the ground is clear beneath the epeira seldom falls but moves quickly through a central passage from one to the other side when still further disturbed it practices a most curious manœuvre standing in the middle it violently jerks the web which is attached to elastic twigs till at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement that even the outline of the spiders body becomes indistinct i will here just mention a gregarious epeira found in great numbers near st fe bajada the capital of one of the provinces of la plata the spiders were of a large size and of a black colour with ruby marks on their backs they were nearly all of one dimension and therefore could not have been a few old individuals with their families the webs were placed vertically as is invariably the case with the genus epeira they were separated from each other by a space of about two feet but were all attached to certain common lines which were of great length and extended to all parts of the community in this manner the tops of some large bushes were encompassed by the united nets azara has described a gregarious spider in paraguay which walckenaer thinks must be a theridion but probably it is an epeira and perhaps even the same species as mine i cannot however recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat in which during autumn when the spiders die azara says the eggs are deposited these gregarious habits in so typical a genus as epeira present a singular case among insects which are so bloodthirsty and solitary that even the sexes attack each other in a lofty valley of the cordillera near mendoza i found another spider with a singularlyformed web strong lines radiated in a vertical plane from a common centre where the insect had its station but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical meshwork so that the net instead of being as is generally the case circular consisted of a wedgeshaped segment all the webs were similarly constructed chapter iii monte video maldonado excursion to r polanco lazo and bolas partridges geology absence of trees cervus campestris river hog tucutuco molothrus cuckoolike habits tyrantflycatcher mockingbird carrion hawks tubes formed by lightning house struck maldonado july th in the morning we got under way and stood out of the splendid harbour of rio de janeiro in our passage to the plata we saw nothing particular excepting on one day a great shoal of porpoises many hundreds in number the whole sea was in places furrowed by them and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented as hundreds proceeding together by jumps in which their whole bodies were exposed thus cut the water when the ship was running nine knots these animals could cross and recross the bows with the greatest ease and then dash away right ahead as soon as we entered the estuary of the plata the weather was very unsettled one dark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and penguins which made such strange noises that the officer on watch reported he could hear the cattle bellowing on shore on a second night we witnessed a splendid scene of natural fireworks the masthead and yardarm ends shone with st elmos light and the form of the vane could almost be traced as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus the sea was so highly luminous that the tracks of the penguins were marked by a fiery wake and lastly the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the most vivid lightning when within the mouth of the river i was interested by observing how slowly the waters of the sea and river mixed the latter muddy and discoloured from its less specific gravity floated on the surface of the salt water this was curiously exhibited in the wake of the vessel where a line of blue was seen mingling in little eddies with the adjoining fluid july thwe anchored at monte video the beagle was employed in surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of america south of the plata during the two succeeding years to prevent useless repetitions i will extract those parts of my journal which refer to the same districts without always attending to the order in which we visited them maldonado is situated on the northern bank of the plata and not very far from the mouth of the estuary it is a most quiet forlorn little town built as is universally the case in these countries with the streets running at right angles to each other and having in the middle a large plaza or square which from its size renders the scantiness of the population more evident and more unsociable it possesses scarcely any trade the exports being confined to a few hides and living cattle the inhabitants are chiefly landowners together with a few shopkeepers and the necessary tradesmen such as blacksmiths and carpenters who do nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round the town is separated from the river by a band of sandhillocks about a mile broad it is surrounded on all other sides by an open slightlyundulating country covered by one uniform layer of fine green turf on which countless herds of cattle sheep and horses graze there is very little land cultivated even close to the town a few hedges made of cacti and agave mark out where some wheat or indian corn has been planted the features of the country are very similar along the whole northern bank of the plata the only difference is that here the granitic hills are rather more boldly pronounced the scenery is very uninteresting there is scarcely a house an enclosed piece of ground or even a tree to give it an air of cheerfulness yet after being imprisoned for some time in a ship there is a charm in the unconfined feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf moreover if your view is limited to a small space many objects possess beauty some of the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured and the bright green sward browsed short by the cattle is ornamented by dwarf flowers among which a plant looking like the daisy claimed the place of an old friend what would a florist say to whole tracts so thickly covered by the verbena melindres as even at a distance to appear of the most gaudy scarlet i staid ten weeks at maldonado in which time a nearly perfect collection of the animals birds and reptiles was procured before making any observations respecting them i will give an account of a little excursion i made as far as the river polanco which is about seventy miles distant in a northerly direction i may mention as a proof how cheap every thing is in this country that i paid only two dollars a day or eight shillings for two men together with a troop of about a dozen ridinghorses my companions were well armed with pistols and sabres a precaution which i thought rather unnecessary but the first piece of news we heard was that the day before a traveller from monte video had been found dead on the road with his throat cut this happened close to a cross the record of a former murder on the first night we slept at a retired little countryhouse and there i soon found out that i possessed two or three articles especially a pocket compass which created unbounded astonishment in every house i was asked to show the compass and by its aid together with a map to point out the direction of various places it excited the liveliest admiration that i a perfect stranger should know the road for direction and road are synonymous in this open country to places where i had never been at one house a young woman who was ill in bed sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass if their surprise was great mine was greater to find such ignorance among people who possessed their thousands of cattle and estancias of great extent it can only be accounted for by the circumstance that this retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners i was asked whether the earth or sun moved whether it was hotter or colder to the north where spain was and many other such questions the greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that england london and north america were different names for the same place but the better informed well knew that london and north america were separate countries close together and that england was a large town in london i carried with me some promethean matches which i ignited by biting it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike fire with his teeth that it was usual to collect the whole family to see it i was once offered a dollar for a single one washing my face in the morning caused much speculation at the village of las minas a superior tradesman closely crossquestioned me about so singular a practice and likewise why on board we wore our beards for he had heard from my guide that we did so he eyed me with much suspicion perhaps he had heard of ablutions in the mahomedan religion and knowing me to be a heretick probably he came to the conclusion that all hereticks were turks it is the general custom in this country to ask for a nights lodging at the first convenient house the astonishment at the compass and my other feats in jugglery was to a certain degree advantageous as with that and the long stories my guides told of my breaking stones knowing venemous from harmless snakes collecting insects c i repaid them for their hospitality i am writing as if i had been among the inhabitants of central africa banda oriental would not be flattered by the comparison but such were my feelings at the time the next day we rode to the village of las minas the country was rather more hilly but otherwise continued the same an inhabitant of the pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly alpine the country is so thinly inhabited that during the whole day we scarcely met a single person las minas is much smaller even than maldonado it is seated on a little plain and is surrounded by low rocky mountains it is of the usual symmetrical form and with its whitewashed church standing in the centre had rather a pretty appearance the outskirting houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings without the accompaniment of gardens or courtyards this is generally the case in the country and all the houses have in consequence an uncomfortable aspect at night we stopped at a pulperia or drinkingshop during the evening a great number of gauchos came in to drink spirits and smoke cigars their appearance is very striking they are generally tall and handsome but with a proud and dissolute expression of countenance they frequently wear their moustaches and long black hair curling down their backs with their brightlycoloured garments great spurs clanking about their heels and knives stuck as daggers and often so used at their waists they look a very different race of men from what might be expected from their name of gauchos or simple countrymen their politeness is excessive they never drink their spirits without expecting you to taste it but whilst making their exceedingly graceful bow they seem quite as ready if occasion offered to cuty our throat on the third day we pursued rather an irregular course as i was employed in examining some beds of marble on the fine plains of turf we saw many ostriches struthio rhea some of the flocks contained as many as twenty or thirty birds these when standing on any little eminence and seen against the clear sky presented a very noble appearance i never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of the country it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them but then expanding their wings they made all sail right before the wind and soon left the horse astern at night we came to the house of don juan fuentes a rich landed proprietor but not personally known to either of my companions on approaching the house of a stranger it is usual to follow several little pieces of etiquette riding up slowly to the door the salutation of ave maria is given and until somebody comes out and asks you to alight it is not customary even to get off your horse having entered the house some general conversation is kept up for a few minutes till permission is asked to pass the night there this is granted as a matter of course the stranger then takes his meals with the family and a room is assigned him where with the horsecloths belonging to his recado or saddle of the pampas he makes his bed it is curious how similar circumstances produce such similar results in manners at the cape of good hope the same hospitality and very nearly the same points of etiquette are universally observed the difference however between the character of the spaniard and that of the dutch boor is shown by the former never asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of politeness whilst the honest dutchman demands where he has been where he is going what is his business and even how many brothers sisters or children he may happen to have shortly after our arrival at don juans one of the large herds of cattle was driven in towards the house and three beasts were picked out to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment these halfwild cattle are very active and knowing full well the fatal lazo they led the horses a long and laborious chase after witnessing the rude wealth displayed in the number of cattle men and horses don juans miserable house was quite curious the floor consisted of hardened mud and the windows were without glass the furniture of the sittingroom boasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools with a couple of tables the supper although several strangers were present consisted of two huge piles one of roast beef the other of boiled with some pieces of pumpkin besides this latter there was no other vegetable and not even a morsel of bread for drinking a large earthenware jug of water served the whole party yet this man was the owner of several square miles of land of which nearly every acre would produce corn and with a little trouble all the common vegetables the evening was spent in smoking with a little impromptu singing accompanied by the guitar the signoritas all sat together in one corner of the room and did not sup with the men so many works have been written about these countries that it is almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas the former consists of a very strong but thin wellplaited rope made of raw hide one end is attached to the broad surcingle which fastens together the complicated gear of the recado or saddle used in the pampas the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass by which a noose can be formed the gaucho when he is going to use the lazo keeps a small coil in his bridle hand and in the other holds the running noose which is made very large generally having a diameter of about eight feet this he whirls round his head and by the dexterous movement of his wrist keeps the noose open then throwing it he causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses the lazo when not used is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado the bolas or balls are of two kinds the simplest which is chiefly used for catching ostriches consists of two round stones covered with leather and united by a thin plaited thong about eight feet long the other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a common centre the gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand and whirls the other two round and round his head then taking aim sends them like chain shot revolving through the air the balls no sooner strike any object than winding round it they cross each other and become firmly hitched the size and weight of the balls varies according to the purpose for which they are made when of stone although not so large as a big apple yet they are sent with such force as sometimes to break the leg even of a horse i have seen the balls made of wood and as large as a turnip for the sake of catching these animals without injuring them the balls are sometimes made of iron and these can be hurled to the greatest distance the main difficulty in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full speed and while suddenly turning about to whirl them so steadily round the head as to take aim on foot any person would soon learn the art one day as i was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head by accident the free one struck a bush and its revolving motion being thus destroyed it immediately fell to the ground and like magic caught one hind leg of my horse the other ball was then jerked out of my hand and the horse fairly secured luckily he was an old practised animal and knew what it meant otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself down the gauchos roared with laughter they cried they had seen every sort of animal caught but had never before seen a man caught by himself during the two succeeding days i reached the furthest point which i was anxious to examine the country wore the same aspect till at last the fine green turf became more wearisome than a dusty turnpike road we every where saw great numbers of partridges tinamus rufescens these birds do not go in coveys nor do they conceal themselves like the english kind it appears a very silly bird a man on horseback by riding round and round in a circle or rather in a spire so as to approach closer each time may knock on the head as many as he pleases the more common method is to catch them with a running noose or little lazo made of the stem of an ostrichs feather fastened to the end of a long stick a boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch thirty or forty in a day the flesh of this bird when cooked is delicately white on our return to maldonado we followed rather a different line of road near pan de azucar a landmark well known to all those who have sailed up the plata i stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable old spaniard early in the morning we ascended the sierra de las animas by the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost picturesque to the westward the view extended over an immense level plain as far as the mount at monte video and to the eastward over the mammillated country of maldonado on the summit of the mountain there were several small heaps of stones which evidently had lain there for many years my companion assured me that they were the work of the indians in the old time the heaps were similar but on a much smaller scale to those so commonly found on the mountains of wales the desire to signalize any event on the highest point of the neighbouring land seems an universal passion with mankind at the present day not a single indian either civilized or wild exists in this part of the province nor am i aware that the former inhabitants have left behind them any more permanent records than these insignificant piles on the summit of the sierra de las animas the geological structure of the country is very simple on the crest of every hill granitic or ancient schistose rocks protrude the intervening spaces being concealed by a great thickness of a red argillaceous earth this at first sight would be mistaken for ordinary detritus but on closer examination it is found to contain small concretionary balls of a friable limestone or marl and to possess other peculiar characters it extends over the whole province and in some places is very remarkable from containing the remains of several great extinct animals this red earthy substance is part of the formation which composes those immense plains of buenos ayres denominated the pampas for its origin we must look to a period when the estuary of the plata occupying far wider limits covered all the surrounding low countries with its brackish waters signs of the gradual elevation of the land can in many places be discovered on the shores of the river and it is probable that the red earthy mass is geologically speaking of no very ancient date the general and almost entire absence of trees in banda oriental is remarkable some of the rocky hills are partly covered by thickets and on the banks of the larger streams especially to the northward of the las minas willowtrees are not uncommon near the arroyo tapes i heard of a wood of palms and one of these trees of considerable size i saw near the pan de azucar in lat these and the trees planted by the spaniards offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of wood among the introduced kinds may be enumerated poplars olives peach and other fruittrees the peaches succeed so well that they afford the main supply of firewood to the city of buenos ayres extremely level countries such as the pampas seldom appear favourable to the growth of trees this may possibly be attributed either to the force of the winds or the kind of drainage in the nature of the land however around maldonado no such reason is apparent the rocky mountains afford protected situations enjoying various kinds of soil streamlets of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley and the clayey nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture it has been inferred with much probability that the presence of woodland is determined by the annual amount of moisture yet in this province abundant and heavy rain falls during the winter and the summer though dry is not so in any excessive degree we see nearly the whole of australia covered by lofty trees yet that country possesses a far more arid climate hence we must look to some other cause the trees of brazil cannot travel so far southward on account of the colder climate nor does there exist any other wooded country whence a migration could take place we are therefore driven to the conclusion that herbaceous plants instead of trees were created to occupy that wide area which within a period not very remote has been raised above the waters of the sea considering south america alone we should be tempted to believe that trees could not possibly flourish excepting in a very humid climate the limit of the forest land certainly follows in a most remarkable manner that of the damp winds in the southern part of the continent where the western gales charged with moisture from the pacific prevail every island on the broken west coast from lat to the extreme point of tierra del fuego is densely covered by impenetrable forest on the eastern side of the cordillera over the same extent of latitude where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere has been drained of its moisture the arid plains of patagonia support a scanty vegetation within the limits of the constant southeast trade wind the bulk of the eastern parts of the continent is ornamented by magnificent forests the west coast however from lat south to lat may be described as a desert in this case as before all the vapour has been condensed by the snow clad pinnacles of the andes in these two areas determined by the prevalent winds the forest and desert lands occupy reversed positions with respect to the great mountain axis between their limits a broad intermediate band which is neither desert nor woodland stretches across the entire continent central chile and the provinces of la plata are included in this division on the west coast about four degrees south of the equator where the trade wind loses its regularity and heavy torrents of rain periodically fall the desert coast of peru assumes near cape blanco the character of luxuriance so celebrated at guayaquil and on the shores of panama after these facts it will perhaps appear a sufficient answer to the question to state that according to the south american type of vegetation the climate of banda oriental is too dry for the growth of trees but this reasoning i apprehend must not be extended to a general statement including other countries the falklands offer a more perplexing case even than maldonado situated under the same latitude with tierra del fuego and only between two and three hundred miles distant from it possessed of an entirely similar climate with a geological formation almost identical with favourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil yet these islands can scarcely boast of a plant deserving the title even of a bush whilst in tierra del fuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the densest forest in this case both the direction of the heavy gales of wind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of seeds canoes and other works of art and trunks of trees drifted from tierra del fuego are frequently thrown on the shores of the western island hence perhaps it is that there are many plants common to the two countries but with respect to trees even some attempts which have been made to transplant them have failed during our stay at maldonado i paid particular attention to the mammalia and birds of the latter i procured within the distance of a mornings walk no less than eighty species of which many were exceedingly beautifuli think even more so than those of brazil the other orders were not neglected reptiles were numerous and nine different kinds of snakes were taken of the indigenous mammalia the only one now left of any size which is common is the cervus campestris this deer is exceedingly abundant throughout the countries bordering the plata it is found in northern patagonia as far south as the rio negro lat but further southward none were seen by the officers employed in surveying the coast it appears to prefer a hilly country i saw very many small herds containing from five to seven animals each near the sierra ventana and among the hills north of maldonado if a person crawling close along the ground slowly advances towards a herd the deer frequently out of curiosity approach to reconnoitre him i have by this means killed from one spot three out of the same herd although so tame and inquisitive yet when approached on horseback they are exceedingly wary in this country nobody goes on foot and the deer knows man as its enemy only when he is mounted and armed with the bolas at bahia blanca a recent establishment in northern patagonia i was surprised to find how little the deer cared for the noise of a gun one day i fired ten times from within eighty yards at one animal and it was much more startled at the ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle my powder being exhausted i was obliged to my shame as a sportsman be it spoken to get up and halloo till the deer ran away the most curious fact with respect to this animal is the overpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck it is quite indescribable several times whilst skinning the specimen which is now mounted at the zoological museum i was almost overcome by nausea i tied up the skin in a silk pockethandkerchief and so carried it home this handkerchief after being well washed i continually used and it was of course as repeatedly washed yet every time for a space of one year and seven months when first unfolded i distinctly perceived the odour this appears an astonishing instance of the permanence of some matter which in its nature nevertheless must be most subtile and volatile frequently when passing at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a herd i have perceived the whole air tainted with the effluvium i believe the smell from the buck is most powerful at the period when its horns are perfect or free from the hairy skin when in this state the meat is of course quite uneatable but the gauchos assert that if buried for some time in fresh earth the taint is removed i have somewhere read that the islanders in the north of scotland treat the rank carcasses of the fisheating birds in the same manner the order rodentia is here very numerous in species of mice alone i obtained no less than eight kinds the largest gnawing animal in the world the hydrochærus capybara the waterhog is here also common one which i shot at monte video weighed ninetyeight pounds its length from the end of the snout to the stumplike tail was three feet two inches and its girth three feet eight these great rodents are generally called carpinchos they occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the plata where the water is quite salt but are far more abundant on the borders of freshwater lakes and rivers near maldonado three or four generally live together in the daytime they either lie among the aquatic plants or openly feed on the turf plain when viewed at a distance from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs but when seated on their haunches and attentively watching any object with one eye they reassume the appearance of their congeners the cavies both the front and side view of their head has quite a ludicrous aspect from the great depth of their jaw these animals at maldonado were very tame by cautiously walking i approached within three yards of four old ones this tameness may probably be accounted for by the jaguar having been banished for some years and by the gaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them as i approached nearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise which is a low abrupt grunt not having much actual sound but rather arising from the sudden expulsion of air the only noise i know at all like it is the first hoarse bark of a large dog having watched the four from almost within arms length and they me for several minutes they rushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity and emitted at the same time their bark after diving a short distance they came again to the surface but only just showed the upper part of their heads when the female is swimming in the water and has young ones they are said to sit on her back these animals are easily killed in numbers but their skins are of trifling value and the meat is very indifferent i have never heard of the carpincho being found south of the plata but as i see in a map that there is a laguna del carpincho high up the rio salado i suppose such must have occurred on the islands in the rio parana they are exceedingly abundant and afford the ordinary prey to the jaguar the tucutuco ctenomys braziliensis is a curious small animal which may be briefly described as a rodent with the habits of a mole it is extremely abundant in some parts of the country but is difficult to be procured and still more difficult to be seen when at liberty it lives almost entirely under ground and prefers a sandy soil with a gentle inclination the burrows are said not to be deep but of great length they are seldom open the earth being thrown up at the mouth into hillocks not quite so large as those made by the mole considerable tracts of country are so completely undermined by
