in mr stokes collection which is zoned with minute aircells must strikingly resemble judging from professor forbes descriptions a fragment of the zoned ice and if the rate of cooling and nature of the mass had been favourable to its crystallisation or to concretionary action we should here have had the finest parallel zones of different composition and texture in glaciers the lines of porous ice and of minute crevices seem to be due to an incipient stretching caused by the central parts of the frozen stream moving faster than the sides and bottom which are retarded by friction hence in glaciers of certain forms and towards the lower end of most glaciers the zones become horizontal may we venture to suppose that in the feldspathic lavas with horizontal laminæ we see an analogous case all geologists who have examined trachytic regions have come to the conclusion that the lavas of this series have possessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity and as it is evident that only matter thus characterised would be subject to become fissured and to be formed into zones of different tensions in the manner here supposed we probably see the reason why augitic lavas which appear generally to have possessed a high degree of fluidity are not like the feldspathic lavas divided into laminæ of different composition and texture moreover in the augitic series there never appears to be any tendency to concretionary action which we have seen plays an important part in the lamination of rocks of the trachytic series or at least in rendering that structure apparent whatever may be thought of the explanation here advanced of the laminated structure of the rocks of the trachytic series i venture to call the attention of geologists to the simple fact that in a body of rock at ascension undoubtedly of volcanic origin layers often of extreme tenuity quite straight and parallel to each other have been producedsome composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside mingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldsparothers entirely composed of these black augitic specks with granules of oxide of ironand lastly others formed of crystalline feldspar in a more or less perfect state of purity together with numerous crystals of feldspar placed lengthways at this island there is reason to believe and in some analogous cases it is certainly known that the laminæ have originally been formed with their present high inclination facts of this nature are manifestly of importance with relation to the structural origin of that grand series of plutonic rocks which like the volcanic have undergone the action of heat and which consists of alternate layers of quartz feldspar mica and other materials chapter iv st helena lavas of the feldspathic basaltic and submarine

calcareous sandstoneextinct landshellsbeds of detrituselevation of the landdenudationcraters of elevation the whole island is of volcanic origin its circumference according to beatson is about twentyeight miles the central and largest part consists of rocks of a feldspathic nature generally decomposed to an extraordinary degree and when in this state presenting a singular assemblage of alternating red purple brown yellow and white soft argillaceous beds from the shortness of our visit i did not examine these beds with care some of them especially those of the white yellow and brown shades originally existed as streams of lava but the greater number were probably ejected in the form of scoriæ and ashes other beds of a purple tint porphyritic with crystalshaped patches of a white soft substance which are now unctuous and yield like wax a polished streak to the nail seem once to have existed as solid claystoneporphyries the red argillaceous beds generally have a brecciated structure and no doubt have been formed by the decomposition of scoriæ several extensive streams however belonging to this series retain their stony character these are either of a blackishgreen colour with minute acicular crystals of feldspar or of a very pale tint and almost composed of minute often scaly crystals of feldspar abounding with microscopical black specks they are generally compact and laminated others however of similar composition are cellular and somewhat decomposed none of these rocks contain large crystals of feldspar or have the harsh fracture peculiar to trachyte these feldspathic lavas and tuffs are the uppermost or those last erupted innumerable dikes however and great masses of molten rock have subsequently been injected into them they converge as they rise towards the central curved ridge of which one point attains the elevation of feet this ridge is the highest land in the island and it once formed the northern rim of a great crater whence the lavas of this series flowed from its ruined condition from the southern half having been removed and from the violent dislocation which the whole island has undergone its structure is rendered very obscure basaltic seriesthe margin of this island is formed by a rude circle of great black stratified ramparts of basalt dipping seaward and worn into cliffs which are often nearly perpendicular and vary in height from a few hundred feet to two thousand this circle or rather horseshoe shaped ring is open to the south and is breached by several other wide spaces its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining inland country and the more recent feldspathic lavas sloping down from the central heights generally abut against and overlap its inner margin on the northwestern side of the island however they appear judging from a distance to have flowed over and concealed portions of it in some parts where the basaltic ring had been breached and the black ramparts stand detached the feldspathic lavas have passed between them and now overhang the seacoast in lofty cliffs the basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified they are generally highly vesicular but occasionally compact some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron others abound with crystals of augite and grains of olivine the vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals of chabasie and even become amygdaloidal with them the streams are separated from each other by cindery matter or by a bright red friable saliferous tuff which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous deposition and sometimes it has an obscure concretionary structure the rocks of this basaltic series occur nowhere except near the coast in most volcanic districts the trachytic lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic but here we see that a great pile of rock closely related in composition to the trachytic family has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata the number however of dikes abounding with large crystals of augite with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected shows perhaps some tendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition basal submarine lavasthe lavas of this basal series lie immediately beneath both the basaltic and feldspathic rocks according to mr seale they may be seen at intervals on the seabeach round the entire island in the sections which i examined their nature varied much some of the strata abound with crystals of augite others are of a brown colour either laminated or in a rubbly condition and many parts are highly amygdaloidal with calcareous matter the successive sheets are either closely united together or are separated from each other by beds of scoriaceous rock and of laminated tuff frequently containing wellrounded fragments the interstices of these beds are filled with gypsum and salt the gypsum also sometimes occurring in thin layers from the large quantity of these two substances from the presence of rounded pebbles in the tuffs and from the abundant amygdaloids i cannot doubt that these basal volcanic strata flowed beneath the sea this remark ought perhaps to be extended to a part of the superincumbent basaltic rocks but on this point i was not able to obtain clear evidence the strata of the basal series whenever i examined them were intersected by an extraordinary number of dikes flagstaff hill and the barni will now describe some of the more remarkable sections and will commence with these two hills which form the principal external feature on the northeastern side of the island the square angular outline and black colour of the barn at once show that it belongs to the basaltic series whilst the smooth conical figure and the varied bright tints of flagstaff hill render it equally clear that it is composed of the softened feldspathic rocks these two lofty hills are connected as is shown in the accompanying woodcut by a sharp ridge which is composed of the rubbly lavas of the basal series the strata of this ridge dip westward the inclination becoming less and less towards the flagstaff and the upper feldspathic strata of this hill can be seen though with some difficulty to dip conformably to the wsw close to the barn the strata of the ridge are nearly vertical but are much obscured by innumerable dikes under this hill they probably change from being vertical into being inclined into an opposite direction for the upper or basaltic strata which are about or feet in thickness are inclined northeastward at an angle between thirty and forty degrees this ridge and likewise the barn and flagstaff hills are interlaced by dikes many of which preserve a remarkable parallelism in a nnw and sse direction the dikes chiefly consist of a rock porphyritic with large crystals of augite others are formed of a finegrained and browncoloured trap most of these dikes are coated by a glossy layer from one to twotenths of an inch in thickness which unlike true pitchstone fuses into a black enamel this layer is evidently analogous to the glossy superficial coating of many lava streams the dikes can often be followed for great lengths both horizontally and vertically and they seem to preserve a nearly uniform thickness mr seale states that one near the barn in a height of feet decreases in width only four inchesfrom nine feet at the bottom to eight feet and eight inches at the top on the ridge the dikes appear to have been guided in their course to a considerable degree by the alternating soft and hard strata they are often firmly united to the harder strata and they preserve their parallelism for such great lengths that in very many instances it was impossible to conjecture which of the beds were dikes and which streams of lava the dikes though so numerous on this ridge are even more numerous in the valleys a little south of it and to a degree i never saw equalled anywhere else in these valleys they extend in less regular lines covering the ground with a network like a spiders web and with some parts of the surface even appearing to consist wholly of dikes interlaced by other dikes from the complexity produced by the dikes from the high inclination and anticlinal dip of the strata of the basal series which are overlaid at the opposite ends of the short ridge by two great masses of different ages and of different composition i am not surprised that this singular section has been misunderstood it has even been supposed to form part of a crater but so far is this from having been the case that the summit of flagstaff hill once formed the lower extremity of a sheet of lava and ashes which were erupted from the central crateriform ridge judging from the slope of the contemporaneous streams in an adjoining and undisturbed part of the island the strata of the flagstaff hill must have been upturned at least twelve hundred feet and probably much more for the great truncated dikes on its summit show that it has been largely denuded the summit of this hill now nearly equals in height the crateriform ridge and before having been denuded it was probably higher than this ridge from which it is separated by a broad and much lower tract of country we here therefore see that the lower extremity of a set of lavastreams have been tilted up to as great a height as or perhaps greater height than the crater down the flanks of which they originally flowed i believe that dislocations on so grand a scale are extremely rare in volcanic districts the formation of such numbers of dikes in this part of the island shows that the surface must here have been stretched to a quite extraordinary degree this stretching on the ridge between flagstaff and barn hills probably took place subsequently though perhaps immediately so to the strata being tilted for had the strata at that time extended horizontally they would in all probability have been fissured and injected transversely instead of in the planes of their stratification although the space between the barn and flagstaff hill presents a distinct anticlinal line extending north and south and though most of the dikes range with much regularity in the same line nevertheless at only a mile due south of the ridge the strata lie undisturbed hence the disturbing force seems to have acted under a point rather than along a line the manner in which it has acted is probably explained by the structure of little stonytop a mountain feet high situated a few miles southward of the barn we there see even from a distance a darkcoloured sharp wedge of compact columnar rock with the brightcoloured feldspathic strata sloping away on each side from its uncovered apex this wedge from which it derives its name of stonytop consists of a body of rock which has been injected whilst liquefied into the overlying strata and if we may suppose that a similar body of rock lies injected beneath the ridge connecting the barn and flagstaff the structure there exhibited would be explained turks cap and prosperous baysprosperous hill is a great black precipitous mountain situated two miles and a half south of the barn and composed like it of basaltic strata these rest in one part on the browncoloured porphyritic beds of the basal series and in another part on a fissured mass of highly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal rock which seems to have formed a small point of eruption beneath the sea contemporaneously with the basal series prosperous hill like the barn is traversed by many dikes of which the greater number range north and south and its strata dip at an angle of about rather obliquely from the island towards the sea the space between prosperous hill and the barn as represented in this woodcut consists of lofty cliffs composed of the lavas of the upper or feldspathic series which rest though unconformably on the basal submarine strata as we have seen that they do at flagstaff hill but differently from what occurs in that hill these upper strata are nearly horizontal gently rising towards the interior of the island they are also composed of greenishblack or more commonly pale brown compact lavas instead of softened and highly coloured matter these browncoloured compact lavas consist almost entirely of small glimmering scales or of minute acicular crystals of feldspar placed close by the side of each other and abounding with minute black specks apparently of hornblende the basaltic strata of prosperous hill project only a little above the level of the gentlysloping feldspathic streams which wind round and abut against their upturned edges the inclination of the basaltic strata seems to be too great to have been caused by their having flowed down a slope and they must have been tilted into their present position before the eruption of the feldspathic streams basaltic ringproceeding round the island the lavas of the upper series southward of prosperous hill overhang the sea in lofty precipices further on the headland called great stonytop is composed as i believe of basalt as is long range point on the inland side of which the coloured beds abut on the southern side of the island we see the basaltic strata of the south barn dipping obliquely seaward at a considerable angle this headland also stands a little above the level of the more modern feldspathic lavas further on a large space of coast on each side of sandy bay has been much denuded and there seems to be left only the basal wreck of the great central crater the basaltic strata reappear with their seaward dip at the foot of the hill called manandhorse and thence they are continued along the whole northwestern coast to sugarloaf hill situated near to the flagstaff and they everywhere have the same seaward inclination and rest in some parts at least on the lavas of the basal series we thus see that the circumference of the island is formed by a muchbroken ring or rather a horseshoe of basalt open to the south and interrupted on the eastern side by many wide breaches the breadth of this marginal fringe on the northwestern side where alone it is at all perfect appears to vary from a mile to a mile and a half the basaltic strata as well as those of the subjacent basal series dip with a moderate inclination where they have not been subsequently disturbed towards the sea the more broken state of the basaltic ring round the eastern half compared with the western half of the island is evidently due to the much greater denuding power of the waves on the eastern or windward side as is shown by the greater height of the cliffs on that side than to leeward whether the margin of basalt was breached before or after the eruption of the lavas of the upper series is doubtful but as separate portions of the basaltic ring appear to have been tilted before that event and from other reasons it is more probable that some at least of the breaches were first formed reconstructing in imagination as far as is possible the ring of basalt the internal space or hollow which has since been filled up with the matter erupted from the great central crater appears to have been of an oval figure eight or nine miles in length by about four miles in breadth and with its axis directed in a ne and sw line coincident with the present longest axis of the island the central curved ridgethis ridge consists as before remarked of gray feldspathic lavas and of red brecciated argillaceous tuffs like the beds of the upper coloured series the gray lavas contain numerous minute black easily fusible specks and but very few large crystals of feldspar they are generally much softened with the exception of this character and of being in many parts highly cellular they are quite similar to those great sheets of lava which overhang the coast at prosperous bay considerable intervals of time appear to have elapsed judging from the marks of denudation between the formation of the successive beds of which this ridge is composed on the steep northern slope i observed in several sections a much worn undulating surface of red tuff covered by gray decomposed feldspathic lavas with only a thin earthy layer interposed between them in an adjoining part i noticed a trapdike four feet wide cut off and covered up by the feldspathic lava as is represented in the woodcut the ridge ends on the eastern side in a hook which is not represented clearly enough in any map which i have seen towards the western end it gradually slopes down and divides into several subordinate ridges the best defined portion between dianas peak and nest lodge which supports the highest pinnacles in the island varying from to feet is rather less than three miles long in a straight line throughout this space the ridge has a uniform appearance and structure its curvature resembles that of the coastline of a great bay being made up of many smaller curves all open to the south the northern and outer side is supported by narrow ridges or buttresses which slope down to the adjoining country the inside is much steeper and is almost precipitous it is formed of the basset edges of the strata which gently decline outwards along some parts of the inner side a little way beneath the summit a flat ledge extends which imitates in outline the smaller curvatures of the crest ledges of this kind occur not unfrequently within volcanic craters and their formation seems to be due to the sinking down of a level sheet of hardened lava the edges of which remain like the ice round a pool from which the water has been drained adhering to the sides in some parts the ridge is surmounted by a wall or parapet perpendicular on both sides near dianas peak this wall is extremely narrow at the galapagos archipelago i observed parapets having a quite similar structure and appearance surmounting several of the craters one which i more particularly examined was composed of glossy red scoriæ firmly connected together being externally perpendicular and extending round nearly the whole circumference of the crater it rendered it almost inaccessible the peak of teneriffe and cotopaxi according to humboldt are similarly constructed he states that at their summits a circular wall surrounds the crater which wall at a distance has the appearance of a small cylinder placed on a truncated cone on cotopaxi this peculiar structure is visible to the naked eye at more than toises distance and no person has ever reached its crater on the peak of teneriffe the parapet is so high that it would be impossible to reach the caldera if on the eastern side there did not exist a breach the origin of these circular parapets is probably due to the heat or vapours from the crater penetrating and hardening the sides to a nearly equal depth and afterwards to the mountain being slowly acted on by the weather which would leave the hardened part projecting in the form of a cylinder or circular parapet from the points of structure in the central ridge now enumeratednamely from the convergence towards it of the beds of the upper seriesfrom the lavas there becoming highly cellularfrom the flat ledge extending along its inner and precipitous side like that within some still active cratersfrom the parapetlike wall on its summitand lastly from its peculiar curvature unlike that of any common line of elevation i cannot doubt that this curved ridge forms the last remnant of a great crater in endeavouring however to trace its former outline one is soon baffled its western extremity gradually slopes down and branching into other ridges extends to the seacoast the eastern end is more curved but it is only a little better defined some appearances lead me to suppose that the southern wall of the crater joined the present ridge near nest lodge in this case the crater must have been nearly three miles long and about a mile and a half in breadth had the denudation of the ridge and the decomposition of its constituent rocks proceeded a few steps farther and had this ridge like several other parts of the island been broken up by great dikes and masses of injected matter we should in vain have endeavoured to discover its true nature even now we have seen that at flagstaff hill the lower extremity and most distant portion of one sheet of the erupted matter has been upheaved to as great a height as the crater down which it flowed and probably even to a greater height it is interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a volcanic district becomes obscured and finally obliterated so near to this last stage is st helena that i believe no one has hitherto suspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is the last wreck of the crater whence the most modern volcanic streams were poured forth the great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved ridge across which the half of the crater must once have extended is formed of bare waterworn hillocks and ridges of red yellow and brown rocks mingled together in chaoslike confusion interlaced by dikes and without any regular stratification the chief part consists of red decomposing scoriæ associated with various kinds of tuff and yellow argillaceous beds full of broken crystals those of augite being particularly large here and there masses of highly cellular and amygdaloidal lavas protrude from one of the ridges in the midst of the valley a conical precipitous hill called lot boldly stands up and forms a most singular and conspicuous object it is composed of phonolite divided in one part into great curved laminæ in another into angular concretionary balls and in a third part into outwardly radiating columns at its base the strata of lava tuff and scoriæ dip away on all sides the uncovered portion is feet in height and its horizonal section gives an oval figure the phonolite is of a greenishgray colour and is full of minute acicular crystals of feldspar in most parts it has a conchoidal fracture and is sonorous yet it is crenulated with minute aircavities in a sw direction from lot there are some other remarkable columnar pinnacles but of a less regular shape namely lots wife and the asses ears composed of allied kinds of rock from their flattened shape and their relative position to each other they are evidently connected on the same line of fissure it is moreover remarkable that this same ne and sw line joining lot and lots wife if prolonged would intersect flagstaff hill which as before stated is crossed by numerous dikes running in this direction and which has a disturbed structure rendering it probable that a great body of once fluid rock lies injected beneath it in this same great valley there are several other conical masses of injected rock one i observed was composed of compact greenstone some of which are not connected as far as is apparent with any line of dike whilst others are obviously thus connected of these dikes three or four great lines stretch across the valley in a ne and sw direction parallel to that one connecting the asses ears lots wife and probably lot the number of these masses of injected rock is a remarkable feature in the geology of st helena besides those just mentioned and the hypothetical one beneath flagstaff hill there is little stonytop and others as i have reason to believe at the manandhorse and at high hill most of these masses if not all of them have been injected subsequently to the last volanic eruptions from the central crater the formation of conical bosses of rock on lines of fissure the walls of which are in most cases parallel may probably be attributed to inequalities in the tension causing small transverse fissures and at these points of intersection the edges of the strata would naturally yield and be easily turned upwards finally i may remark that hills of phonolite everywhere are apt to assume singular and even grotesque shapes like that of lot the peak at fernando noronha offers an instance at st jago however the cones of phonolite though tapering have a regular form supposing as seems probable that all such hillocks or obelisks have originally been injected whilst liquefied into a mould formed by yielding strata as certainly has been the case with lot how are we to account for the frequent abruptness and singularity of their outlines compared with similarly injected masses of greenstone and basalt can it be due to a less perfect degree of fluidity which is generally supposed to be characteristic of the allied trachytic lavas superficial depositssoft calcareous sandstone occurs in extensive though thin superficial beds both on the northern and southern shores of the island it consists of very minute equalsized rounded particles of shells and other organic bodies which partially retain their yellow brown and pink colours and occasionally though very rarely present an obscure trace of their original external forms i in vain endeavoured to find a single unrolled fragment of a shell the colour of the particles is the most obvious character by which their origin can be recognised the tints being affected and an odour produced by a moderate heat in the same manner as in fresh shells the particles are cemented together and are mingled with some earthy matter the purest masses according to beatson contain per cent of carbonate of lime the beds varying in thickness from two or three feet to fifteen feet coat the surface of the ground they generally lie on that side of the valley which is protected from the wind and they occur at the height of several hundred feet above the level of the sea their position is the same which sand if now drifted by the tradewind would occupy and no doubt they thus originated which explains the equal size and minuteness of the particles and likewise the entire absence of whole shells or even of moderatelysized fragments it is remarkable that at the present day there are no shelly beaches on any part of the coast whence calcareous dust could be drifted and winnowed we must therefore look back to a former period when before the land was worn into the present great precipices a shelving coast like that of ascension was favourable to the accumulation of shelly detritus some of the beds of this limestone are between and feet above the sea but part of this height may possibly be due to an elevation of the land subsequent to the accumulation of the calcareous sand the percolation of rainwater has consolidated parts of these beds into a solid rock and has formed masses of dark brown stalagmitic limestone at the sugarloaf quarry fragments of rock on the adjoining slopes have been thickly coated by successive fine layers of calcareous matter it is singular that many of these pebbles have their entire surfaces coated without any point of contact having been left uncovered hence these pebbles must have been lifted up by the slow deposition between them of the successive films of carbonate of lime masses of white finely oolitic rock are attached to the outside of some of these coated pebbles in the earthy detritus on several parts of this hill irregular masses of very impure crystallised sulphate of lime occur as this substance is now being abundantly deposited by the surf at ascension it is possible that these masses may thus have originated but if so it must have been at a period when the land stood at a much lower level this earthy selenite is now found at a height of between and feet von buch has described a compact limestone at lanzarote which seems perfectly to resemble the stalagmitic deposition just mentioned it coats pebbles and in parts is finely oolitic it forms a farextended layer from one inch to two or three feet in thickness and it occurs at the height of feet above the sea but only on that side of the island exposed to the violent northwestern winds von buch remarks that it is not found in hollows but only on the unbroken and inclined surfaces of the mountain he believes that it has been deposited by the spray which is borne over the whole island by these violent winds it appears however to me much more probable that it has been formed as at st helena by the percolation of water through finely comminuted shells for when sand is blown on a much exposed coast it always tends to accumulate on broad even surfaces which offer a uniform resistance to the winds at the neighbouring island moreover of feurteventura there is an earthy limestone which according to von buch is quite similar to specimens which he has seen from st helena and which he believes to have been formed by the drifting of shelly detritus the upper beds of the limestone at the abovementioned quarry on the sugarloaf hill are softer finergrained and less pure than the lower beds they abound with fragments of landshells and with some perfect ones they contain also the bones of birds and the large eggs apparently of waterfowl it is probable that these upper beds remained long in an unconsolidated form during which time these terrestrial productions were embedded mr g r sowerby has kindly examined three species of landshells which i procured from this bed and his descriptions are given in the appendix one of them is a succinea identical with a species now living abundantly on the island the two others namely cochlogena fossilis and helix biplicata are not known in a recent state the latter species was also found in another and different locality associated with a species of cochlogena which is undoubtedly extinct beds of extinct landshellslandshells all of which appear to be species now extinct occur embedded in earth in several parts of the island the greater number have been found at a considerable height on flagstaff hill on the nw side of this hill a rainchannel exposes a section of about twenty feet in thickness of which the upper part consists of black vegetable mould evidently washed down from the heights above and the lower part of less black earth abounding with young and old shells and with their fragments part of this earth is slightly consolidated by calcareous matter apparently due to the partial decomposition of some of the shells mr seale an intelligent resident who first called attention to these shells gave me a large collection from another locality where the shells appear to have been embedded in very black earth mr g r sowerby has examined these shells and has described them in the appendix there are seven species namely one cochlogena two species of the genus cochlicopa and four of helix none of these are known in a recent state or have been found in any other country the smaller species were picked out of the inside of the large shells of the cochlogena aurisvulpina this lastmentioned species is in many respects a very singular one it was classed even by lamarck in a marine genus and having thus been mistaken for a seashell and the smaller accompanying species having been overlooked the exact localities where it was found have been measured and the elevation of this island thus deduced it is very remarkable that all the shells of this species found by me in one spot form a distinct variety as described by mr sowerby from those procured from another locality by mr seale as this cochlogena is a large and conspicuous shell i particularly enquired from several intelligent countrymen whether they had ever seen it alive they all assured me that they had not and they would not even believe that it was a land animal mr seale moreover who was a collector of shells all his life at st helena never met with it alive possibly some of the smaller species may turn out to be yet living kinds but on the other hand the two landshells which are now living on the island in great numbers do not occur embedded as far as it is yet known with the extinct species i have shown in my journal that the extinction of these landshells possibly may not be an ancient event as a great change took place in the state of the island about years ago when the old trees died and were not replaced by young ones these being destroyed by the goats and hogs which had run wild in numbers from the year mr seale states that on flagstaff hill where we have seen that the embedded landshells are especially numerous traces are everywhere discoverable which plainly indicate that it was once thickly clothed with trees at present not even a bush grows there the thick bed of black vegetable mould which covers the shellbed on the flanks of this hill was probably washed down from the upper part as soon as the trees perished and the shelter afforded by them was lost elevation of the landseeing that the lavas of the basal series which are of submarine origin are raised above the level of the sea and at some places to the height of many hundred feet i looked out for superficial signs of the elevation of the land the bottoms of some of the gorges which descend to the coast are filled up to the depth of about a hundred feet by rudely divided layers of sand muddy clay and fragmentary masses in these beds mr seale has found the bones of the tropicbird and of the albatross the former now rarely and the latter never visiting the island from the difference between these layers and the sloping piles of detritus which rest on them i suspect that they were deposited when the gorges stood beneath the sea mr seale moreover has shown that some of the fissurelike gorges become with a concave outline gradually rather wider at the bottom than at the top and this peculiar structure was probably caused by the wearing action of the sea when it entered the lower part of these gorges at greater heights the evidence of the rise of the land is even less clear nevertheless in a baylike depression on the tableland behind prosperous bay at the height of about feet there are flattopped masses of rock which it is scarcely conceivable could have been insulated from the surrounding and similar strata by any other agency than the denuding action of a seabeach much denudation indeed has been effected at great elevations which it would not be easy to explain by any other means thus the flat summit of the barn which is feet high presents according to mr seale a perfect network of truncated dikes on hills like the flagstaff formed of soft rock we might suppose that the dikes had been worn down and cut off by meteoric agency but we can hardly suppose this possible with the hard basaltic strata of the barn coast denudationthe enormous cliffs in many parts between and feet in height with which this prisonlike island is surrounded with the exception of only a few places where narrow valleys descend to the coast is the most striking feature in its scenery we have seen that portions of the basaltic ring two or three miles in length by one or two miles in breadth and from one to two thousand feet in height have been wholly removed there are also ledges and banks of rock rising out of profoundly deep water and distant from the present coast between three and four miles which according to mr seale can be traced to the shore and are found to be the continuations of certain wellknown great dikes the swell of the atlantic ocean has obviously been the active power in forming these cliffs and it is interesting to observe that the lesser though still great height of the cliffs on the leeward and partially protected side of the island extending from the sugarloaf hill to south west point corresponds with the lesser degree of exposure when reflecting on the comparatively low coasts of many volcanic islands which also stand exposed in the open ocean and are apparently of considerable antiquity the mind recoils from an attempt to grasp the number of centuries of exposure necessary to have ground into mud and to have dispersed the enormous cubic mass of hard rock which has been pared off the circumference of this island the contrast in the superficial state of st helena compared with the nearest island namely ascension is very striking at ascension the surfaces of the lavastreams are glossy as if just poured forth their boundaries are well defined and they can often be traced to perfect craters whence they were erupted in the course of many long walks i did not observe a single dike and the coast round nearly the entire circumference is low and has been eaten back though too much stress must not be placed on this fact as the island may have been subsiding into a little wall only from ten to thirty feet high yet during the years since ascension has been known not even the feeblest signs of volcanic action have been recorded on the other hand at st helena the course of no one stream of lava can be traced either by the state of its boundaries or of its superficies the mere wreck of one great crater is left not the valleys only but the surface of some of the highest hills are interlaced by worndown dikes and in many places the denuded summits of great cones of injected rock stand exposed and naked lastly as we have seen the entire circuit of the island has been deeply worn back into the grandest precipices craters of elevation there is much resemblance in structure and in geological history between st helena st jago and mauritius all three islands are bounded at least in the parts which i was able to examine by a ring of basaltic mountains now much broken but evidently once continuous these mountains have or apparently once had their escarpements steep towards the interior of the island and their strata dip outwards i was able to ascertain only in a few cases the inclination of the beds nor was this easy for the stratification was generally obscure except when viewed from a distance i feel however little doubt that according to the researches of m elie de beaumont their average inclination is greater than that which they could have acquired considering their thickness and compactness by flowing down a sloping surface at st helena and at st jago the basaltic strata rest on older and probably submarine beds of different composition at all three islands deluges of more recent lavas have flowed from the centre of the island towards and between the basaltic mountains and at st helena the central platform has been filled up by them all three islands have been raised in mass at mauritius the sea within a late geological period must have reached to the foot of the basaltic mountains as it now does at st helena and at st jago it is cutting back the intermediate plain towards them in these three islands but especially at st jago and at mauritius when standing on the summit of one of the old basaltic mountains one looks in vain towards the centre of the islandthe point towards which the strata beneath ones feet and of the mountains on each side rudely convergefor a source whence these strata could have been erupted but one sees only a vast hollow platform stretched beneath or piles of matter of more recent origin these basaltic mountains come i presume into the class of craters of elevation it is immaterial whether the rings were ever completely formed for the portions which now exist have so uniform a structure that if they do not form fragments of true craters they cannot be classed with ordinary lines of elevation with respect to their origin after having read the works of mr lyell and of mm c prevost and virlet i cannot believe that the great central hollows have been formed by a simple domeshaped elevation and the consequent arching of the strata on the other hand i have very great difficulty in admitting that these basaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments of great volcanos of which the summits have either been blown off or more probably swallowed up by subsidence these rings are in some instances so immense as at st jago and at mauritius and their occurrence is so frequent that i can hardly persuade myself to adopt this explanation moreover i suspect that the following circumstances from their frequent concurrence are someway connected togethera connection not implied in either of the above views namely first the broken state of the ring showing that the now detached portions have been exposed to great denudation and in some cases perhaps rendering it probable that the ring never was entire secondly the great amount of matter erupted from the central area after or during the formation of the ring and thirdly the elevation of the district in mass as far as relates to the inclination of the strata being greater than that which the basal fragments of ordinary volcanos would naturally possess i can readily believe that this inclination might have been slowly acquired by that amount of elevation of which according to m elie de beaumont the numerous upfilled fissures or dikes are the evidence and the measurea view equally novel and important which we owe to the researches of that geologist on mount etna a conjecture including the above circumstances occurred to me whenwith my mind fully convinced from the phenomena of in south america that the forces which eject matter from volcanic orifices and raise continents in mass are identicali viewed that part of the coast of st jago where the horizontally upraised calcareous stratum dips into the sea directly beneath a cone of subsequently erupted lava the conjecture is that during the slow elevation of a volcanic district or island in the centre of which one or more orifices continue open and thus relieve the subterranean forces the borders are elevated more than the central area and that the portions thus upraised do not slope gently into the central less elevated area as does the calcareous stratum under the cone at st jago and as does a large part of the circumference of iceland but that they are separated from it by curved faults we might expect from what we see along ordinary faults that the strata on the upraised side already dipping outwards from their original formation as lavastreams would be tilted from the line of fault and thus have their inclination increased according to this hypothesis which i am tempted to extend only to some few cases it is not probable that the ring would ever be formed quite perfect and from the elevation being slow the upraised portions would generally be exposed to much denudation and hence the ring become broken we might also expect to find occasional inequalities in the dip of the upraised masses as is the case at st jago by this hypothesis the elevation of the districts in mass and the flowing of deluges of lava from the central platforms are likewise connected together on this view the marginal basaltic mountains of the three foregoing islands might still be considered as forming craters of elevation the kind of elevation implied having been slow and the central hollow or platform having been formed not by the arching of the surface but simply by that part having been upraised to a less height which the land is generally low m robert informs me that the inwardly dipping strata appear to extend as far as this line and that their inclination usually corresponds with the slope of the surface from the high coastmountains to the low land at the head of these creeks in the section described by sir g mackenzie the dip is the interior parts of the island chiefly consist as far as is known of recently erupted matter the great size however of iceland equalling the bulkiest part of england ought perhaps to exclude it from the class of islands we have been considering but i cannot avoid suspecting that if the coastmountains instead of gently sloping into the less elevated central area had been separated from it by irregularly curved faults the strata would have been tilted seaward and a crater of elevation like that of st jago or that of mauritius but of much vaster dimensions would have been formed i will only further remark that the frequent occurrence of extensive lakes at the foot of large volcanos and the frequent association of volcanic and freshwater strata seem to indicate that the areas around volcanos are apt to be depressed beneath the general level of the adjoining country either from having been less elevated or from the effects

archipelagoelevation of the landdirection of the fissures of eruption this archipelago is situated under the equator at a distance of between five and six hundred miles from the west coast of south america it consists of five principal islands and of several small ones which together are equal in area but not in extent of land to sicily conjointly with the ionian islands they are all volcanic on two craters have been seen in eruption and on several of the other islands streams of lava have a recent appearance the larger islands are chiefly composed of solid rock and they rise with a tame outline to a height of between one and four thousand feet they are sometimes but not generally surmounted by one principal orifice the craters vary in size from mere spiracles to huge caldrons several miles in circumference they are extraordinarily numerous so that i should think if enumerated they would be found to exceed two thousand they are formed either of scoriæ and lava or of a brown coloured tuff and these latter craters are in several respects remarkable the whole group was surveyed by the officers of the beagle i visited myself four of the principal islands and received specimens from all the others under the head of the different islands i will describe only that which appears to me deserving of attention chatham island craters composed of a singular kind of tufftowards the eastern end of this island there occur two craters composed of two kinds of tuff one kind being friable like slightly consolidated ashes and the other compact and of a different nature from anything which i have met with described this latter substance where it is best characterised is of a yellowishbrown colour translucent and with a lustre somewhat resembling resin it is brittle with an angular rough and very irregular fracture sometimes however being slightly granular and even obscurely crystalline it can readily be scratched with a knife yet some points are hard enough just to mark common glass it fuses with ease into a blackishgreen glass the mass contains numerous broken crystals of olivine and augite and small particles of black and brown scoriæ it is often traversed by thin seams of calcareous matter it generally affects a nodular or concretionary structure in a hand specimen this substance would certainly be mistaken for a pale and peculiar variety of pitchstone but when seen in mass its stratification and the numerous layers of fragments of basalt both angular and rounded at once render its subaqueous origin evident an examination of a series of specimens shows that this resinlike substance results from a chemical change on small particles of pale and darkcoloured scoriaceous rocks and this change could be distinctly traced in different stages round the edges of even the same particle the position near the coast of all the craters composed of this kind of tuff or peperino and their breached condition renders it probable that they were all formed when standing immersed in the sea considering this circumstance together with the remarkable absence of large beds of ashes in the whole archipelago i think it highly probable that much the greater part of the tuff has originated from the trituration of fragments of the gray basaltic lavas in the mouths of craters standing in the sea it may be asked whether the heated water within these craters has produced this singular change in the small scoriaceous particles and given to them their translucent resinlike fracture or has the associated lime played any part in this change i ask these questions from having found at st jago in the cape de verde islands that where a great stream of molten lava has flowed over a calcareous bottom into the sea the outermost film which in other parts resembles pitchstone is changed apparently by its contact with the carbonate of lime into a resinlike substance precisely like the best characterised specimens of the tuff from this archipelago to return to the two craters one of them stands at the distance of a league from the coast the intervening tract consisting of a calcareous tuff apparently of submarine origin this crater consists of a circle of hills some of which stand quite detached but all have a very regular quâquâ versal dip at an inclination of between thirty and forty degrees the lower beds to the thickness of several hundred feet consist of the resinlike stone with embedded fragments of lava the upper beds which are between thirty and forty feet in thickness are composed of a thinly stratified finegrained harsh friable browncoloured tuff or peperino a central mass without any stratification which must formerly have occupied the hollow of the crater but is now attached only to a few of the circumferential hills consists of a tuff intermediate in character between that with a resinlike and that with an earthy fracture this mass contains white calcareous matter in small patches the second crater feet in height must have existed until the eruption of a recent great stream of lava as a separate islet a fine section worn by the sea shows a grand funnelshaped mass of basalt surrounded by steep sloping flanks of tuff having in parts an earthy and in others a semiresinous fracture the tuff is traversed by several broad vertical dikes with smooth and parallel sides which i did not doubt were formed of basalt until i actually broke off fragments these dikes however consist of tuff like that of the surrounding strata but more compact and with a smoother fracture hence we must conclude that fissures were formed and filled up with the finer mud or tuff from the crater before its interior was occupied as it now is by a solidified pool of basalt other fissures have been subsequently formed parallel to these singular dikes and are merely filled with loose rubbish the change from ordinary scoriaceous particles to the substance with a semiresinous fracture could be clearly followed in portions of the compact tuff of these dikes at the distance of a few miles from these two craters stands the kicker rock or islet remarkable from its singular form it is unstratified and is composed of compact tuff in parts having the resinlike fracture it is probable that this amorphous mass like that similar mass in the case first described once filled up the central hollow of a crater and that its flanks or sloping walls have since been worn quite away by the sea in which it stands exposed small basaltic cratersa bare undulating tract at the eastern end of chatham island is remarkable from the number proximity and form of the small basaltic craters with which it is studded they consist either of a mere conical pile or but less commonly of a circle of black and red glossy scoriæ partially cemented together they vary in diameter from to yards and rise from about to feet above the level of the surrounding plain from one small eminence i counted sixty of these craters all of which were within a third of a mile from each other and many were much closer i measured the distance between two very small craters and found that it was only thirty yards from the summitrim of one to the rim of the other small streams of black basaltic lava containing olivine and much glassy feldspar have flowed from many but not from all of these craters the surfaces of the more recent streams were exceedingly rugged and were crossed by great fissures the older streams were only a little less rugged and they were all blended and mingled together in complete confusion the different growth however of the trees on the streams often plainly marked their different ages had it not been for this latter character the streams could in few cases have been distinguished and consequently this wide undulatory tract might have as probably many tracts have been erroneously considered as formed of one great deluge of lava instead of by a multitude of small streams erupted from many small orifices in several parts of this tract and especially at the base of the small craters there are circular pits with perpendicular sides from twenty to forty feet deep at the foot of one small crater there were three of these pits they have probably been formed by the falling in of the roofs of small caverns in other parts there are mammiform hillocks which resemble great bubbles of lava with their summits fissured by irregular cracks which appeared upon entering them to be very deep lava has not flowed from these hillocks there are also other very regular mammiform hillocks composed of stratified lava and surmounted by circular steepsided hollows which i suppose have been formed by a body of gas first arching the strata into one of the bubblelike hillocks and then blowing off its summit these several kinds of hillocks and pits as well as the numerous small scoriaceous craters all show that this tract has been penetrated almost like a sieve by the passage of heated vapours the more regular hillocks could only have been heaved up whilst the lava was in a softened state albemarle islandthis island consists of five great flattopped craters which together with the one on the adjoining island of narborough singularly resemble each other in form and height the southern one is feet high two others are feet a third only feet higher and the remaining ones apparently of nearly the same height three of these are situated on one line and their craters appear elongated in nearly the same direction the northern crater which is not the largest was found by the triangulation to measure externally no less than three miles and oneeighth of a mile in diameter over the lips of these great broad caldrons and from little orifices near their summits deluges of black lava have flowed down their naked sides fluidity of different lavasnear tagus or banks cove i examined one of these great streams of lava which is remarkable from the evidence of its former high degree of fluidity especially when its composition is considered near the seacoast this stream is several miles in width it consists of a black compact base easily fusible into a black bead with angular and not very numerous aircells and thickly studded with large fractured crystals of glassy albite varying from the tenth of an inch to halfaninch in diameter this lava although at first sight appearing eminently porphyritic cannot properly be considered so for the crystals have evidently been enveloped rounded and penetrated by the lava like fragments of foreign rock in a trapdike this was very clear in some specimens of a similar lava from abingdon island in which the only difference was that the vesicles were spherical and more numerous the albite in these lavas is in a similar condition with the leucite of
