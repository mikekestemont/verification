result was that of his seeds floated for days and were then capable of germination but i do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about plants of a flora after having been dried could be floated across a space of sea miles in width and would then germinate the fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small is interesting as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means and alph de candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges but seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner drift timber is thrown up on most islands even on those in the midst of the widest oceans and the natives of the coralislands in the pacific procure stones for their tools solely from the roots of drifted trees these stones being a valuable royal tax i find on examination that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind themso perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about years old three dicotyledonous plants germinated i am certain of the accuracy of this observation again i can show that the carcasses of birds when floating on the sea sometimes escape being immediately devoured and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality peas and vetches for instance are killed by even a few days immersion in seawater but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon which had floated on artificial saltwater for days to my surprise nearly all germinated living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds i could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean we may i think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be miles an hour and some authors have given a far higher estimate i have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird but hard seeds of fruit will pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey in the course of two months i picked up in my garden kinds of seeds out of the excrement of small birds and these seemed perfect and some of them which i tried germinated but the following fact is more important the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice and do not in the least injure as i know by trial the germination of seeds now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for or even hours a bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of miles and hawks are known to look out for tired birds and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered mr brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrierpigeons from france to england as the hawks on the english coast destroyed so many on their arrival some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours disgorge pellets which as i know from experiments made in the zoological gardens include seeds capable of germination some seeds of the oat wheat millet canary hemp clover and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twentyone hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours freshwater fish i find eat seeds of many land and water plants fish are frequently devoured by birds and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place i forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish and then gave their bodies to fishingeagles storks and pelicans these birds after an interval of many hours either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement and several of these seeds retained their power of germination certain seeds however were always killed by this process although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean i can show that earth sometimes adheres to them in one instance i removed twentytwo grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances for many facts could be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds reflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the mediterranean and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute seeds but i shall presently have to recur to this subject as icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones and have even carried brushwood bones and the nest of a landbird i can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions as suggested by lyell and during the glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another in the azores from the large number of the species of plants common to europe in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland and as remarked by mr h c watson from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude i suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by iceborne seeds during the glacial epoch at my request sir c lyell wrote to m hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks which do not occur in the archipelago hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these midocean islands and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants considering that the several above means of transport and that several other means which without doubt remain to be discovered have been in action year after year for centuries and tens of thousands of years it would i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported these means of transport are sometimes called accidental but this is not strictly correct the currents of the sea are not accidental nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind it should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds these means however would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth or from island to island or from a continent to a neighbouring island but not from one distant continent to another the floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be the currents from their course would never bring seeds from north america to britain though they might and do bring seeds from the west indies to our western shores where if not killed by so long an immersion in saltwater they could not endure our climate almost every year one or two landbirds are blown across the whole atlantic ocean from north america to the western shores of ireland and england but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means namely in dirt sticking to their feet which is in itself a rare accident even in this case how small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity but it would be a great error to argue that because a wellstocked island like great britain has not as far as is known and it would be very difficult to prove this received within the last few centuries through occasional means of transport immigrants from europe or any other continent that a poorlystocked island though standing more remote from the mainland would not receive colonists by similar means i do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island even if far less wellstocked than britain scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home as to become naturalised but this as it seems to me is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport during the long lapse of geological time whilst an island was being upheaved and formed and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants on almost bare land with few or no destructive insects or birds living there nearly every seed which chanced to arrive would be sure to germinate and survive dispersal during the glacial periodthe identity of many plants and animals on mountainsummits separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands where the alpine species could not possibly exist is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other it is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the alps or pyrenees and in the extreme northern parts of europe but it is far more remarkable that the plants on the white mountains in the united states of america are all the same with those of labrador and nearly all the same as we hear from asa gray with those on the loftiest mountains of europe even as long ago as such facts led gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at several distinct points and we might have remained in this same belief had not agassiz and others called vivid attention to the glacial period which as we shall immediately see affords a simple explanation of these facts we have evidence of almost every conceivable kind organic and inorganic that within a very recent geological period central europe and north america suffered under an arctic climate the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of scotland and wales with their scored flanks polished surfaces and perched boulders of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled so greatly has the climate of europe changed that in northern italy gigantic moraines left by old glaciers are now clothed by the vine and maize throughout a large part of the united states erratic boulders and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coastice plainly reveal a former cold period the former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of europe as explained with remarkable clearness by edward forbes is substantially as follows but we shall follow the changes more readily by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on and then pass away as formerly occurred as the cold came on and as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and illfitted for their former more temperate inhabitants the latter would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places the inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward unless they were stopped by barriers in which case they would perish the mountains would become covered with snow and ice and their former alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains by the time that the cold had reached its maximum we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora covering the central parts of europe as far south as the alps and pyrenees and even stretching into spain the now temperate regions of the united states would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be nearly the same with those of europe for the present circumpolar inhabitants which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward are remarkably uniform round the world we may suppose that the glacial period came on a little earlier or later in north america than in europe so will the southern migration there have been a little earlier or later but this will make no difference in the final result as the warmth returned the arctic forms would retreat northward closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions and as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground always ascending higher and higher as the warmth increased whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey hence when the warmth had fully returned the same arctic species which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the old and new worlds would be left isolated on distant mountainsummits having been exterminated on all lesser heights and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe we can thus also understand the fact that the alpine plants of each mountainrange are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them for the migration as the cold came on and the remigration on the returning warmth will generally have been due south and north the alpine plants for example of scotland as remarked by mr h c watson and those of the pyrenees as remarked by ramond are more especially allied to the plants of northern scandinavia those of the united states to labrador those of the mountains of siberia to the arctic regions of that country these views grounded as they are on the perfectly wellascertained occurrence of a former glacial period seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the alpine and arctic productions of europe and america that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountainsummits we may almost conclude without other evidence that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts since become too warm for their existence if the climate since the glacial period has ever been in any degree warmer than at present as some geologists in the united states believe to have been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossil gnathodon then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north and subsequently have retreated to their present homes but i have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period since the glacial period the arctic forms during their long southern migration and remigration northward will have been exposed to nearly the same climate and as is especially to be noticed they will have kept in a body together consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed and in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume they will not have been liable to much modification but with our alpine productions left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains the case will have been somewhat different for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other and have survived there ever since they will also in all probability have become mingled with ancient alpine species which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the glacial epoch and which during its coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains they will also have been exposed to somewhat different climatal influences their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed consequently they will have been liable to modification and this we find has been the case for if we compare the present alpine plants and animals of the several great european mountainranges though very many of the species are identically the same some present varieties some are ranked as doubtful forms and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species in illustrating what as i believe actually took place during the glacial period i assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day but the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms but also to many subarctic and to some few northern temperate forms for some of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of north america and europe and it may be reasonably asked how i account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the subarctic and northern temperate forms round the world at the commencement of the glacial period at the present day the subarctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds are separated from each other by the atlantic ocean and by the extreme northern part of the pacific during the glacial period when the inhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards than at present they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature we have good reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period before the glacial epoch and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now the climate was warmer than at the present day hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude º during the pliocene period lived further north under the polar circle in latitude ºº and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole now if we look at a globe we shall see that under the polar circle there is almost continuous land from western europe through siberia to eastern america and to this continuity of the circumpolar land and to the consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate i attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the subarctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds at a period anterior to the glacial epoch believing from reasons before alluded to that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position though subjected to large but partial oscillations of level i am strongly inclined to extend the above view and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period such as the older pliocene period a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land and that these plants and animals both in the old and new worlds began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm long before the commencement of the glacial period we now see as i believe their descendants mostly in a modified condition in the central parts of europe and the united states on this view we can understand the relationship with very little identity between the productions of north america and europea relationship which is most remarkable considering the distance of the two areas and their separation by the atlantic ocean we can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of europe and america during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the old and new worlds will have been almost continuously united by land serving as a bridge since rendered impassable by cold for the intermigration of their inhabitants during the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period as soon as the species in common which inhabited the new and old worlds migrated south of the polar circle they must have been completely cut off from each other this separation as far as the more temperate productions are concerned took place long ages ago and as the plants and animals migrated southward they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native american productions and have had to compete with them and in the other great region with those of the old world consequently we have here everything favourable for much modificationfor far more modification than with the alpine productions left isolated within a much more recent period on the several mountainranges and on the arctic lands of the two worlds hence it has come that when we compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the new and old worlds we find very few identical species though asa gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed but we find in every great class many forms which some naturalists rank as geographical races and others as distinct species and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct as on the land so in the waters of the sea a slow southern migration of a marine fauna which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polar circle will account on the theory of modification for many closely allied forms now living in areas completely sundered thus i think we can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate north america and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans as described in danas admirable work of some fish and other marine animals in the mediterranean and in the seas of japanareas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean these cases of relationship without identity of the inhabitants of seas now disjoined and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the temperate lands of north america and europe are inexplicable on the theory of creation we cannot say that they have been created alike in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas for if we compare for instance certain parts of south america with the southern continents of the old world we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical conditions but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar but we must return to our more immediate subject the glacial period i am convinced that forbess view may be largely extended in europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period from the western shores of britain to the oural range and southward to the pyrenees we may infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation that siberia was similarly affected along the himalaya at points miles apart glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent and in sikkim dr hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines south of the equator we have some direct evidence of former glacial action in new zealand and the same plants found on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story if one account which has been published can be trusted we have direct evidence of glacial action in the southeastern corner of australia looking to america in the northern half iceborne fragments of rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat ºº and on the shores of the pacific where the climate is now so different as far south as lat º erratic boulders have also been noticed on the rocky mountains in the cordillera of equatorial south america glaciers once extended far below their present level in central chile i was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of detritus about feet in height crossing a valley of the andes and this i now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine left far below any existing glacier further south on both sides of the continent from lat º to the southernmost extremity we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action in huge boulders transported far from their parent source we do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these several far distant points on opposite sides of the world but we have good evidence in almost every case that the epoch was included within the latest geological period we have also excellent evidence that it endured for an enormous time as measured by years at each point the cold may have come on or have ceased earlier at one point of the globe than at another but seeing that it endured for long at each and that it was contemporaneous in a geological sense it seems to me probable that it was during a part at least of the period actually simultaneous throughout the world without some distinct evidence to the contrary we may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern and western sides of north america in the cordillera under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones and on both sides of the southern extremity of the continent if this be admitted it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world was at this period simultaneously cooler but it would suffice for my purpose if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of longitude on this view of the whole world or at least of broad longitudinal belts having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole much light can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species in america dr hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of tierra del fuego forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora are common to europe enormously remote as these two points are and there are many closely allied species on the lofty mountains of equatorial america a host of peculiar species belonging to european genera occur on the highest mountains of brazil some few european genera were found by gardner which do not exist in the wide intervening hot countries so on the silla of caraccas the illustrious humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic of the cordillera on the mountains of abyssinia several european forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the cape of good hope occur at the cape of good hope a very few european species believed not to have been introduced by man and on the mountains some few representative european forms are found which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa on the himalaya and on the isolated mountainranges of the peninsula of india on the heights of ceylon and on the volcanic cones of java many plants occur either identically the same or representing each other and at the same time representing plants of europe not found in the intervening hot lowlands a list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe still more striking is the fact that southern australian forms are clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains of borneo some of these australian forms as i hear from dr hooker extend along the heights of the peninsula of malacca and are thinly scattered on the one hand over india and on the other as far north as japan on the southern mountains of australia dr f müller has discovered several european species other species not introduced by man occur on the lowlands and a long list can be given as i am informed by dr hooker of european genera found in australia but not in the intermediate torrid regions in the admirable introduction to the flora of new zealand by dr hooker analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island hence we see that throughout the world the plants growing on the more lofty mountains and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres are sometimes identically the same but they are much oftener specifically distinct though related to each other in a most remarkable manner this brief abstract applies to plants alone some strictly analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals in marine productions similar cases occur as an example i may quote a remark by the highest authority prof dana that it is certainly a wonderful fact that new zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to great britain its antipode than to any other part of the world sir j richardson also speaks of the reappearance on the shores of new zealand tasmania c of northern forms of fish dr hooker informs me that twentyfive species of algæ are common to new zealand and to europe but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas it should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere and on the mountainranges of the intertropical regions are not arctic but belong to the northern temperate zones as mr h c watson has recently remarked in receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes the alpine or mountain floras really become less and less arctic many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful value being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct by others as varieties but some are certainly identical and many though closely related to northern forms must be ranked as distinct species now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts on the belief supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence that the whole world or a large part of it was during the glacial period simultaneously much colder than at present the glacial period as measured by years must have been very long and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries this period will have been ample for any amount of migration as the cold came slowly on all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator followed in the rear by the temperate productions and these by the arctic but with the latter we are not now concerned the tropical plants probably suffered much extinction how much no one can say perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the cape of good hope and in parts of temperate australia as we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature more especially by escaping into the warmest spots but the great fact to bear in mind is that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent on the other hand the temperate productions after migrating nearer to the equator though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions will have suffered less and it is certain that many temperate plants if protected from the inroads of competitors can withstand a much warmer climate than their own hence it seems to me possible bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or even crossed the equator the invasion would of course have been greatly favoured by high land and perhaps by a dry climate for dr falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate on the other hand the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives the mountainranges northwest of the himalaya and the long line of the cordillera seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion and it is a striking fact lately communicated to me by dr hooker that all the flowering plants about fortysix in number common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in north america which must have lain on the line of march but i do not doubt that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the tropics at the period when the cold was most intensewhen arctic forms had migrated some twentyfive degrees of latitude from their native country and covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees at this period of extreme cold i believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet during this the coldest period i suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of the himalaya as graphically described by hooker thus as i believe a considerable number of plants a few terrestrial animals and some marine productions migrated during the glacial period from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical regions and some even crossed the equator as the warmth returned these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains being exterminated on the lowlands those which had not reached the equator would remigrate northward or southward towards their former homes but the forms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during their long southern migration and remigration northward the case may have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains and in the southern hemisphere these being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new forms of life and it is probable that selected modifications in their structure habits and constitutions will have profited them thus many of these wanderers though still plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern hemispheres now exist in their new homes as wellmarked varieties or as distinct species it is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by hooker in regard to america and by alph de candolle in regard to australia that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south than in a reversed direction we see however a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia i suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power than the southern forms and thus when they became commingled during the glacial period the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms just in the same manner as we see at the present day that very many european productions cover the ground in la plata and in a lesser degree in australia and have to a certain extent beaten the natives whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of europe though hides wool and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into europe during the last two or three centuries from la plata and during the last thirty or forty years from australia something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical mountains no doubt before the glacial period they were stocked with endemic alpine forms but these have almost everywhere largely yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north in many islands the native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised and if the natives have not been actually exterminated their numbers have been greatly reduced and this is the first stage towards extinction a mountain is an island on the land and the intertropical mountains before the glacial period must have been completely isolated and i believe that the productions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north just in the same way as the productions of real islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms naturalised by mans agency i am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions very many difficulties remain to be solved i do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means of migration or the reason why certain species and not others have migrated why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms and others have remained unaltered we cannot hope to explain such facts until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by mans agency in a foreign land why one ranges twice or thrice as far and is twice or thrice as common as another species within their own homes i have said that many difficulties remain to be solved some of the most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr hooker in his botanical works on the antarctic regions these cannot be here discussed i will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as kerguelen land new zealand and fuegia i believe that towards the close of the glacial period icebergs as suggested by lyell have been largely concerned in their dispersal but the existence of several quite distinct species belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere is on my theory of descent with modification a far more remarkable case of difficulty for some of these species are so distinct that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the glacial period for their migration and for their subsequent modification to the necessary degree the facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre and i am inclined to look in the southern as in the northern hemisphere to a former and warmer period before the commencement of the glacial period when the antarctic lands now covered with ice supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora i suspect that before this flora was exterminated by the glacial epoch a few forms were widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport and by the aid as haltingplaces of existing and now sunken islands and perhaps at the commencement of the glacial period by icebergs by these means as i believe the southern shores of america australia new zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of vegetable life sir c lyell in a striking passage has speculated in language almost identical with mine on the effects of great alternations of climate on geographical distribution i believe that the world has recently felt one of his great cycles of change and that on this view combined with modification through natural selection a multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained the living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south and to have crossed at the equator but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south as the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines though rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountainsummits in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator the various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man driven up and surviving in the mountainfastnesses of almost every land which serve as a record full of interest to us of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands chapter xii geographical distributioncontinued distribution of freshwater productions on the inhabitants of oceanic islands absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals on the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification summary of the last and present chapters as lakes and riversystems are separated from each other by barriers of land it might have been thought that freshwater productions would not have ranged widely within the same country and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier that they never would have extended to distant countries but the case is exactly the reverse not only have many freshwater species belonging to quite different classes an enormous range but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world i well remember when first collecting in the fresh waters of brazil feeling much surprise at the similarity of the freshwater insects shells c and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings compared with those of britain but this power in freshwater productions of ranging widely though so unexpected can i think in most cases be explained by their having become fitted in a manner highly useful to them for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond or from stream to stream and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence we can here consider only a few cases in regard to fish i believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents but on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously for two riversystems will have some fish in common and some different a few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means like that of the live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water but i am inclined to attribute the dispersal of freshwater fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land having caused rivers to flow into each other instances also could be given of this having occurred during floods without any change of level we have evidence in the loess of the rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period and when the surface was peopled by existing land and freshwater shells the wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountainranges which from an early period must have parted riversystems and completely prevented their inosculation seems to lead to this same conclusion with respect to allied freshwater fish occurring at very distant points of the world no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained but some freshwater fish belong to very ancient forms and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes and consequently time and means for much migration in the second place saltwater fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water and according to valenciennes there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water so that we may imagine that a marine member of a freshwater group might travel far along the shores of the sea and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land some species of freshwater shells have a very wide range and allied species which on my theory are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source prevail throughout the world their distribution at first perplexed me much as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds and they are immediately killed by sea water as are the adults i could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country but two facts which i have observedand no doubt many others remain to be observedthrow some light on this subject when a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duckweed i have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back and it has happened to me in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to another that i have quite unintentionally stocked the one with freshwater shells from the other but another agency is perhaps more effectual i suspended a ducks feet which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond in an aquarium where many ova of freshwater shells were hatching and i found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off these just hatched molluscs though aquatic in their nature survived on the ducks feet in damp air from twelve to twenty hours and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point sir charles lyell also informs me that a dyticus has been caught with an ancylus a freshwater shell like a limpet firmly adhering to it and a waterbeetle of the same family a colymbetes once flew on board the beagle when fortyfive miles distant from the nearest land how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell with respect to plants it has long been known what enormous ranges many freshwater and even marshspecies have both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands this is strikingly shown as remarked by alph de candolle in large groups of terrestrial plants which have only a very few aquatic members for these latter seem immediately to acquire as if in consequence a very wide range i think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact i have before mentioned that earth occasionally though rarely adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds wading birds which frequent the muddy edges of ponds if suddenly flushed would be the most likely to have muddy feet birds of this order i can show are the greatest wanderers and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet when making land they would be sure to fly to their natural freshwater haunts i do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds i have tried several little experiments but will here give only the most striking case i took in february three tablespoonfuls of mud from three different points beneath water on the edge of a little pond this mud when dry weighed only ounces i kept it covered up in my study for six months pulling up and counting each plant as it grew the plants were of many kinds and were altogether in number and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup considering these facts i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if waterbirds did not transport the seeds of freshwater plants to vast distances and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great the same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller freshwater animals other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part i have stated that freshwater fish eat some kinds of seeds though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size as of the yellow waterlily and potamogeton herons and other birds century after century have gone on daily devouring fish they then take flight and go to other waters or are blown across the sea and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination when rejected in pellets or in excrement many hours afterwards when i saw the great size of the seeds of that fine waterlily the nelumbium and remembered alph de candolles remarks on this plant i thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable but audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern waterlily probably according to dr hooker the nelumbium luteum in a herons stomach although i do not know the fact yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the nelumbium undigested or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped in considering these several means of distribution it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed for instance on a rising islet it will be unoccupied and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species however few already occupying any pond yet as the number of kinds is small compared with those on the land the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a place than in the case of terrestrial colonists we should also remember that some perhaps many freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species we should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as freshwater productions ever can range over immense areas and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions but the wide distribution of freshwater plants and of the lower animals whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified i believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals more especially by freshwater birds which have large powers of flight and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water nature like a careful gardener thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature and drops them in another equally well fitted for them on the inhabitants of oceanic islandswe now come to the last of the three classes of facts which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the view that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have descended from a single parent and therefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace notwithstanding that in the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the globe i have already stated that i cannot honestly admit forbess view on continental extensions which if legitimately followed out would lead to the belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to some continent this view would remove many difficulties but it would not i think explain all the facts in regard to insular productions in the following remarks i shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal but shall consider some other facts which bear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification the species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas alph de candolle admits this for plants and wollaston for insects if we look to the large size and varied stations of new zealand extending over miles of latitude and compare its flowering plants only in number with those on an equal area at the cape of good hope or in australia we must i think admit that something quite independently of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in number even the uniform county of cambridge has plants and the little island of anglesea but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair we have evidence that the barren island of ascension aboriginally possessed under halfadozen flowering plants yet many have become naturalised on it as they have on new zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named in st helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions he who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species will have to admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty the proportion of endemic species ie those found nowhere else in the world is often extremely large if we compare for instance the number of the endemic landshells in madeira or of the endemic birds in the galapagos archipelago with the number found on any continent and then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent we shall see that this is true this fact might have been expected on my theory for as already explained species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district and having to compete with new associates will be eminently liable to modification and will often produce groups of modified descendants but it by no means follows that because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar those of another class or of another section of the same class are peculiar and this difference seems to depend on the species which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a body so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed thus in the galapagos islands nearly every landbird but only two out of the eleven marine birds are peculiar and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than landbirds bermuda on the other hand which lies at about the same distance from north america as the galapagos islands do from south america and which has a very peculiar soil does not possess one endemic land bird and we know from mr j m joness admirable account of bermuda that very many north american birds during their great annual migrations visit either periodically or occasionally this island madeira does not possess one peculiar bird and many european and african birds are almost every year blown there as i am informed by mr e v harcourt so that these two islands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds which for long ages have struggled together in their former homes and have become mutually adapted to each other and when settled in their new homes each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits and will consequently have been little liable to modification madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar landshells whereas not one species of seashell is confined to its shores now though we do not know how seashells are dispersed yet we can see that their eggs or larvæ perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber or to the feet of wadingbirds might be transported far more easily than landshells across three or four hundred miles of open sea the different orders of insects in madeira apparently present analogous facts oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes and their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants in the galapagos islands reptiles and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds take the place of mammals in the plants of the galapagos islands dr hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere such cases are generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful facility of immigration i believe has been at least as important as the nature of the conditions many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of remote islands for instance in certain islands not tenanted by mammals some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds this case presents no difficulty on my view for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means and the plant then becoming slightly modified but still retaining its hooked seeds would form an endemic species having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organfor instance as the shrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles again islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species now trees as alph de candolle has shown generally have whatever the cause may be confined ranges hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands and an herbaceous plant though it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature with a fully developed tree when established on an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone might readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants if so natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an island to whatever order they belonged and thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees with respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands bory st vincent long ago remarked that batrachians frogs toads newts have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded i have taken pains to verify this assertion and i have found it strictly true i have however been assured that a frog exists on the mountains
