to the eye from the summitedge of one escarpment to the foot of the next highest one within a distance of miles between santa cruz to port desire where the plains are particularly well developed there are at least seven stages or steps one above the other on the three lower ones namely those of feet feet and feet in height existing littoral shells are abundantly strewed either on the surface or partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth by whatever action these three lower plains have been modelled so undoubtedly have all the higher ones up to a height of feet at s julian and of feet by estimation along st georges bay i think it will not be disputed considering the presence of the upraised marine shells that the sea has been the active power during stages of some kind in the elevatory process we will now briefly consider this subject if we look at the existing coastline the evidence of the great denuding power of the sea is very distinct for from cape st diego in lat to the mouth of the rio negro in lat a length of more than miles the shore is formed with singularly few exceptions of bold and naked cliffs in many places the cliffs are high thus south of the santa cruz they are between and feet in height with their horizontal strata abruptly cut off showing the immense mass of matter which has been removed nearly this whole line of coast consists of a series of greater or lesser curves the horns of which and likewise certain straight projecting portions are formed of hard rocks hence the concave parts are evidently the effect and the measure of the denuding action on the softer strata at the foot of all the cliffs the sea shoals very gradually far outwards and the bottom for a space of some miles everywhere consists of gravel i carefully examined the bed of the sea off the santa cruz and found that its inclination was exactly the same both in amount and in its peculiar curvature with that of the feet plain at the same place if therefore the coast with the bed of the adjoining sea were now suddenly elevated or feet an inland line of cliffs that is an escarpment would be formed with a gravelcapped plain at its foot gently sloping to the sea and having an inclination like that of the existing feet plain from the denuding tendency of the sea this newly formed plain would in time be eaten back into a cliff and repetitions of this elevatory and denuding process would produce a series of gravelcapped sloping terraces rising one above another like those fronting the shores of patagonia the chief difficulty for there are other inconsiderable ones on this view is the factas far as i can trust two continuous lines of soundings carefully taken between santa cruz and the falkland islands and several scattered observations on this and other coaststhat the pebbles at the bottom of the sea quickly and regularly decrease in size with the increasing depth and distance from the shore whereas in the gravel on the sloping plains no such decrease in size was perceptible the following table gives the average result of many soundings off the santa cruz i particularly attended to the size of the pebbles on the feet santa cruz plain and i noticed that on the summitedge of the present seacliffs many were as large as half of a mans head and in crossing from these cliffs to the foot of the next highest escarpment a distance of six miles i could not observe any increase in their size we shall presently see that the theory of a slow and almost insensible rise of the land will explain all the facts connected with the gravelcapped terraces better than the theory of sudden elevations of from one to two hundred feet m dorbigny has argued from the upraised shells at san blas being embedded in the positions in which they lived and from the valves of the azara labiata high on the banks of the parana being united and unrolled that the elevation of northern patagonia and of la plata must have been sudden for he thinks if it had been gradual these shells would all have been rolled on successive beachlines but in protected bays such as in that of bahia blanca wherever the sea is accumulating extensive mudbanks or where the winds quietly heap up sanddunes beds of shells might assuredly be preserved buried in the positions in which they had lived even whilst the land retained the same level any the smallest amount of elevation would directly aid in their preservation i saw a multitude of spots in bahia blanca where this might have been effected and at maldonado it almost certainly has been effected in speaking of the elevation of the land having been slow i do not wish to exclude the small starts which accompany earthquakes as on the coast of chile and by such movements beds of shells might easily be uplifted even in positions exposed to a heavy surf without undergoing any attrition for instance in a rocky flat off the island of santa maria was at one blow upheaved above highwater mark and was left covered with gaping and putrefying musselshells still attached to the bed on which they had lived if m dorbigny had been aware of the many long parallel lines of sandhillocks with infinitely numerous shells of the mactra and venus at a low level near the uruguay if he had seen at bahia blanca the immense sanddunes with waterworn pebbles of pumice ranging in parallel lines one behind the other up a height of at least feet if he had seen the sanddunes with the countless paludestrinas on the low plain near the fort at this place and that long line on the edge of the cliff sixty feet higher up if he had crossed that long and great belt of parallel sanddunes eight miles in width standing at the height of from forty to fifty feet above the colorado where sand could not now collecti cannot believe he would have thought that the elevation of this great district had been sudden certainly the sanddunes especially when abounding with shells which stand in ranges at so many different levels must all have required long time for their accumulation and hence i do not doubt that the last feet of elevation of la plata and northern patagonia has been exceedingly slow if we extend this conclusion to central and southern patagonia the inclination of the successively rising gravelcapped plains can be explained quite as well as by the more obvious view already given of a few comparatively great and sudden elevations in either case we must admit long periods of rest during which the sea ate deeply into the land let us suppose the present coast to rise at a nearly equable slow rate yet sufficiently quick to prevent the waves quite removing each part as soon as brought up in this case every portion of the present bed of the sea will successively form a beachline and from being exposed to a like action will be similarly affected it cannot matter to what height the tides rise even if to forty feet as at santa cruz for they will act with equal force and in like manner on each successive line hence there is no difficulty in the fact of the feet plain at santa cruz sloping up feet to the foot of the next highest escarpment and yet having no marks of any one particular beachline on it for the whole surface on this view has been a beach i cannot pretend to follow out the precise action of the tidal waves during a rise of the land slow yet sufficiently quick to prevent or check denudation but if it be analogous to what takes place on protected parts of the present coast where gravel is now accumulating in large quantities an inclined surface thickly capped by wellrounded pebbles of about the same size would be ultimately left on the gravel now accumulating the waves aided by the wind sometimes throw up a thin covering of sand together with the common coastshells shells thus cast up by gales would during an elevatory period never again be touched by the sea hence on this view of a slow and gradual rising of the land interrupted by periods of rest and denudation we can understand the pebbles being of about the same size over the entire width of the steplike plainsthe occasional thin covering of sandy earthand the presence of broken unrolled fragments of those shells which now live exclusively near the coast summary of resultsit may be concluded that the coast on this side the continent for a space of at least miles has been elevated to a height of feet in la plata and of feet in southern patagonia within the period of existing shells but not of existing mammifers that in la plata the elevation has been very slowly effected that in patagonia the movement may have been by considerable starts but much more probably slow and quiet in either case there have been long intervening periods of comparative rest during which the sea corroded deeply as it is still corroding into the land that the periods of denudation and elevation were contemporaneous and equable over great spaces of coast as shown by the equable heights of the plains that there have been at least eight periods of denudation and that the land up to a height of from to feet has been similarly modelled and affected that the area elevated in the southernmost part of the continent extended in breadth to the cordillera and probably seaward to the falkland islands that northward in la plata the breadth is unknown there having been probably more than one axis of elevation and finally that anterior to the elevation attested by these upraised shells the land was divided by a strait where the river santa cruz now flows and that farther southward there were other seastraits since closed i may add that at santa cruz in lat s the plains have been uplifted at least feet since the period when gigantic boulders were transported between sixty and seventy miles from their parent rock on floating icebergs lastly considering the great upward movements which this long line of coast has undergone and the proximity of its southern half to the volcanic axis of the cordillera it is highly remarkable that in the many fine sections exposed in the pampean patagonian tertiary and boulder formations i nowhere observed the smallest fault or abrupt curvature in the strata gravel formation of patagonia i will here describe in more detail than has been as yet incidentally done the nature origin and extent of the great shingle covering of patagonia but i do not mean to affirm that all of this shingle especially that on the higher plains belongs to the recent period a thin bed of sandy earth with small pebbles of various porphyries and of quartz covering a low plain on the north side of the rio colorado is the extreme northern limit of this formation these little pebbles have probably been derived from the denudation of a more regular bed of gravel capping the old tertiary sandstone plateau of the rio negro the gravelbed near the rio negro is on an average about ten or twelve feet in thickness and the pebbles are larger than on the northern side of the colorado being from one to two inches in diameter and composed chiefly of rather darktinted porphyries amongst them i here first noticed a variety often to be referred to namely a peculiar gallstoneyellow siliceous porphyry frequently but not invariably containing grains of quartz the pebbles are embedded in a white gritty calcareous matrix very like mortar sometimes merely coating with a whitewash the separate stones and sometimes forming the greater part of the mass in one place i saw in the gravel concretionary nodules not rounded of crystallized gypsum some as large as a mans head i traced this bed for fortyfive miles inland and was assured that it extended far into the interior as the surface of the calcareoargillaceous plain of pampean formation on the northern side of the wide valley of the colorado stands at about the same height with the mortarlike cemented gravel capping the sandstone on the southern side it is probable considering the apparent equability of the subterranean movements along this side of america that this gravel of the rio negro and the upper beds of the pampean formation northward of the colorado are of nearly contemporaneous origin and that the calcareous matter has been derived from the same source southward of the rio negro the cliffs along the great bay of s antonio are capped with gravel at san josef i found that the pebbles closely resembled those on the plain of the rio negro but that they were not cemented by calcareous matter between san josef and port desire i was assured by the officers of the survey that the whole face of the country is coated with gravel at port desire and over a space of twentyfive miles inland on the three stepformed plains and in the valleys i everywhere passed over gravel which where thickest was between thirty and forty feet here as in other parts of patagonia the gravel or its sandy covering was as we have seen often strewed with recent marine shells the sandy covering sometimes fills up furrows in the gravel as does the gravel in the underlying tertiary formations the pebbles are frequently whitewashed and even cemented together by a peculiar white friable aluminous fusible substance which i believe is decomposed feldspar at port desire the gravel rested sometimes on the basal formation of porphyry and sometimes on the upper or the lower denuded tertiary strata it is remarkable that most of the porphyritic pebbles differ from those varieties of porphyry which occur here abundantly in situ the peculiar gallstoneyellow variety was common but less numerous than at port s julian where it formed nearly onethird of the mass of gravel the remaining part there consisting of pale gray and greenish porphyries with many crystals of feldspar at port s julian i ascended one of the flattopped hills the denuded remnant of the highest plain and found it at the height of feet capped with the usual bed of gravel near the mouth of the santa cruz the bed of gravel on the feet plain is from twenty to about thirtyfive feet in thickness the pebbles vary from minute ones to the size of a hens egg and even to that of half a mans head they consist of paler varieties of porphyry than those found farther northward and there are fewer of the gallstoneyellow kind pebbles of compact black clayslate were here first observed the gravel as we have seen covers the stepformed plains at the mouth head and on the sides of the great valley of the santa cruz at a distance of miles from the coast the plain has risen to the height of feet above the sea and the gravel with the associated great boulder formation has attained a thickness of feet the plain apparently with its usual gravel covering slopes up to the foot of the cordillera to the height of between and feet in ascending the valley the gravel gradually becomes entirely altered in character high up we have pebbles of crystalline feldspathic rocks compact clayslate quartzose schists and palecoloured porphyries these rocks judging both from the gigantic boulders in the surface and from some small pebbles embedded beneath feet in thickness of the old tertiary strata are the prevailing kinds in this part of the cordillera pebbles of basalt from the neighbouring streams of basaltic lava are also numerous there are few or none of the reddish or of the gallstoneyellow porphyries so common near the coast hence the pebbles on the feet plain at the mouth of the santa cruz cannot have been derived with the exception of those of compact clayslate which however may equally well have come from the south from the cordillera in this latitude but probably in chief part from farther north southward of the santa cruz the gravel may be seen continuously capping the great feet plain at the rio gallegos where this plain is succeeded by a lower one there is as i am informed by captain sulivan an irregular covering of gravel from ten to twelve feet in thickness over the whole country the district on each side of the strait of magellan is covered up either with gravel or the boulder formation it was interesting to observe the marked difference between the perfectly rounded state of the pebbles in the great shingle formation of patagonia and the more or less angular fragments in the boulder formation the pebbles and fragments near the strait of magellan nearly all belong to rocks known to occur in fuegia i was therefore much surprised in dredging south of the strait to find in lat south many pebbles of the gallstoneyellow siliceous porphyry i procured others from a great depth off staten island and others were brought me from the western extremity of the falkland islands the distribution of the pebbles of this peculiar porphyry which i venture to affirm is not found in situ either in fuegia the falkland islands or on the coast of patagonia is very remarkable for they are found over a space of miles in a north and south line and at the falklands miles eastward of the coast of patagonia their occurrence in fuegia and the falklands may however perhaps be due to the same iceagency by which the boulders have been there transported we have seen that porphyritic pebbles of a small size are first met with on the northern side of the rio colorado the bed becoming well developed near the rio negro from this latter point i have every reason to believe that the gravel extends uninterruptedly over the plains and valleys of patagonia for at least nautical miles southward to the rio gallegos from the slope of the plains from the nature of the pebbles from their extension at the rio negro far into the interior and at the santa cruz close up to the cordillera i think it highly probable that the whole breadth of patagonia is thus covered if so the average width of the bed must be about miles near the coast the gravel is generally from ten to thirty feet in thickness and as in the valley of santa cruz it attains at some distance from the cordillera a thickness of feet we may i think safely assume its average thickness over the whole area of by miles at fifty feet the transportal and origin of this vast bed of pebbles is an interesting problem from the manner in which they cap the stepformed plains worn by the sea within the period of existing shells their deposition at least on the plains up to a height of feet must have been a recent geological event from the form of the continent we may feel sure that they have come from the westward probably in chief part from the cordillera but perhaps partly from unknown rocky ridges in the central districts of patagonia that the pebbles have not been transported by rivers from the interior towards the coast we may conclude from the fewness and smallness of the streams of patagonia moreover in the case of the one great and rapid river of santa cruz we have good evidence that its transporting power is very trifling this river is from to yards in width about seventeen feet deep in its middle and runs with a singular degree of uniformity five knots an hour with no lakes and scarcely any still reaches nevertheless to give one instance of its small transporting power upon careful examination pebbles of compact basalt could not be found in the bed of the river at a greater distance than ten miles below the point where the stream rushes over the débris of the great basaltic cliffs forming its shore fragments of the cellular varieties have been washed down twice or thrice as far that the pebbles in central and northern patagonia have not been transported by iceagency as seems to have been the case to a considerable extent farther south and likewise in the northern hemisphere we may conclude from the absence of all angular fragments in the gravel and from the complete contrast in many other respects between the shingle and neighbouring boulder formation looking to the gravel on any one of the stepformed plains i cannot doubt from the several reasons assigned in this chapter that it has been spread out and levelled by the longcontinued action of the sea probably during the slow rise of the land the smooth and perfectly rounded condition of the innumerable pebbles alone would prove longcontinued action but how the whole mass of shingle on the coastplains has been transported from the mountains of the interior is another and more difficult question the following considerations however show that the sea by its ordinary action has considerable power in distributing pebbles a table has already been given showing how very uniformly and gradually the pebbles decrease in size with the gradually seaward increasing depth and distance a series of this kind irresistibly leads to the conclusion that the sea has the power of sifting and distributing the loose matter on its bottom according to martin white the bed of the british channel is disturbed during gales at depths of sixtythree and sixtyseven fathoms and at thirty fathoms shingle and fragments of shells are often deposited afterwards to be carried away again groundswells which are believed to be caused by distant gales seem especially to affect the bottom at such times according to sir r schomburgk the sea to a great distance round the west indian islands at depths from five to fifteen fathoms becomes discoloured and even the anchors of vessels have been moved there are however some difficulties in understanding how the sea can transport pebbles lying at the bottom for from experiments instituted on the power of running water it would appear that the currents of the sea have not sufficient velocity to move stones of even moderate size moreover i have repeatedly found in the most exposed situations that the pebbles which lie at the bottom are encrusted with fullgrown living corallines furnished with the most delicate yet unbroken spines for instance in ten fathoms water off the mouth of the santa cruz many pebbles under half an inch in diameter were thus coated with flustracean zoophytes hence we must conclude that these pebbles are not often violently disturbed it should however be borne in mind that the growth of corallines is rapid the view propounded by prof playfair will i believe explain this apparent difficultynamely that from the undulations of the sea tending to lift up and down pebbles or other loose bodies at the bottom such are liable when thus quite or partially raised to be moved even by a very small force a little onwards we can thus understand how oceanic or tidal currents of no great strength or that recoil movement of the bottomwater near the land called by sailors the undertow which i presume must extend out seaward as far as the breaking waves impel the surfacewater towards the beach may gain the power during storms of sifting and distributing pebbles even of considerable size and yet without so violently disturbing them as to injure the encrusting corallines the sea acts in another and distinct manner in the distribution of pebbles namely by the waves on the beach mr palmer in his excellent memoir on this subject has shown that vast masses of shingle travel with surprising quickness along lines of coast according to the direction with which the waves break on the beach and that this is determined by the prevailing direction of the winds this agency must be powerful in mingling together and disseminating pebbles derived from different sources we may perhaps thus understand the wide distribution of the gallstoneyellow porphyry and likewise perhaps the great difference in the nature of the pebbles at the mouth of the santa cruz from those in the same latitude at the head of the valley i will not pretend to assign to these several and complicated agencies their shares in the distribution of the patagonian shingle but from the several considerations given in this chapter and i may add from the frequency of a capping of gravel on tertiary deposits in all parts of the world as i have myself observed and seen stated in the works of various authors i cannot doubt that the power of widely dispersing gravel is an ordinary contingent on the action of the sea and that even in the case of the great patagonian shinglebed we have no occasion to call in the aid of debacles i at one time imagined that perhaps an immense accumulation of shingle had originally been collected at the foot of the cordillera and that this accumulation when upraised above the level of the sea had been eaten into and partially spread out as off the present line of coast and that the newlyspread out bed had in its turn been upraised eaten into and respread out and so onwards until the shingle which was first accumulated in great thickness at the foot of the cordillera had reached in thinner beds its present extension by whatever means the gravel formation of patagonia may have been distributed the vastness of its area its thickness its superficial position its recent origin and the great degree of similarity in the nature of its pebbles all appear to me well deserving the attention of geologists in relation to the origin of the widelyspread beds of conglomerate belonging to past epochs formation of cliffswhen viewing the seaworn cliffs of patagonia in some parts between and feet in height and formed of horizontal tertiary strata which must once have extended far seawardor again when viewing the lofty cliffs round many volcanic islands in which the gentle inclination of the lavastreams indicates the former extension of the land a difficulty often occurred to me namely how the strata could possibly have been removed by the action of the sea at a considerable depth beneath its surface the following section which represents the general form of the land on the northern and leeward side of st helena taken from mr seals large model and various measurements and of the bottom of the adjoining sea taken chiefly from captain austins survey and some old charts will show the nature of this difficulty if as seems probable the basaltic streams were originally prolonged with nearly their present inclination they must as shown by the dotted line in the section once have extended at least to a point now covered by the sea to a depth of nearly thirty fathoms but i have every reason to believe they extended considerably farther for the inclination of the streams is less near the coast than farther inland it should also be observed that other sections on the coast of this island would have given far more striking results but i had not the exact measurements thus on the windward side the cliffs are about feet in height and the cutoff lava streams very gently inclined and the bottom of the sea has nearly a similar slope all round the island how then has all the hard basaltic rock which once extended beneath the surface of the sea been worn away according to captain austin the bottom is uneven and rocky only to that very small distance from the beach within which the depth is from five to six fathoms outside this line to a depth of about fathoms the bottom is smooth gently inclined and formed of mud and sand outside the fathoms it plunges suddenly into unfathomable depths as is so very commonly the case on all coasts where sediment is accumulating at greater depths than the five or six fathoms it seems impossible under existing circumstances that the sea can both have worn away hard rock in parts to a thickness of at least feet and have deposited a smooth bed of fine sediment now if we had any reason to suppose that st helena had during a long period gone on slowly subsiding every difficulty would be removed for looking at the diagram and imagining a fresh amount of subsidence we can see that the waves would then act on the coastcliffs with fresh and unimpaired vigour whilst the rocky ledge near the beach would be carried down to that depth at which sand and mud would be deposited on its bare and uneven surface after the formation near the shore of a new rocky shoal fresh subsidence would carry it down and allow it to be smoothly covered up but in the case of the many cliffbounded islands for instance in some of the canary islands and of madeira round which the inclination of the strata shows that the land once extended far into the depths of the sea where there is no apparent means of hard rock being worn awayare we to suppose that all these islands have slowly subsided madeira i may remark has according to mr smith of jordanhill subsided are we to extend this conclusion to the high cliffbound horizontallystratified shores of patagonia off which though the water is not deep even at the distance of several miles yet the smooth bottom of pebbles gradually decreasing in size with the increasing depth and derived from a foreign source seem to declare that the sea is now a depositing and not a corroding agent i am much inclined to suspect that we shall hereafter find in all such cases that the land with the adjoining bed of the sea has in truth subsided the time will i believe come when geologists will consider it as improbable that the land should have retained the same level during a whole geological period as that the atmosphere should have remained absolutely calm during an entire season chapter ix on

of gravel abutting to the foot of each other at lowes harbour under a great mass of the boulder formation about feet in thickness i found a layer of sand with numerous comminuted fragments of seashells having a fresh aspect but too small to be identified the island of chiloethe evidence of recent elevation is here more satisfactory the bay of san carlos is in most parts bounded by precipitous cliffs from about ten to forty feet in height their bases being separated from the present line of tidal action by a talus a few feet in height covered with vegetation in one sheltered creek west of p arena instead of a loose talus there was a bare sloping bank of tertiary mudstone perforated above the line of the highest tides by numerous shells of a pholas now common in the harbour the upper extremities of these shells standing upright in their holes with grass growing out of them were abraded about a quarter of an inch to the same level with the surrounding worn strata in other parts i observed as at pudeto a great beach formed of comminuted shells twenty feet above the present shore in other parts again there were small caves worn into the foot of the low cliffs and protected from the waves by the talus with its vegetation one such cave which i examined had its mouth about twenty feet and its bottom which was filled with sand containing fragments of shells and legs of crabs from eight to ten feet above highwater mark from these several facts and from the appearance of the upraised shells i inferred that the elevation had been quite recent and on inquiring from mr williams the portmaster he told me he was convinced that the land had risen or the sea fallen four feet within the last four years during this period there had been one severe earthquake but no particular change of level was then observed from the habits of the people who all keep boats in the protected creeks it is absolutely impossible that a rise of four feet could have taken place suddenly and been unperceived mr williams believes that the change has been quite gradual without the elevatory movement continues at a quick rate there can be no doubt that the sea will soon destroy the talus of earth at the foot of the cliffs round the bay and will then reach its former lateral extension but not of course its former level some of the inhabitants assured me that one such talus with a footpath on it was even already sensibly decreasing in width i received several accounts of beds of shells existing at considerable heights in the inland parts of chiloe and to one of these near catiman i was guided by a countryman here on the south side of the peninsula of lacuy there was an immense bed of the venus costellata and of an oyster lying on the summitedge of a piece of table land feet by the barometer above the level of the sea the shells were closely packed together embedded in and covered by a very black damp peaty mould two or three feet in thickness out of which a forest of great trees was growing considering the nature and dampness of this peaty soil it is surprising that the fine ridges on the outside of the venus are perfectly preserved though all the shells have a blackened appearance i did not doubt that the black soil which when dry cakes hard was entirely of terrestrial origin but on examining it under the microscope i found many very minute rounded fragments of shells amongst which i could distinguish bits of serpulæ and mussels the venus costellata and the ostrea o edulis according to captain king are now the commonest shells in the adjoining bays in a bed of shells a few feet below the feet bed i found a horn of the little cervus humilis which now inhabits chiloe the eastern or inland side of chiloe with its many adjacent islets consists of tertiary and boulder deposits worn into irregular plains capped by gravel near castro and for ten miles southward and on the islet of lemuy i found the surface of the ground to a height of between twenty and thirty feet above highwater mark and in several places apparently up to fifty feet thickly coated by much comminuted shells chiefly of the venus costellata and mytilus chiloensis the species now most abundant on this line of coast as the inhabitants carry immense numbers of these shells inland the continuity of the bed at the same height was often the only means of recognising its natural origin near castro on each side of the creek and rivulet of the gamboa three distinct terraces are seen the lowest was estimated at about feet in height and the highest at about feet with the country irregularly rising behind it obscure traces also of these same terraces could be seen along other parts of the coast there can be no doubt that their three escarpments record pauses in the elevation of the island i may remark that several promontories have the word huapi which signifies in the indian tongue island appended to them such as huapilinao huapilacuy caucahuapi etc and these according to indian traditions once existed as islands in the same manner the term pulo in sumatra is appended to the names of promontories traditionally said to have been islands in sumatra as in chiloe there are upraised recent shells the bay of carelmapu on the mainland north of chiloe according to agüerros was in a good harbour it is now quite useless except for boats valdiviai did not observe here any distinct proofs of recent elevation but in a bed of very soft sandstone forming a fringelike plain about sixty feet in height round the bills of micaslate there are shells of mytilus crepidula solen novaculina and cytheræa too imperfect to be specifically recognised at imperial seventy miles north of valdivia agüerros states that there are large beds of shells at a considerable distance from the coast which are burnt for lime the island of mocha lying a little north of imperial was uplifted two feet during the earthquake of concepcioni cannot add anything to the excellent account by captain fitzroy of the elevation of the land at this place which accompanied the earthquake of i will only recall to the recollection of geologists that the southern end of the island of st mary was uplifted eight feet the central part nine and the northern end ten feet and the whole island more than the surrounding districts great beds of mussels patellæ and chitons still adhering to the rocks were upraised above highwater mark and some acres of a rocky flat which was formerly always covered by the sea was left standing dry and exhaled an offensive smell from the many attached and putrefying shells it appears from the researches of capt fitzroy that both the island of st mary and concepcion which was uplifted only four or five feet in the course of some weeks subsided and lost part of their first elevation i will only add as a lesson of caution that round the sandy shores of the great bay of concepcion it was most difficult owing to the obliterating effects of the great accompanying wave to recognise any distinct evidence of this considerable upheaval one spot must be excepted where there was a detached rock which before the earthquake had always been covered by the sea but afterwards was left uncovered on the island of quiriquina in the bay of concepcion i found at an estimated height of feet extensive layers of shells mostly comminuted but some perfectly preserved and closely packed in black vegetable mould they consisted of concholepas fissurella mytilus trochus and balanus some of these layers of shells rested on a thick bed of brightred dry friable earth capping the surface of the tertiary sandstone and extending as i observed whilst sailing along the coast for miles southward at valparaiso we shall presently see that a similar red earthy mass though quite like terrestrial mould is really in chief part of recent marine origin on the flanks of this island of quiriquina at a less height than the feet there were spaces several feet square thickly strewed with fragments of similar shells during a subsequent visit of the beagle to concepcion mr kent the assistantsurgeon was so kind as to make for me some measurements with the barometer he found many marine remains along the shores of the whole bay at a height of about twenty feet and from the hill of sentinella behind talcahuano at the height of feet he collected numerous shells packed together close beneath the surface in black earth consisting of two species of mytilus two of crepidula one of concholepas of fissurella venus mactra turbo monoceros and the balanus psittacus these shells were bleached and within some of the balani other balani were growing showing that they must have long lain dead in the sea the above species i compared with living ones from the bay and found them identical but having since lost the specimens i cannot give their names this is of little importance as mr broderip has examined a similar collection made during capt beecheys expedition and ascertained that they consisted of ten recent species associated with fragments of echini crabs and flustræ some of these remains were estimated by lieut belcher to lie at the height of nearly a feet above the level of the sea in some places round the bay mr kent observed that there were beds formed exclusively of the mytilus chiloensis this species now lives in parts never uncovered by the tides at considerable heights mr kent found only a few shells but from the summit of one hill feet high he brought me specimens of the concholepas mytilus chiloensis and a turbo these shells were softer and more brittle than those from the height of feet and these latter had obviously a much more ancient appearance than the same species from the height of only twenty feet coast north of concepcionthe first point examined was at the mouth of the rapel miles n of concepcion and sixty miles s of valparaiso where i observed a few shells at the height of feet and some barnacles adhering to the rocks three or four feet above the highest tides m gay found here recent shells at the distance of two leagues from the shore inland there are some wide gravelcapped plains intersected by many broad flatbottomed valleys now carrying insignificant streamlets with their sides cut into successive walllike escarpments rising one above another and in many places according to m gay worn into caves the one cave c del obispo which i examined resembled those formed on many seacoasts with its bottom filled with shingle these inland plains instead of sloping towards the coast are inclined in an opposite direction towards the cordillera like the successively rising terraces on the inland or eastern side of chiloe some points of granite which project through the plains near the coast no doubt once formed a chain of outlying islands on the inland shores of which the plains were accumulated at bucalemu a few miles northward of the rapel i observed at the foot and on the summitedge of a plain ten miles from the coast many recent shells mostly comminuted but some perfect there were also many at the bottom of the great valley of the maypu at san antonio shells are said to be collected and burnt for lime at the bottom of a great ravine quebrada onda on the road to casa blanca at the distance of several miles from the coast i noticed a considerable bed composed exclusively of mesodesma donaciforme desh lying on a bed of muddy sand this shell now lives associated together in great numbers on tidal flats on the coast of chile valparaiso during two successive years i carefully examined part of the time in company with mr alison into all the facts connected with the recent elevation of this neighbourhood in very many parts a beach of broken shells about fourteen or fifteen feet above highwater mark may be observed and at this level the coastrocks where precipitous are corroded in a band at one spot mr alison by removing some birds dung found at this same level barnacles adhering to the rocks for several miles southward of the bay almost every flat little headland between the heights of and feet measured by the barometer is smoothly coated by a thick mass of comminuted shells of the same species and apparently in the same proportional numbers with those existing in the adjoining sea the concholepas is much the most abundant and the best preserved shell but i extracted perfectly preserved specimens of the fissurella biradiata a trochus and balanus both well known but according to mr sowerby yet unnamed and parts of the mytilus chiloensis most of these shells as well as an encrusting nullipora partially retain their colour but they are brittle and often stained red from the underlying brecciated mass of primary rocks some are packed together either in black or reddish mould some lie loose on the bare rocky surfaces the total number of these shells is immense they are less numerous though still far from rare up a height of feet above the sea on the summit of a hill measured feet there was a small horizontal band of comminuted shells of which many consisted and likewise from lesser heights of very young and small specimens of the still living concholepas trochus patellæ crepidulæ and of mytilus magellanicus several of these shells were under a quarter of an inch in their greatest diameter my attention was called to this circumstance by a native fisherman whom i took to look at these shellbeds and he ridiculed the notion of such small shells having been brought up for food nor could some of the species have adhered when alive to other larger shells on another hill some miles distant and feet high i found shells of the concholepas and trochus perfect though very old with fragments of mytilus chiloensis all embedded in reddishbrown mould i also found these same species with fragments of an echinus and of balanus psittacus on a hill feet high above this height shells became very rare though on a hill feet high i collected the concholepas trochus fissurella and a patella at these greater heights the shells are almost invariably embedded in mould and sometimes are exposed only by tearing up bushes these shells obviously had a very much more ancient appearance than those from the lesser heights the apices of the trochi were often worn down the little holes made by burrowing animals were greatly enlarged and the concholepas was often perforated quite through owing to the inner plates of shell having scaled off many of these shells as i have said were packed in and were quite filled with blackish or reddishbrown earth resting on the granitic detritus i did not doubt until lately that this mould was of purely terrestrial origin when with a microscope examining some of it from the inside of a concholepas from the height of about feet i found that it was in considerable part composed of minute fragments of the spines mouthbones and shells of echini and of minute fragments of chiefly very young patellæ mytili and other species i found similar microscopical fragments in earth filling up the central orifices of some large fissurellæ this earth when crushed emits a sickly smell precisely like that from gardenmould mixed with guano the earth accidentally preserved within the shells from the greater heights has the same general appearance but it is a little redder it emits the same smell when rubbed but i was unable to detect with certainty any marine remains in it this earth resembles in general appearance as before remarked that capping the rocks of quiriquina in the bay of concepcion on which beds of seashells lay i have also shown that the black peaty soil in which the shells at the height of feet at chiloe were packed contained many minute fragments of marine animals these facts appear to me interesting as they show that soils which would naturally be considered of purely terrestrial nature may owe their origin in chief part to the sea being well aware from what i have seen at chiloe and in tierra del fuego that vast quantities of shells are carried during successive ages far inland where the inhabitants chiefly subsist on these productions i am bound to state that at greater heights than feet where the number of very young and small shells proved that they had not been carried up for food the only evidence of the shells having been naturally left by the sea consists in their invariable and uniform appearance of extreme antiquityin the distance of some of the places from the coast in others being inaccessible from the nearest part of the beach and in the absence of fresh water for men to drinkin the shells not lying in heapsand lastly in the close similarity of the soil in which they are embedded to that which lower down can be unequivocally shown to be in great part formed from the débris of the sea animals with respect to the position in which the shells lie i was repeatedly struck here at concepcion and at other places with the frequency of their occurrence on the summits and edges either of separate hills or of little flat headlands often terminating precipitously over the sea the several aboveenumerated species of mollusca which are found strewed on the surface of the land from a few feet above the level of the sea up to the height of feet all now live either on the beach or at only a few fathoms depth mr edmonston in a letter to prof e forbes states that in dredging in the bay of valparaiso he found the common species of concholepas fissurella trochus monoceros chitons c living in abundance from the beach to a depth of seven fathoms and dead shells occurred only a few fathoms deeper the common turritella cingulata was dredged up living at even from ten to fifteen fathoms but this is a species which i did not find here amongst the upraised shells considering this fact of the species being all littoral or sublittoral considering their occurrence at various heights their vast numbers and their generally comminuted state there can be little doubt that they were left on successive beachlines during a gradual elevation of the land the presence however of so many whole and perfectly preserved shells appears at first a difficulty on this view considering that the coast is exposed to the full force of an open ocean but we may suppose either that these shells were thrown during gales on flat ledges of rock just above the level of highwater mark and that during the elevation of the land they were never again touched by the waves or that during earthquakes such as those of and rocky reefs covered with marineanimals were at one blow uplifted above the future reach of the sea this latter explanation is perhaps the most probable one with respect to the beds at concepcion entirely composed of the mytilus chiloensis a species which lives below the lowest tides and likewise with respect to the great beds occurring both north and south of valparaiso of the mesodesma donaciformea shell which as i am informed by mr cuming inhabits sandbanks at the level of the lowest tides but even in the case of shells having the habits of this mytilus and mesodesma beds of them wherever the sea gently throws up sand or mud and thus protects its own accumulations might be upraised by the slowest movement and yet remain undisturbed by the waves of each new beachline it is worthy of remark that nowhere near valparaiso above the height of twenty feet or rarely of fifty feet i saw any lines of erosion on the solid rocks or any beds of pebbles this i believe may be accounted for by the disintegrating tendency of most of the rocks in this neighbourhood nor is the land here modelled into terraces mr alison however informs me that on both sides of one narrow ravine at the height of feet above the sea he found a succession of rather indistinct stepformed beaches composed of broken shells which together covered a space of about eighty feet vertical i can add nothing to the accounts already published of the elevation of the land at valparaiso which accompanied the earthquake of but i heard it confidently asserted that a sentinel on duty immediately after the shock saw a part of a fort which previously was not within the line of his vision and this would indicate that the uplifting was not horizontal it would even appear from some facts collected by mr alison that only the eastern half of the bay was then elevated through the kindness of this same gentleman i am able to give an interesting account of the changes of level which have supervened here within historical periods about the year a long seawall or prefil was built of which only a few fragments now remain up to the year the sea often broke over it and washed the houses on the opposite side of the road where the prison now stands and even in mr j martin remembers walking at the foot of this wall and being often obliged to climb over it to escape the waves there now stands on the seaward side of this wall and between it and the beach in one part a single row of houses and in another part two rows with a street between them this great extension of the beach in so short a time cannot be attributed simply to the accumulation of detritus for a resident engineer measured for me the height between the lowest part of the wall visible and the present beachline at springtides and the difference was eleven feet six inches the church of s augustin is believed to have been built in and there is a tradition that the sea formerly flowed very near it by levelling its foundations were found to stand nineteen feet six inches above the highest beachline so that we see in a period of years the elevation cannot have been as much as nineteen feet six inches from the facts given with respect to the seawall and from the testimony of the elder inhabitants it appears certain that the change in level began to be manifest about the year the only sudden elevation of which there is any record occurred in and this seems to have been less than three feet since that year i was assured by several competent observers that part of an old wreck which is firmly embedded near the beach has sensibly emerged hence here as at chiloe a slow rise of the land appears to be now in progress it seems highly probable that the rocks which are corroded in a band at the height of fourteen feet above the sea were acted on during the period when by tradition the base of s augustin church now nineteen feet six inches above the highest watermark was occasionally washed by the waves valparaiso to coquimbofor the first seventyfive miles north of valparaiso i followed the coastroad and throughout this space i observed innumerable masses of upraised shells about quintero there are immense accumulations worked for lime of the mesodesma donaciforme packed in sandy earth they abound chiefly about fifteen feet above highwater but shells are here found according to mr miers to a height of feet and at a distance of three leagues from the coast i here noticed barnacles adhering to the rocks three or four feet above the highest tides in the neighbourhood of plazilla and catapilco at heights of between and feet the number of comminuted shells with some perfect ones especially of the mesodesma packed in layers was truly immense the land at plazilla had evidently existed as a bay with abrupt rocky masses rising out of it precisely like the islets in the broken bays now indenting this coast on both sides of the rivers ligua longotomo guachen and quilimari there are plains of gravel about feet in height in many parts absolutely covered with shells close to conchalee a gravelplain is fronted by a lower and similar plain about sixty feet in height and this again is separated from the beach by a wide tract of low land the surfaces of all three plains or terraces were strewed with vast numbers of the concholepas mesodesma an existing venus and other still existing littoral shells the two upper terraces closely resemble in miniature the plains of patagonia and like them are furrowed by dry flatbottomed winding valleys northward of this place i turned inward and therefore found no more shells but the valleys of chuapa illapel and limari are bounded by gravelcapped plains often including a lower terrace within these plains send baylike arms between and into the surrounding hills and they are continuously united with other extensive gravelcapped plains separating the coast mountainranges from the cordillera coquimbo a narrow fringelike plain gently inclined towards the sea here extends for eleven miles along the coast with arms stretching up between the coastmountains and likewise up the valley of coquimbo at its southern extremity it is directly connected with the plain of limari out of which hills abruptly rise like islets and other hills project like headlands on a coast the surface of the fringelike plain appears level but differs insensibly in height and greatly in composition in different parts at the mouth of the valley of coquimbo the surface consists wholly of gravel and stands from to feet above the level of the sea being about feet higher than in other parts in these other and lower parts the superficial beds consist of calcareous matter and rest on ancient tertiary deposits hereafter to be described the uppermost calcareous layer is creamcoloured compact smoothfractured substalactiform and contains some sand earthy matter and recent shells it lies on and sends wedgelike veins into a much more friable calcareous tufflike variety and both rest on a mass about twenty feet in thickness formed of fragments of recent shells with a few whole ones and with small pebbles firmly cemented together this latter rock is called by the inhabitants losa and is used for building in many parts it is divided into strata which dip at an angle of ten degrees seaward and appear as if they had originally been heaped in successive layers as may be seen on coralreefs on a steep beach this stone is remarkable from being in parts entirely formed of empty pellucid capsules or cells of calcareous matter of the size of small seeds a series of specimens unequivocally showed that all these capsules once contained minute rounded fragments of shells which have since been gradually dissolved by water percolating through the mass although these species are all recent and are all found in the neighbouring sea yet i was particularly struck with the difference in the proportional numbers of the several species and of those now cast up on the present beach i found only one specimen of the concholepas and the pecten was very rare though both these shells are now the commonest kinds with the exception perhaps of the calyptræa radians of which i did not find one in the calcareous beds i will not pretend to determine how far this difference in the proportional numbers depends on the age of the deposit and how
