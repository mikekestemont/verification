great advantage it is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed except in some rare cases by the flies but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced so that they are more subject to disease or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food or to escape from beasts of prey organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high importance to an early progenitor and after having been slowly perfected at a former period have been transmitted in nearly the same state although now become of very slight use and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their aquatic origin may perhaps be thus accounted for a welldeveloped tail having been formed in an aquatic animal it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes as a flyflapper an organ of prehension or as an aid in turning as with the dog though the aid must be slight for the hare with hardly any tail can double quickly enough in the second place we may sometimes attribute importance to characters which are really of very little importance and which have originated from quite secondary causes independently of natural selection we should remember that climate food c probably have some little direct influence on the organisation that characters reappear from the law of reversion that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures and finally that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external characters of animals having a will to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes it may at first have been of no advantage to the species but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits to give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks if green woodpeckers alone had existed and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds i dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this treefrequenting bird from its enemies and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection as it is i have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelego climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance no doubt is of the highest service to the plant but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber the naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the cleanfeeding male turkey is likewise naked the sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this act but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals we are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countriesmore especially in the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial selection careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair and that with the hair the horns are correlated mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more and possibly even the form of the pelvis and then by the law of homologous variation the front limbs and even the head would probably be affected the shape also of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb the laborious breathing necessary in high regions would we have some reason to believe increase the size of the chest and again correlation would come into play animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates and there is reason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated a good observer also states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection but we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation and i have here alluded to them only to show that if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our domestic breeds which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences between species i might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man which are so strongly marked i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theory yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure quite independently of any good thus gained correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use so again characters which formerly were useful or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth or from other unknown cause may reappear from the law of reversion though now of no direct use the effects of sexual selection when displayed in beauty to charm the females can be called useful only in rather a forced sense but by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance and consequently though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species thus we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the frigatebird are of special use to these birds we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey in the fore leg of the horse in the wing of the bat and in the flipper of the seal are of special use to these animals we may safely attribute these structures to inheritance but to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigatebird webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds so we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey horse and bat which have been inherited from a common progenitor were formerly of more special use to that progenitor or its progenitors than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection subjected formerly as now to the several laws of inheritance reversion correlation of growth c hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this formeither directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one species exclusively for the good of another species though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of and profits by the structure of another but natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species as we see in the fang of the adder and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon by which its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects if it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species it would annihilate my theory for such could not have been produced through natural selection although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect i cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight it is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poisonfang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey but some authors suppose that at the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury namely to warn its prey to escape i would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring in order to warn the doomed mouse but i have not space here to enter on this and other such cases natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to itself for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each no organ will be formed as paley has remarked for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor if a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part each will be found on the whole advantageous after the lapse of time under changing conditions of life if any part comes to be injurious it will be modified or if it be not so the being will become extinct as myriads have become extinct natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence and we see that this is the degree of perfection attained under nature the endemic productions of new zealand for instance are perfect one compared with another but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from europe natural selection will not produce absolute perfection nor do we always meet as far as we can judge with this high standard under nature the correction for the aberration of light is said on high authority not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ the eye if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tells us though we may easily err on both sides that some other contrivances are less perfect can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when used against many attacking animals cannot be withdrawn owing to the backward serratures and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera if we look at the sting of the bee as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument like that in so many members of the same great order and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insects own death for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection though it may cause the death of some few members if we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones which are utterly useless to the community for any other end and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters it may be difficult but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queenbee which urges her instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born or to perish herself in the combat for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community and maternal love or maternal hatred though the latter fortunately is most rare is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection if we admire the several ingenious contrivances by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are fertilised through insect agency can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration by our firtrees of dense clouds of pollen in order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules summary of chapterwe have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory many of them are very grave but i think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure we have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow and will act at any one time only on a very few forms and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations closely allied species now living on a continuous area must often have been formed when the area was not continuous and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another when two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area an intermediate variety will often be formed fitted for an intermediate zone but from reasons assigned the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects consequently the two latter during the course of further modification from existing in greater numbers will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it we have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each other that a bat for instance could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air we have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its habits or have diversified habits with some habits very unlike those of its nearest congeners hence we can understand bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet ground woodpeckers diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger any one yet in the case of any organ if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity each good for its possessor then under changing conditions of life there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection in the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible for instance a swimbladder has apparently been converted into an airbreathing lung the same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions and then having been specialised for one function and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other must often have largely facilitated transitions we are far too ignorant in almost every case to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection but we may confidently believe that many modifications wholly due to the laws of growth and at first in no way advantageous to a species have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species we may also believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants though it has become of such small importance that it could not in its present state have been acquired by natural selectiona power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another though it may well produce parts organs and excretions highly useful or even indispensable or highly injurious to another species but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner natural selection in each wellstocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another and consequently will produce perfection or strength in the battle for life only according to the standard of that country hence the inhabitants of one country generally the smaller one will often yield as we see they do yield to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country for in the larger country there will have existed more individuals and more diversified forms and the competition will have been severer and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher natural selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection nor as far as we can judge by our limited faculties can absolute perfection be everywhere found on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history natura non facit saltum this canon if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world is not strictly correct but if we include all those of past times it must by my theory be strictly true it is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great lawsunity of type and the conditions of existence by unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic beings of the same class and which is quite independent of their habits of life on my theory unity of type is explained by unity of descent the expression of conditions of existence so often insisted on by the illustrious cuvier is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection for natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life or by having adapted them during longpast periods of time the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth hence in fact the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law as it includes through the inheritance of former adaptations that of unity of type chapter vii instinct instincts comparable with habits but different in their origin instincts graduated aphides and ants instincts variable domestic instincts their origin natural instincts of the cuckoo ostrich and parasitic bees slavemaking ants hivebee its cellmaking instinct difficulties on the theory of the natural selection of instincts neuter or sterile insects summary the subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters but i have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject separately especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hivebee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory i must premise that i have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers any more than i have with that of life itself we are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class i will not attempt any definition of instinct it would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term but every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests an action which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to perform when performed by an animal more especially by a very young one without any experience and when performed by many individuals in the same way without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually said to be instinctive but i could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal a little dose as pierre huber expresses it of judgment or reason often comes into play even in animals very low in the scale of nature frederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit this comparison gives i think a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed but not of its origin how unconsciously many habitual actions are performed indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will yet they may be modified by the will or reason habits easily become associated with other habits and with certain periods of time and states of the body when once acquired they often remain constant throughout life several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out as in repeating a wellknown song so in instincts one action follows another by a sort of rhythm if a person be interrupted in a song or in repeating anything by rote he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought so p huber found it was with a caterpillar which makes a very complicated hammock for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to say the sixth stage of construction and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage the caterpillar simply reperformed the fourth fifth and sixth stages of construction if however a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up for instance to the third stage and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage so that much of its work was already done for it far from feeling the benefit of this it was much embarrassed and in order to complete its hammock seemed forced to start from the third stage where it had left off and thus tried to complete the already finished work if we suppose any habitual action to become inheritedand i think it can be shown that this does sometimes happenthen the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished if mozart instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice had played a tune with no practice at all he might truly be said to have done so instinctively but it would be the most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations it can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted namely those of the hivebee and of many ants could not possibly have been thus acquired it will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare of each species under its present conditions of life under changed conditions of life it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little then i can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable it is thus as i believe that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated as modifications of corporeal structure arise from and are increased by use or habit and are diminished or lost by disuse so i do not doubt it has been with instincts but i believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instinctsthat is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure no complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yet profitable variations hence as in the case of corporeal structures we ought to find in nature not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquiredfor these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each speciesbut we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible and this we certainly can do i have been surprised to find making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in europe and north america and for no instinct being known amongst extinct species how very generally gradations leading to the most complex instincts can be discovered the canon of natura non facit saltum applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life or at different seasons of the year or when placed under different circumstances c in which case either one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection and such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature again as in the case of corporeal structure and conformably with my theory the instinct of each species is good for itself but has never as far as we can judge been produced for the exclusive good of others one of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another with which i am acquainted is that of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants that they do so voluntarily the following facts show i removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dockplant and prevented their attendance during several hours after this interval i felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete i watched them for some time through a lens but not one excreted i then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as i could as the ants do with their antennæ but not one excreted afterwards i allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered it then began to play with its antennæ on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each aphis as soon as it felt the antennæ immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of experience but as the excretion is extremely viscid it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it removed and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants although i do not believe that any animal in the world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others so again in some few cases certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable they may be here passed over as some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature and the inheritance of such variations are indispensable for the action of natural selection as many instances as possible ought to have been here given but want of space prevents me i can only assert that instincts certainly do varyfor instance the migratory instinct both in extent and direction and in its total loss so it is with the nests of birds which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited but often from causes wholly unknown to us audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in nests of the same species in the northern and southern united states fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality as may be seen in nestling birds though it is strengthened by experience and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals but fear of man is slowly acquired as i have elsewhere shown by various animals inhabiting desert islands and we may see an instance of this even in england in the greater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds for the large birds have been most persecuted by man we may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small and the magpie so wary in england is tame in norway as is the hooded crow in egypt that the general disposition of individuals of the same species born in a state of nature is extremely diversified can be shown by a multitude of facts several cases also could be given of occasional and strange habits in certain species which might if advantageous to the species give rise through natural selection to quite new instincts but i am well aware that these general statements without facts given in detail can produce but a feeble effect on the readers mind i can only repeat my assurance that i do not speak without good evidence the possibility or even probability of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication we shall thus also be enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of socalled accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals a number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes and likewise of the oddest tricks associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time but let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds of dogs it cannot be doubted that young pointers i have myself seen a striking instance will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers and a tendency to run round instead of at a flock of sheep by shepherddogs i cannot see that these actions performed without experience by the young and in nearly the same manner by each individual performed with eager delight by each breed and without the end being knownfor the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbagei cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts if we were to see one kind of wolf when young and without any training as soon as it scented its prey stand motionless like a statue and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait and another kind of wolf rushing round instead of at a herd of deer and driving them to a distant point we should assuredly call these actions instinctive domestic instincts as they may be called are certainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period under less fixed conditions of life how strongly these domestic instincts habits and dispositions are inherited and how curiously they become mingled is well shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed thus it is known that a cross with a bulldog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherddogs a tendency to hunt hares these domestic instincts when thus tested by crossing resemble natural instincts which in a like manner become curiously blended together and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent for example le roy describes a dog whose greatgrandfather was a wolf and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way by not coming in a straight line to his master when called domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from longcontinued and compulsory habit but this i think is not true no one would ever have thought of teaching or probably could have taught the tumblerpigeon to tumblean action which as i have witnessed is performed by young birds that have never seen a pigeon tumble we may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit and that the longcontinued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are and near glasgow there are housetumblers as i hear from mr brent which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels it may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line and this is known occasionally to happen as i once saw in a pure terrier when the first tendency was once displayed methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the work and unconscious selection is still at work as each man tries to procure without intending to improve the breed dogs which will stand and hunt best on the other hand habit alone in some cases has sufficed no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit but i do not suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness and i presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness simply to habit and longcontinued close confinement natural instincts are lost under domestication a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become broody that is never wish to sit on their eggs familiarity alone prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic animals have been modified by domestication it is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog all wolves foxes jackals and species of the cat genus when kept tame are most eager to attack poultry sheep and pigs and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries such as tierra del fuego and australia where the savages do not keep these domestic animals how rarely on the other hand do our civilised dogs even when quite young require to be taught not to attack poultry sheep and pigs no doubt they occasionally do make an attack and are then beaten and if not cured they are destroyed so that habit with some degree of selection has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs on the other hand young chickens have lost wholly by habit that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in young pheasants though reared under a hen it is not that chickens have lost all fear but fear only of dogs and cats for if the hen gives the dangerchuckle they will run more especially young turkeys from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing as we see in wild groundbirds their mother to fly away but this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication for the motherhen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight hence we may conclude that domestic instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost partly by habit and partly by man selecting and accumulating during successive generations peculiar mental habits and actions which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident in some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing and all has been the result of selection pursued both methodically and unconsciously but in most cases probably habit and selection have acted together we shall perhaps best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection by considering a few cases i will select only three out of the several which i shall have to discuss in my future worknamely the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds nests the slavemaking instinct of certain ants and the combmaking power of the hivebee these two latter instincts have generally and most justly been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts it is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoos instinct is that she lays her eggs not daily but at intervals of two or three days so that if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest if this were the case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone but the american cuckoo is in this predicament for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched all at the same time it has been asserted that the american cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds nests but i hear on the high authority of dr brewer that this is a mistake nevertheless i could give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds nests now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our european cuckoo had the habits of the american cuckoo but that occasionally she laid an egg in another birds nest if the old bird profited by this occasional habit or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird than by their own mothers care encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage and analogy would lead me to believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds nests and thus be successful in rearing their young by a continued process of this nature i believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be and has been generated i may add that according to dr gray and to some other observers the european cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and care for her own offspring the occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds nests either of the same or of a distinct species is not very uncommon with the gallinaceæ and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in the allied group of ostriches for several hen ostriches at least in the case of the american species unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another and these are hatched by the males this instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs but as in the case of the cuckoo at intervals of two or three days this instinct however of the american ostrich has not as yet been perfected for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains so that in one days hunting i picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs many bees are parasitic and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of other kinds this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits for they do not possess the pollencollecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store food for their own young some species likewise of sphegidæ wasplike insects are parasitic on other species and m fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvæ to feed on yet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex it takes advantage of the prize and becomes for the occasion parasitic in this case as with the supposed case of the cuckoo i can see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent if of advantage to the species and if the insect whose nest and stored food are thus feloniously appropriated be not thus exterminated slavemaking instinctthis remarkable instinct was first discovered in the formica polyerges rufescens by pierre huber a better observer even than his celebrated father this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves without their aid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year the males and fertile females do no work the workers or sterile females though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves do no other work they are incapable of making their own nests or of feeding their own larvæ when the old nest is found inconvenient and they have to migrate it is the slaves which determine the migration and actually carry their masters in their jaws so utterly helpless are the masters that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plenty of the food which they like best and with their larvæ and pupæ to stimulate them to work they did nothing they could not even feed themselves and many perished of hunger huber then introduced a single slave f fusca and she instantly set to work fed and saved the survivors made some cells and tended the larvæ and put all to rights what can be more extraordinary than these wellascertained facts if we had not known of any other slavemaking ant it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by p huber to be a slavemaking ant this species is found in the southern parts of england and its habits have been attended to by mr f smith of the british museum to whom i am much indebted for information on this and other subjects although fully trusting to the statements of huber and mr smith i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves hence i will give the observations which i have myself made in some little detail i opened fourteen nests of f sanguinea and found a few slaves in all males and fertile females of the slavespecies are found only in their own proper communities and have never been observed in the nests of f sanguinea the slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters so that the contrast in their appearance is very great when the nest is slightly disturbed the slaves occasionally come out and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest when the nest is much disturbed and the larvæ and pupæ are exposed the slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety hence it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home during the months of june and july on three successive years i have watched for many hours several nests in surrey and sussex and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest as during these months the slaves are very few in number i thought that they might behave differently when more numerous but mr smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during may june and august both in surrey and hampshire and has never seen the slaves though present in large numbers in august either leave or enter the nest hence he considers them as strictly household slaves the masters on the other hand may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest and food of all kinds during the present year however in the month of july i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves and i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest and marching along the same road to a tall scotchfirtree twentyfive yards distant which they ascended together probably in search of aphides or cocci according to huber who had ample opportunities for observation in switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening and as huber expressly states their principal office is to search for aphides this difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in switzerland than in england one day i fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to another and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying as huber has described their slaves in their jaws another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slavemakers haunting the same spot and evidently not in search of food they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species f fusca sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slavemaking f sanguinea the latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest twentynine yards distant but they were prevented from getting any pupæ to rear as slaves i then dug up a small parcel of the pupæ of f fusca from another nest and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all they had been victorious in their late combat at the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupæ of another species f flava with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of the nest this species is sometimes though rarely made into slaves as has been described by mr smith although so small a species it is very courageous and i have seen it ferociously attack other ants in one instance i found to my surprise an independent community of f flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slavemaking f sanguinea and when i had accidentally disturbed both nests the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage now i was curious to ascertain whether f sanguinea could distinguish the pupæ of f fusca which they habitually make into slaves from those of the little and furious f flava which they rarely capture and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupæ of f fusca whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupæ or even the earth from the nest of f flava and quickly ran away but in about a quarter of an hour shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away they took heart and carried off the pupæ one evening i visited another community of f sanguinea and found a number of these ants entering their nest carrying the dead bodies of f fusca showing that it was not a migration and numerous pupæ i traced the returning file burthened with booty for about forty yards to a very thick clump of heath whence i saw the last individual of f sanguinea emerge carrying a pupa but i was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath the nest however must have been close at hand for two or three individuals of f fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged home such are the facts though they did not need confirmation by me in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of f sanguinea present with those of the f rufescens the latter does not build its own nest does not determine its own migrations does not collect food for itself or its young and cannot even feed itself it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves formica sanguinea on the other hand possesses much fewer slaves and in the early part of the summer extremely few the masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed and when they migrate the masters carry the slaves both in switzerland and england the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvæ and the masters alone go on slavemaking expeditions in switzerland the slaves and masters work together making and bringing materials for the nest both but chiefly the slaves tend and milk as it may be called their aphides and thus both collect food for the community in england the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves their slaves and larvæ so that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in switzerland by what steps the instinct of f sanguinea originated i will not pretend to conjecture but as ants which are not slavemakers will as i have seen carry off pupæ of other species if scattered near their nests it is possible that pupæ originally stored as food might become developed and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts and do what work they could if their presence proved useful to the species which had seized themif it were more advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate themthe habit of collecting pupæ originally for food might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves when the instinct was once acquired if carried out to a much less extent even than in our british f sanguinea which as we have seen is less aided by its slaves than the same species in switzerland i can see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the instinctalways supposing each modification to be of use to the speciesuntil an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the formica rufescens cellmaking instinct of the hivebeei will not here enter on minute details on this subject but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which i have arrived he must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb so beautifully adapted to its end without enthusiastic admiration we hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction it has been remarked that a skilful workman with fitting tools and measures would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form though this is perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive grant whatever instincts you please and it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes or even perceive when they are correctly made but the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears all this beautiful work can be shown i think to follow from a few very simple instincts i was led to investigate this subject by mr waterhouse who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells and the following view may perhaps be considered only as a modification of his theory let us look to the great principle of gradation and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method of work at one end of a short series we have humblebees which use their old cocoons to hold honey sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax at the other end of the series we have the cells of the hivebee placed in a double layer each cell as is well known is an hexagonal prism with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid formed of three rhombs these rhombs have certain angles and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side in the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hivebee and the simplicity of those of the humblebee we have the cells of the mexican melipona domestica carefully described and figured by pierre huber the melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee but more nearly related to the latter it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells in which the young are hatched and in addition some large cells of wax for holding honey these latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes and are aggregated into an irregular mass but the important point to notice is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed but this is never permitted the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two three or more perfectly flat surfaces according as the cell adjoins two three or more other cells when one cell comes into contact with three other cells which from the spheres being nearly of the same size is very frequently and necessarily the case the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid and this pyramid as huber has remarked is manifestly a gross imitation of the threesided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hivebee as in the cells of the hivebee so here the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells it is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells reflecting on this case it occurred to me that if the melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer the resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the hivebee accordingly i wrote to professor miller of cambridge and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement drawn up from his information and tells me that it is strictly correct if a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius or radius or at some lesser distance from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer then if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hivebee hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the melipona and
