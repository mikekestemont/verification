is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points this is hardly ever perhaps never the case the laws of correlation of growth the importance of which should never be overlooked will ensure some differences but as a general rule i cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations either in the leaves the flowers or the fruit will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than threequarters of a century it has certainly been more attended to of late years and many treatises have been published on the subject and the result i may add has been in a corresponding degree rapid and important but it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery i could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity in rude and barbarous periods of english history choice animals were often imported and laws were passed to prevent their exportation the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered and this may be compared to the roguing of plants by nurserymen the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopædia explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers from passages in genesis it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals to improve the breed and they formerly did so as is attested by passages in pliny the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of africa who have not associated with europeans some of these facts do not show actual selection but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times and is now attended to by the lowest savages it would indeed have been a strange fact had attention not been paid to breeding for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious at the present time eminent breeders try by methodical selection with a distinct object in view to make a new strain or subbreed superior to anything existing in the country but for our purpose a kind of selection which may be called unconscious and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals is more important thus a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed nevertheless i cannot doubt that this process continued during centuries would improve and modify any breed in the same way as bakewell collins c by this very same process only carried on more methodically did greatly modify even during their own lifetimes the forms and qualities of their cattle slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago which might serve for comparison in some cases however unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts where the breed has been less improved there is reason to believe that king charless spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel and has probably been slowly altered from it it is known that the english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century and in this case the change has it is believed been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound but what concerns us is that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually and yet so effectually that though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain mr borrow has not seen as i am informed by him any native dog in spain like our pointer by a similar process of selection and by careful training the whole body of english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent arab stock so that the latter by the regulations for the goodwood races are favoured in the weights they carry lord spencer and others have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity compared with the stock formerly kept in this country by comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in britain india and persia we can i think clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed and come to differ so greatly from the rockpigeon youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconsciously followed in so far that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced the result which ensuednamely the production of two distinct strains the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr buckley and mr burgess as mr youatt remarks have been purely bred from the original stock of mr bakewell for upwards of fifty years there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr bakewells flock and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals yet any one animal particularly useful to them for any special purpose would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents to which savages are so liable and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego by their killing and devouring their old women in times of dearth as of less value than their dogs in plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease rose pelargonium dahlia and other plants when compared with the older varieties or with their parentstocks no one would ever expect to get a firstrate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant no one would expect to raise a firstrate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild if it had come from a gardenstock the pear though cultivated in classical times appears from plinys description to have been a fruit of very inferior quality i have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials but the art i cannot doubt has been simple and as far as the final result is concerned has been followed almost unconsciously it has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety sowing its seeds and when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear selecting it and so onwards but the gardeners of the classical period who cultivated the best pear they could procure never thought what splendid fruit we should eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find a large amount of change in our cultivated plants thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated explains as i believe the wellknown fact that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise and therefore do not know the wild parentstocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens if it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man we can understand how it is that neither australia the cape of good hope nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man has afforded us a single plant worth culture it is not that these countries so rich in species do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food at least during certain seasons and in two countries very differently circumstanced individuals of the same species having slightly different constitutions or structure would often succeed better in the one country than in the other and thus by a process of natural selection as will hereafter be more fully explained two subbreeds might be formed this perhaps partly explains what has been remarked by some authors namely that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries on the view here given of the allimportant part which selection by man has played it becomes at once obvious how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to mans wants or fancies we can i think further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs man can hardly select or only with much difficulty any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal he can never act by selection excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature no man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared the more likely it would be to catch his attention but to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is i have no doubt in most cases utterly incorrect the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through longcontinued partly unconscious and partly methodical selection perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tailfeathers somewhat expanded like the present java fantail or like individuals of other and distinct breeds in which as many as seventeen tailfeathers have been counted perhaps the first pouterpigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its œsophagusa habit which is disregarded by all fanciers as it is not one of the points of the breed nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fanciers eye he perceives extremely small differences and it is in human nature to value any novelty however slight in ones own possession nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species be judged of by the value which would now be set on them after several breeds have once fairly been established many slight differences might and indeed do now arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed the common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties hence the thoulouse and the common breed which differ only in colour that most fleeting of characters have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultryshows i think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticednamely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds but in fact a breed like a dialect of a language can hardly be said to have had a definite origin a man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood but as yet they will hardly have a distinct name and from being only slightly valued their history will be disregarded when further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable and will then probably first receive a provincial name in semicivilised countries with little free communication the spreading and knowledge of any new subbreed will be a slow process as soon as the points of value of the new subbreed are once fully acknowledged the principle as i have called it of unconscious selection will always tendperhaps more at one period than at another as the breed rises or falls in fashionperhaps more in one district than in another according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitantsslowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed whatever they may be but the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow varying and insensible changes i must now say a few words on the circumstances favourable or the reverse to mans power of selection a high degree of variability is obviously favourable as freely giving the materials for selection to work on not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient with extreme care to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction but as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success on this principle marshall has remarked with respect to the sheep of parts of yorkshire that as they generally belong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can be improved on the other hand nurserymen from raising large stocks of the same plants are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties the keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life so as to breed freely in that country when the individuals of any species are scanty all the individuals whatever their quality may be will generally be allowed to breed and this will effectually prevent selection but probably the most important point of all is that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man or so much valued by him that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected i have seen it gravely remarked that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this plant no doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated but the slight varieties had been neglected as soon however as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger earlier or better fruit and raised seedlings from them and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them then there appeared aided by some crossing with distinct species those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years in the case of animals with separate sexes facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new racesat least in a country which is already stocked with other races in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species pigeons can be mated for life and this is a great convenience to the fancier for thus many races may be kept true though mingled in the same aviary and this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds pigeons i may add can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate and inferior birds may be freely rejected as when killed they serve for food on the other hand cats from their nocturnal rambling habits cannot be matched and although so much valued by women and children we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country often from islands although i do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat the donkey peacock goose c may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play in cats from the difficulty in pairing them in donkeys from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding in peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept in geese from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants i believe that the conditions of life from their action on the reproductive system are so far of the highest importance as causing variability i do not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency under all circumstances with all organic beings as some authors have thought the effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion variability is governed by many unknown laws more especially by that of correlation of growth something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life something must be attributed to use and disuse the final result is thus rendered infinitely complex in some cases i do not doubt that the intercrossing of species aboriginally distinct has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions when in any country several domestic breeds have once been established their occasional intercrossing with the aid of selection has no doubt largely aided in the formation of new subbreeds but the importance of the crossing of varieties has i believe been greatly exaggerated both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed in plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings buds c the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels and the frequent sterility of hybrids but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us for their endurance is only temporary over all these causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative action of selection whether applied methodically and more quickly or unconsciously and more slowly but more efficiently is by far the predominant power chapter ii variation under nature variability individual differences doubtful species wide ranging much diffused and common species vary most species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely but unequally related to each other and in having restricted ranges before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation to treat this subject at all properly a long catalogue of dry facts should be given but these i shall reserve for my future work nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species no one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation the term variety is almost equally difficult to define but here community of descent is almost universally implied though it can rarely be proved we have also what are called monstrosities but they graduate into varieties by a monstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part either injurious to or not useful to the species and not generally propagated some authors use the term variation in a technical sense as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life and variations in this sense are supposed not to be inherited but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the baltic or dwarfed plants on alpine summits or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards would not in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations and in this case i presume that the form would be called a variety again we have many slight differences which may be called individual differences such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from the same parents or which may be presumed to have thus arisen from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality no one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould these individual differences are highly important for us as they afford materials for natural selection to accumulate in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions these individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts but i could show by a long catalogue of facts that parts which must be called important whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability even in important parts of structure which he could collect on good authority as i have collected during a course of years it should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important characters and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs and compare them in many specimens of the same species i should never have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species i should have expected that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees yet quite recently mr lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree this philosophical naturalist i may add has also quite recently shown that the muscles in the larvæ of certain insects are very far from uniform authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary for these same authors practically rank that character as important as some few naturalists have honestly confessed which does not vary and under this point of view no instance of an important part varying will ever be found but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given there is one point connected with individual differences which seems to me extremely perplexing i refer to those genera which have sometimes been called protean or polymorphic in which the species present an inordinate amount of variation and hardly two naturalists can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties we may instance rubus rosa and hieracium amongst plants several genera of insects and several genera of brachiopod shells in most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be with some few exceptions polymorphic in other countries and likewise judging from brachiopod shells at former periods of time these facts seem to be very perplexing for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life i am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection as hereafter will be explained those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species but which are so closely similar to some other forms or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species are in several respects the most important for us we have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closelyallied forms have permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long time for as long as far as we know as have good and true species practically when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters he treats the one as a variety of the other ranking the most common but sometimes the one first described as the species and the other as the variety but cases of great difficulty which i will not here enumerate sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another even when they are closely connected by intermediate links nor will the commonlyassumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty in very many cases however one form is ranked as a variety of another not because the intermediate links have actually been found but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist or may formerly have existed and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened hence in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow we must however in many cases decide by a majority of naturalists for few wellmarked and wellknown varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed compare the several floras of great britain of france or of the united states drawn up by different botanists and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species and by another as mere varieties mr h c watson to whom i lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds has marked for me british plants which are generally considered as varieties but which have all been ranked by botanists as species and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera under genera including the most polymorphic forms mr babington gives species whereas mr bentham gives only a difference of doubtful forms amongst animals which unite for each birth and which are highly locomotive doubtful forms ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety can rarely be found within the same country but are common in separated areas how many of those birds and insects in north america and europe which differ very slightly from each other have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species and by another as varieties or as they are often called as geographical races many years ago when comparing and seeing others compare the birds from the separate islands of the galapagos archipelago both one with another and with those from the american mainland i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties on the islets of the little madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in mr wollastons admirable work but which it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists even ireland has a few animals now generally regarded as varieties but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists several most experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a stronglymarked race of a norwegian species whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to great britain a wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species but what distance it has been well asked will suffice if that between america and europe is ample will that between the continent and the azores or madeira or the canaries or ireland be sufficient it must be admitted that many forms considered by highlycompetent judges as varieties have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other highly competent judges as good and true species but to discuss whether they are rightly called species or varieties before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted is vainly to beat the air many of the cases of stronglymarked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration for several interesting lines of argument from geographical distribution analogical variation hybridism c have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank i will here give only a single instancethe wellknown one of the primrose and cowslip or primula veris and elatior these plants differ considerably in appearance they have a different flavour and emit a different odour they flower at slightly different periods they grow in somewhat different stations they ascend mountains to different heights they have different geographical ranges and lastly according to very numerous experiments made during several years by that most careful observer gärtner they can be crossed only with much difficulty we could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct on the other hand they are united by many intermediate links and it is very doubtful whether these links are hybrids and there is as it seems to me an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence showing that they descend from common parents and consequently must be ranked as varieties close investigation in most cases will bring naturalists to an agreement how to rank doubtful forms yet it must be confessed that it is in the bestknown countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful value i have been struck with the fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man or from any cause closely attract his attention varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded these varieties moreover will be often ranked by some authors as species look at the common oak how closely it has been studied yet a german author makes more than a dozen species out of forms which are very generally considered as varieties and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties when a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific and what as varieties for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject and this shows at least how very generally there is some variation but if he confine his attention to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms his general tendency will be to make many species for he will become impressed just like the pigeon or poultryfancier before alluded to with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first impressions as he extends the range of his observations he will meet with more cases of difficulty for he will encounter a greater number of closelyallied forms but if his observations be widely extended he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variationand the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists when moreover he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous in which case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy and his difficulties will rise to a climax certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and subspeciesthat is the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank of species or again between subspecies and wellmarked varieties or between lesser varieties and individual differences these differences blend into each other in an insensible series and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage hence i look at individual differences though of small interest to the systematist as of high importance for us as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history and i look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent as steps leading to more strongly marked and more permanent varieties and at these latter as leading to subspecies and to species the passage from one stage of difference to another and higher stage may be in some cases due merely to the longcontinued action of different physical conditions in two different regions but i have not much faith in this view and i attribute the passage of a variety from a state in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more to the action of natural selection in accumulating as will hereafter be more fully explained differences of structure in certain definite directions hence i believe a wellmarked variety may be justly called an incipient species but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work it need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species they may whilst in this incipient state become extinct or they may endure as varieties for very long periods as has been shown to be the case by mr wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil landshells in madeira if a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species it would then rank as the species and the species as the variety or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species or both might coexist and both rank as independent species but we shall hereafter have to return to this subject from these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms the term variety again in comparison with mere individual differences is also applied arbitrarily and for mere convenience sake guided by theoretical considerations i thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most by tabulating all the varieties in several wellworked floras at first this seemed a simple task but mr h c watson to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on this subject soon convinced me that there were many difficulties as did subsequently dr hooker even in stronger terms i shall reserve for my future work the discussion of these difficulties and the tables themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species dr hooker permits me to add that after having carefully read my manuscript and examined the tables he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established the whole subject however treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity is rather perplexing and allusions cannot be avoided to the struggle for existence divergence of character and other questions hereafter to be discussed alph de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties and this might have been expected as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions and as they come into competition which as we shall hereafter see is a far more important circumstance with different sets of organic beings but my tables further show that in any limited country the species which are most common that is abound most in individuals and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country and this is a different consideration from wide range and to a certain extent from commonness often give rise to varieties sufficiently wellmarked to have been recorded in botanical works hence it is the most flourishing or as they may be called the dominant species those which range widely over the world are the most diffused in their own country and are the most numerous in individualswhich oftenest produce wellmarked varieties or as i consider them incipient species and this perhaps might have been anticipated for as varieties in order to become in any degree permanent necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring which though in some slight degree modified will still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots if the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be divided into two equal masses all those in the larger genera being placed on one side and all those in the smaller genera on the other side a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera this again might have been anticipated for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus and consequently we might have expected to have found in the larger genera or those including many species a large proportional number of dominant species but so many causes tend to obscure this result that i am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera i will here allude to only two causes of obscurity freshwater and saltloving plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong again plants low in the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera the cause of lowlyorganised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution from looking at species as only stronglymarked and welldefined varieties i was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties than the species of the smaller genera for wherever many closely related species ie species of the same genus have been formed many varieties or incipient species ought as a general rule to be now forming where many large trees grow we expect to find saplings where many species of a genus have been formed through variation circumstances have been favourable for variation and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to variation on the other hand if we look at each species as a special act of creation there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species than in one having few to test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants of twelve countries and the coleopterous insects of two districts into two nearly equal masses the species of the larger genera on one side and those of the smaller genera on the other side and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties than on the side of the smaller genera moreover the species of the large genera which present any varieties invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera both these results follow when another division is made and when all the smallest genera with from only one to four species are absolutely excluded from the tables these facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed or where if we may use the expression the manufactory of species has been active we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one and this certainly is the case if varieties be looked at as incipient species for my tables clearly show as a general rule that wherever many species of a genus have been formed the species of that genus present a number of varieties that is of incipient species beyond the average it is not that all large genera are now varying much and are thus increasing in the number of their species or that no small genera are now varying and increasing for if this had been so it would have been fatal to my theory inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size and that large genera have often come to their maxima declined and disappeared all that we want to show is that where many species of a genus have been formed on an average many are still forming and this holds good there are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice we have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and wellmarked varieties and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties now fries has remarked in regard to plants and westwood in regard to insects that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small i have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages and as far as my imperfect results go they always confirm the view i have also consulted some sagacious and most experienced observers and after deliberation they concur in this view in this respect therefore the species of the larger genera resemble varieties more than do the species of the smaller genera or the case may be put in another way and it may be said that in the larger genera in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference moreover the species of the large genera are related to each other in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other no naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other they may generally be divided into subgenera or sections or lesser groups as fries has well remarked little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species and what are varieties but groups of forms unequally related to each other and clustered round certain formsthat is round their parentspecies undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species namely that the amount of difference between varieties when compared with each other or with their parentspecies is much less than that between the species of the same genus but when we come to discuss the principle as i call it of divergence of character we shall see how this may be explained and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species there is one other point which seems to me worth notice varieties generally have much restricted ranges this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parentspecies their denominations ought to be reversed but there is also reason to believe that those species which are very closely allied to other species and in so far resemble varieties often have much restricted ranges for instance mr h c watson has marked for me in the wellsifted london catalogue of plants th edition plants which are therein ranked as species but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value these reputed species range on an average over of the provinces into which mr watson has divided great britain now in this same catalogue acknowledged varieties are recorded and these range over provinces whereas the species to which these varieties belong range over provinces so that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range as have those very closely allied forms marked for me by mr watson as doubtful species but which are almost universally ranked by british botanists as good and true species finally then varieties have the same general characters as species for they cannot be distinguished from speciesexcept firstly by the discovery of intermediate linking forms and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect and except secondly by a certain amount of difference for two forms if differing very little are generally ranked as varieties notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite in genera having more than the average number of species in any country the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties in large genera the species are apt to be closely but unequally allied together forming little clusters round certain species species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges in all these several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties and we can clearly understand these analogies if species have once existed as varieties and have thus originated whereas these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created we have also seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species of the larger genera which on an average vary most and varieties as we shall hereafter see tend to become converted into new and distinct species the larger genera thus tend to become larger and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants but by steps hereafter to be explained the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera and thus the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups chapter iii struggle for existence bears on natural selection the term used in a wide sense geometrical powers of increase rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants nature of the checks to increase competition universal effects of climate protection from the number of individuals complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species often severe between species of the same genus the relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations before entering on the subject of this chapter i must make a few preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on natural selection it has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability indeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed it is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or subspecies or varieties what rank for instance the two or three hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold if the existence of any wellmarked varieties be admitted but the mere existence of individual variability and of some few wellmarked varieties though necessary as the foundation for the work helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature how have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part and to the conditions of life and of one distinct organic being to another being been perfected we see these beautiful coadaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world again it may be asked how is it that varieties which i have called incipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinct species which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species how do those groups of species which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus arise all these results as we shall more fully see in the next chapter follow inevitably from the struggle for life owing to this struggle for life any variation however slight and from whatever cause proceeding if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature will tend to the preservation of that individual and will generally be inherited by its offspring the offspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving for of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born but a small number can survive i have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term of natural selection in order to mark its relation to mans power of selection we have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results and can adapt organic beings to his own uses through the accumulation of slight but useful variations given to him by the hand of nature but natural selection as we shall hereafter see is a power incessantly ready for action and is as immeasurably superior to mans feeble efforts as the works of nature are to those of art we will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence in my future work this subject shall be treated as it well deserves at much greater length the elder de candolle and lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition in regard to plants no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than w herbert dean of manchester evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or more difficultat least i have found it sothan constantly to bear this conclusion in mind yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind i am convinced that the whole economy of nature with every fact on distribution rarity abundance extinction and variation will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood we behold the face of nature bright with gladness we often see superabundance of food we do not see or we forget that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds and are thus constantly destroying life or we forget how largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey we do not always bear in mind that though food may be now superabundant it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year i should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another and including which is more important not only the life of the individual but success in leaving progeny two canine animals in a time of dearth may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live but a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture a plant which annually produces a thousand seeds of which on an average only one comes to maturity may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees but can only in a farfetched sense be said to struggle with these trees for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree it will languish and die but several seedling missletoes growing close together on the same branch may more truly be said to struggle with each other as the missletoe is disseminated by birds its existence depends on birds and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruitbearing plants in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants in these several senses which pass into each other i use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence a struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase every being which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destruction during some period of its life and during some season or occasional year otherwise on the principle of geometrical increase its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product hence as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual with another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct species or with the physical conditions of life it is the doctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food and no prudential restraint from marriage although some species may be now increasing more or less rapidly in numbers all cannot do so for the world would not hold them there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair even slowbreeding man has doubled in twentyfive years and at this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny linnæus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seedsand there is no plant so unproductive as thisand their seedlings next year produced two and so on then in twenty years there would be a million plants the elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old and goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of young in this interval if this be so at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants descended from the first pair but we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations namely the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world if the statements of the rate of increase of slowbreeding cattle and horses in southamerica and latterly in australia had not been well authenticated they would have been quite incredible so it is with plants cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of la plata clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from europe and there are plants which now range in india as i hear from dr falconer from cape comorin to the himalaya which have been imported from america since its discovery in such cases and endless instances could be given no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree the obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed in such cases the geometrical ratio of increase the result of which never fails to be surprising simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes in a state of nature almost every plant produces seed and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually
