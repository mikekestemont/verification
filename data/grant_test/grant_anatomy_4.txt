cetacea it is bounded before by very large orbits separated from each other only by a thin membranous partition or by a thin plate of the sphenoid bone and the bones which form it are anchylosed together so that all traces of the coronal sagittal lamdoidal squamous and other su tures have here disappeared as seen in the skull of the golden eagle falco fulvus fig the occipital a the parietal b the frontal e and the temporal bones are for the most part thin diaphanous smooth externally and internally like the surface of the cere bral hemisphere and embrace a large lobed cerebellum large optic lobes and smooth hemispheres of the brain which taper forwards to the ethmoid bone the nasal and the superior maxillary bones g are moveable on the frontals sometimes by a distinct articulation as in the parrots and cockatoos but most generally by means of the thin flexible condition of these bones at their line of junction and by this the gape of birds is widened to take in or seize bulky objects which their toothless jaws and the form of their hands do not enable them to subdivide the basilar part of the occipital bone is short from the shortness of the cranical cavity as in reptiles amphibia and cetacea and it extends backwards in the form of a single round prominent con dyle by which greater extent of rotation is afforded to the head on the neck the body of the sphenoid is lengthened as in the inferior vertebrata and the two pterygoid bones still remain permanently detached extending laterally to the loose tympanic bones the tympanic element of the temporal bone or the os quadratum is here freely move able as in fishes amphibia and most sauria it sends downwards a convex prominent articular surface for the attachment of the lower jaw and is likewise attached to the long slender malar bone n which forms the inferior boun dary of the orbit by which attachment it is enabled to push forwards and upwards the superior maxiuary and thus widen the mouth the palatine bones are long large and detached leaving a wide fissure between them but the in termaxillaries are anchylosed to each other and to the superior jaw bones which are also united to each other on the anterior part of the orbits the large lachrymal bones e and the small superciliary bones d are detached especially in the rapacious birds and notwithstanding the wide openings of the nostrils externally the turbinated la minee are small soft and cartilaginous the olfactory nerves are transmitted through the back part of the large orbits to the nose there being no perforation for these nerves in the thin cancellated structure of the ethmoid and sphenoid bones separating the orbits and here filled with air the diploe of the cranium which is largely developed in noc turnal birds as owls is filled with air like the bones of the trunk and of the extremities which is admitted through the eustachean tube and the cavity of the tympanum so that it encreases the intensity of sounds and the dimensions of the organs of hearing no parts of the skeleton vary so much in birds as the upper and lower jaws according to the kind of food on which the different species subsist and their modifications are therefore intimately connected with the general forms of the skeleton and the living habits of the species the tipper bill is long and hooked in fishing birds shorter in vultures and still shorter in eagles and hawks the jaws are long straight tapering and pointed in herons and storks shorter and slender in woodpeckers and still more slender and pointed in insectivorous singing birds they are long and curved in the ibises and curlews and humming birds short conical and strong in the gallin aceous and granivorous birds and still shorter and stronger in the parrots and cockatoos to break the hard nuts on which they feed they are flat and depressed and generally with serrated margins in the mallards and ducks and swans flatter in the spoonbills and still broader in the pelicans with these forms of the bills and jaws correspond especially the forms of the digestive organs and the claws of the feet as the analogous parts correspond with the forms of the teeth in quadrupeds from the length and varied uses of the tongue in birds the elements of the os hyoides are much extended longitu dinally especially its cornua or ceratohyal portions which are often extended so far backwards that they rise upwards behind the occipital bone and arch forwards over the skull the lingual portions of the os hyoides the basihyal and the glossohyal elements are also lengthened like the tongue and the whole face of these animals there are in birds as in the inferior vertebrated classes and as in some of the mammalia false ribs anterior as well as posterior to the true ribs the ribs are here broad and compressed securely articulated to the vertebrae by their long head arid long tubercle and they have generauy a process extending up wards and backwards from their posterior margin especially those placed towards the middle of the trunk at their vertebral extremity the ribs are compressed from before backwards so as to present their sharp edge to the cavity of the trunk and at their sternal end they are compressed in the opposite direction so as to present their broad con cave surface to the interior of the body the sternal ex tremities of the true ribs are united by cartilage to the ends of the sternal ribs or ossified sternocostal cartilages and it is at this articulation that the most extensive motions take place during respiration the broad and thick anterior ends of the sternal ribs are received into deep articular cavities on the sides of the sternum and principally of the hyosternal portions of that bone and they move freely and securely in these sternal cavities the sternum in birds as in chelonia covers the greater part of the anterior surface of the trunk and presents excepting in the strutheous birds an elevated median longitudinal external crest which greatly extends the surface for the attachment of the pectoral muscles its elements are anchylosed together like those of the cranium and pelvis in the adult but at an early period the rudiments of nine elements can be detected in its composition which are generally disposed as repre sented in that of the peacock pavo cristatus fig although they vary much in their relative development in different species the two epi sternal pieces are small compressed anchylosed portions which rise fig upwards between the two coracoid bones c y behind the united clavicles and are ossified to the upper edge of the large and long entosternal element o which is the largest element of the sternum and that which has to sustain almost the entire force of the pectoral muscles during flight the entosternal piece o forms the crest of the sternum which is hollow and open above in many aquatic birds to admit a turn of the trachea and is thick and solid in the strong est rapacious birds it admits air into its interior by aper tures on its inner and upper part and it receives the arti cular surfaces of the two coracoid bones c y at its upper edge the two lateral portions m which give attachment to the sternal ribs s s are the hyosternal elements which are very large in the ostrich extending downwards and backwards from the posterior margin of the hyosternal element m is a long narrow bone generally bifurcated in the gallinaceous birds n which is analogous to the hypo sternal portion of this bone in the chelonian reptiles it is more extensively developed in the water birds and most of all in the raptorial species where it forms a continuous piece with the lower end of the entosternal the small tapering terminal cartilage of the sternum continued from the posterior end of the entosternal portion o is com posed of the two xiphisternal elements q analagous to the xiphoid cartilage of the human sternum the scapular arch is very strong in birds to form a solid resisting fulcrum for the powerful movements of the humerus and the mag nitude and strength of these bones corresponds in the dif ferent species with the power of flight or the resistance they have to oppose to the pectoral muscles on the one side and the branchial on the other the scapulae fig a a are long curved compressed bones extending along the back on each side of the dorsal vertebrae they become more narrow and rounded as they approach the glenoid cavity where they suddenly expand to enlarge that cavity b and they are partially anchylosed at that place to the large and strong cora coid bones c k the two coracoid bones k k y extend from the articular cavity c for the head of the humerus downwards and inwards to rest their broad expanded base i in a deep groove on each side of the anterior margin of the entosternal bone these coracoid bones almost alone resist the approximation of the humeri on the median plane and their descent in the direction of the pectoralis major on each side and they have generally more than double the thickness and strength of the scapulae the two clavicles d d descend converging from the upper or humeral ends of the coracoid bones c and they are anchylosed together at their lower ends e where they commonly present a flat compressed prominence connected by cartilage by tendinous expansions or sometimes by anchylosis with the anterior projecting point of the crest of the sternum g the clavicles are very thick and strong and meet at an obtuse rounded angle in the most powerful of the rapacious birds and are long thin and slender and meet at an acute angle in the gallinaceous and other birds of feeble flight in the ostrich the clavicles are very small and short and disunited on the median plane as in mammalia in the arm of the bird there is a great development of the proximate bones which by their magnitude and strength are best able to withstand the re sistance to which they are so frequently opposed while the more delicate and the more distant bones of the hand are few and less perfectly developed the humerus fig e has a broad compressed and curved head the large articular surface of which plays freely in the shallow glenoid cavity formed by the scapular and coracoid bones in the con cavity at the back part of the head of the humerus are the large apertures by which the air from the axillary cells gains admission into the capacious interior cavity of this bone the distal extremity of the humerus is curved forwards and presents a broad articular surface with a double condyle on which chiefly rotates the large ulna fig h the radius being a more slender bone the radius and the ulna are so articulated as to resist pronation and supination of the hand these motions being partially admitted at the head of the humerus the arm of the bird is fixed in a state of pronation the position best suited to strike the air with effect and the hand moves upon the arm not in the common mode of flexion and extension but by abduction and adduction at the ex tremity of the radius fig and the ulna b there are two carpal bones c which are succeeded by a single long meta carpal bone y composed of three pieces an chylosed together one of these pieces e on the radial side of the hand is very short and supports the single small phalanx of the radial or fore finger h the middle metacarpal piece is by much the largest and supports at its extremity generally three phalanges of the middle finger k i m the last of which is very short and slender the first phalanx k of the middle finger has a flat compressed form like the metacarpal bone at the ulnar side of the distal termination of the metacar pal bone is a small single phalanx of the outer or little finger i which is more immediately connected with the exterior slender portion g of the metacarpal bone when in a state of rest the hand of the bird is folded along the exterior edge of the ulna and the large primary feathers are thus extended along the sides of the trunk to the tail these fingers appear to be the analogues of the three middle fingers of the human hand and there is sometimes a single phalanx covered with a spur on the radial side of these three fingers of the hand of the bird the bones of the pelvis though anchylosed into a single piece consist of the ordinary three elements on each side as seen in that of the wild swan fig the two iliac bones a still extend forwards and backwards from the cotyloid cavity along the sides of the sacrum as in the saurian reptiles and as they are anchylosed to that bone the sacroiliac articulation is here of great extent and secu rity the iliac bones anchylose behind with the two ischia b and the sacrosciatic notch of mammalia is converted into a fora men but in the os trich it is a notch open behind as in most quad rupeds the ossa ischii are anchylosed at the cotyloid cavity with the pubic bones c and the three pelvic bones enter into the composition of that cavity for the head of the femur as in other classes the pelvic bones are lengthened backwards and taper downwards thin and elastic to the anterior part of the pubis where the two pubic bones d d are separate and free at the symphysis excepting in the ostrich where they are united by sychon drosis as in mammalia the obturator foramen i has here a long and narrow form corresponding with the length ened form of all the bones of the pelvis the pubic bones are here free and elastic at their anterior terminations d d that they may be susceptible of the necessary dilation when the large brittle and inflexible eggs are passing out through the cloaca and also to afford the necessary support to the contents of the pelvis the cotyloid cavities fig are generally complete foramina without an interior osseous septum and they are placed far forwards upon the pelvis in order to be more under the centre of gravity to poise alone the entire trunk the posterior extremities having more of the ordinary use of these members in other animals than the anterior have their osseous elements constructed more according to the normal character and number of these parts in other vertebrated classes the head of the femur is small short and rounded with a very short cervix and projects at a right angle a little lower than the trochanter major which here forms an extensive arch from before backwards the femur fig v in birds is generally very short and strong compared with the succeeding bones of the leg even in the longlegged grallatores and the running birds the air is admitted into this hollow bone by a large aperture on the fore part of the trochanter major between the two prominent sharp condyles of the femur and the upper end of the long tibia is placed the patella as in quadrupeds at the upper and outer part of this long and strong tibia fig w is a small imperfectly formed fibula thin tapering and anchylosed to the tibia at its lower part and separate above sometimes it is separate throughout the lower part of the tibia presents a broad expanded articular sur face for the succeeding long bone of the metatarsus which is single like the metacarpal bone of the hand there is a small tarsal bone in the ostrich which thus leads to the structure of this part in the lowest ruminantia the tibia and the metatarsal bone are long in most birds but especially in the wading birds as cranes and storks the metatarsal bone fig has two articular depressions at its upper part for the two inferior condyles of the tibia and at its lower end it commonly pre sents three pulleylike articular prominences b for the attachment of the three toes which are directed forwards it resembles that of the jerboa among the rodentia there is generally at the inner and back part of this bone another very small meta tarsal bone for the attachment of the toe which is directed backwards the outer toe of birds has five phalanges d the second has four phalanges e the third has three the inner toe directed backwards has two phalanges ff and the spur seen in the male of many gallinaceous birds is supported by a single osseous phalanx where there are only three toes as in the rhea and emu and cas sowary the inner toe has three phalanges and the outer still five and in the ostrich where there are only two toes the inner toe has four phalanges and the outer five as in other birds so that the toes are here deficient on the inner and not on the outer side of the foot where the number of the phalanges remains uniformly the same in woodpeckers parrots cockatoos and other zygodactylous birds the outer and the inner toes are both directed backwards the better to assist in climbing and consequently one of these has five phalanges and the other only two xxiii mammalia the bones of mammalia are inter mediate in density and compactness of texture and in the extent of their anchylosis between those of birds and those of reptiles they have generally thick and solid parietes traversed by numerous sutures which have disappeared in birds and in the interior of the long bones are large cavities filled with marrow which in birds are filled with air and in reptiles with a cancellated structure the most imperfect forms of the skeleton are presented by the ceta ceous mammalia where the vertebral column as in fishes is the chief organ of progressive motion and almost alone developed they have no sacrum nor pelvic extremities and their cervical vertebrae are more or less anchylosed to gether their long bones are almost in the condition of those of reptiles filled with a loose internal cancellated structure containing a thin serous or oily marrow and all their bones have a coarse fibrous structure compared with those of land mammalia the head is still extended in a straight line with the vertebral column the arms are con structed for swimming and the tail is expanded horizon tally for the vertical movements of the body required by their aerial respiration as seen in the skeleton of the por poise fig the bodies of the vertebrae terminate in flat surfaces united to each other by an elastic fibrocartila ginous interposed substance which admits of the necessary movements by means of its compressibility the terminal flat portions of the bodies of the vertebra remain long se parate as detached pieces in these animals the cervical vertebrae are sometimes all anchylosed together and in the herbivorous cetacea where the neck is longer and more moveable ah the cervical vertebrse are larger and detached from each other in the preserved skeletons of the laman tine there are but six cervical vertebrse the spinous pro cesses extending upwards from the dorsal and coccygeal vertebrae h h h are here long and strong and often sup port a cartilaginous hunch upon the back in form of a ver tical fin i and inferior spinous processes are developed below the coccygeal vertebrae for the protection of the great bloodvessels the transverse processes are also long for the attachment of powerful muscles and they limit the ex tent of lateral motion in the column many of the last coccygeal vertebrae u y have only their round bodies developed and admit of free and extensive motion in every direction the anterior part of the thorax is the most fixed to give at tachment to the powerful muscles of the neck and of the arms and the ribs are there attached both to the bodies and to the transverse processes of the vertebrae but on the pos terior part of the thorax where there is greater freedom of motion the ribs are attached only to the ends of the long transverse processes there are no bones extending into the finlike cartilaginous hunch i upon the back nor into the lateral cartilaginous expansions of the tail v as we find in these parts in fishes the sternum is very short and confined to the anterior ribs and the sternal ribs are gene rally ossified as in many other quadrupeds and in birds and in many reptiles although there are no legs we always find here two lengthened slender pelvic bones unconnected with the rest of the skeleton and having the riblike form of the iliac bones of fishes and amphibia the head is most lengthened straight and fishlike in the piscivorous cetacea as the porpoise fig where the face is chiefly composed of the long maxillary and inter maxillary bones and the vomer which is extended between them the small nasal bones are placed far back wards upon the forehead behind the nasal apertures and behind them is the narrow band of the frontal bone which is in contact with the occipital from the parietals being confined to the temporal region of the head from the great extent and the vertical position of the occipital bone and the extension of the maxillary bones upon the forehead the cranium is here generally small compared with the face and is much extended transversely great extent of surface for muscular attachment is thus given to the back part of the head and great development to the jaws in front for pre hension the teeth like those of fishes and reptiles are adapted for prehension and not for mastication they are similar in form conical bent and placed alternately in the opposite jaws in the cachalots they are present only in the lower jaws which are very narrow and in contact with each other throughout the greater part of their course and thus are opposed only to the middle part of the roof of the mouth in the foetus of the balsena there are teeth in the lower jaws which soon entirely disappear and the alveolar margin of the upper jaws are occupied with vertical long thin horny laminae which are fimbriated on their inner edges and by straining the water they collect the small floating animals on which the whales feed the malar bone forms the lower boundary of their very small orbit f and is here a remarkably thin slender and curved bone com pared with the massive malar bone of the herbivorous spe cies which require a more powerful masseter for mastication the petrous and tympanic portions of the temporal bone though anchylosed together are connected only by cartilage to the other bones of the skull the ethmoid bone presents no cribriform plate and the infraorbitary foramen is divided into a series of small apertures extending forwards along the upper jawbones the right side of the head is generally more developed than the other and the nostrils are inclined thus to the left side the arms of these cetacea are moved in a piece as fins and the articulations of the several bones especially of the hand are very imperfectly formed there is no clavicle but the great expansion of the scapula fig n presents a large surface for the powerful muscles of the humerus by which the arm is chiefly moved the suc ceeding bones being scarcely moveable on each other in the living state the humerus o has a large round head but is compressed at its lower end like that of a turtle and the same compressed form is seen in the radius p and the ulna q and in the detached round bones of the carpus r the metacarpus and the phalanges of the five fingers t in the herbivorous cetacea as in the dugong fig we find a much nearer approach in many parts of the skeleton to the ordinary condition of these parts in the land quad rupeds than in the piscivorous tribes especially in the forms of the jaws and teeth in the cervical vertebra and in the whole bones of the arms the cervical vertebrae a are here detached and moveable on each other and the neck is thus longer and more flexible the occipital bone rises to a much less extent upon the cranium and its ele ments like those of most of the other bones remain long disunited the cranical cavity is smaller considerably than in the former group all the sutures of the cranium re main very loose and the petrous and tympanic portions of the temporal bone are permanently detached from the squa mous as in the other cetacea the frontals are divided by a continuation of the sagittal suture the malar or jugal bones are here of great size and strength the jaws are of great depth for the long molares with flat crowns adapted to their vegetable food and the intermaxillary bones g are of great size for the long and large incisors h which they contain the lachrymal bone forms a small portion of the margin of the orbit and is interposed between the anterior end of the jugal bone and the malar process of the frontal the muzzle is straight in the predaceous tribes fig and thus directed to the prey which floats or swims in the water but in the herbivorous cetacea it is bent down to the fuci which are attached to the bottom of the sea as the neck is here more lengthened and moveable the trunk is more fixed in its condition by the development of the sternum and of more numerous and larger ribs the pelvic arch is more complete and the inferior spinous processes of the coccygeal vertebrae are larger and stronger the whole bones of the arms are constructed more according to their normal forms in the land mammalia and these animals are able to clamber upon rocks on the sea shore like seals and walruses and to ma nipulate their young while suckling at their pectoral mammae the scapula o is more narrow and lengthened the hu merus q is longer and more cylindrical than in the blow ing cetacea and the radius and ulna r have a more lengthened and rounded form and admit of more extensive motion at both extremities the forms and articulations are more complete and admit of freer motion in all the bones of the carpus s and metacarpus and in the pha langes of the fingers u so that the hands possess much more prehensile power in the herbivorous than in the pisci vorous cetacea the skeletons of ruminating quadrupeds still present many marks of an inferior grade of development when compared with carnivorous and higher orders of mammalia especially in the small size of the cranial cavity compared with the face in the deficiency of teeth in the jaws in the want of clavicles and in the imperfect condition of the arms and legs and of the hands and feet as seen in the skeleton of the fossil elk fig their frontal bone which ge nerally develops horns from its tuberosities is divided by a longitudinal suture and the parietals are anchylosed toge ther to consolidate the skull behind the tuberosities of the frontal bones in the males of most genera of this order extend upwards into permanent processes of a loose can cellated structure which are covered with permanent horny and extravascular sheaths as in antelopes sheep goats and oxen in the deers the antlers are deciduous organized osseous processes continued from the same tuberosities of the frontal bones with thick dense and very compact pa rieties and a softer internal core passing through all the branches these deciduous horns which are diverticula of the blood at stated seasons and intimately connected in their development with the condition of the genital system are annually cast and renewed each successive pair being larger and more complex in form than the preceding there are permanent rudimentary osseous horns in the giraffe together with a median frontal eminence like that on the frontal bone of the twohorned rhinoceros but there are no horns in the camels dromedaries lamas pacas and muskdeers where there are canine teeth and they are wanting in the females of most ruminantia the orbits are thrown to the sides of the head by the great development of the frontal bones which are chiefly occupied with air from the large sinuses they communicate with the tem poral fosse but have a complete osseous margin by the extension downwards of the malar process of the frontal to the jugal bone the lachrymal bone extends downwards over the face to assist in lengthening the head the alveolar portions of the jaws are deep for the long malar teeth and the broad nasal bones cover a large and long nasal cavity the turbinated bones are of great size the malar bone is prolonged over the face the zygomatic arch is very small and has the coracoid process of the lower jaw extended to a great height through it which limits the lateral motion of the lower jaw during mastication the long slender inter maxillary bones are generally destitute of teeth the malar teeth with oblique crowns have the layers of enamel directed longitudinally the motion of the lower jaw being from side to side the lower jaw being much narrower than the upper the lateral motion is required to bring the teeth into apposition for mastication and the glenoid and condyloid surfaces are therefore flat to admit of this extensive motion the cervical vertebrae fig c are of a lengthened form with short processes to give length and mobility to the neck and the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae c are long for the attachment and support of the long neck and often weighty head the ribs extend over a great part of the trunk z and the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae are of great length to assist in the support of the heavy abdominal viscera the pelvis p is lengthened backwards the sacroiliac articulation n is more or less oblique to give greater elasticity to the movements of the legs and the coccygeal vertebrae o are numerous and highly moveable the tail being generally employed as a hand to brush away insects from the surface of the body the anterior part of the thorax destitute of clavicles is so com pressed that several of the first pairs of ribs are almost straight by which the arms are approximated and brought more nearly under the centre of gravity of the heavy trunk from which they would have been thrown out and endangered by the interposition of clavicles the elements of the sternum y placed in a line are extended longitudinally like the ribbed part of the trunk and are generally narrow and compressed laterally the long narrow scapulae e have scarcely the rudiments of the acromion and coracoid processes developed the humerus and the femur q are generally short and strong bones much inclined from the vertical position es pecially in the lighter and nimbler forms of this order the secure articulations of the long radius h and tibia s admit of free flexion and extension but are fixed in a state of pronation the imperfect ulna is anchylosed below to the back part of the radius and consists chiefly of an elon gated olecranon g to secure the elbow joint and afford a strong attachment to the extensor muscles of the arm at the lower end of the radius are found the four usual small carpal bones of the first row separate and the four of the second row are here generally anchylosed into two pieces i which form the articulation with the long single metacarpal bone k this broad metacarpal like the compressed metatarsal bone consisted in the foetus of two separate bones and it retains in the adult state longitudinal median grooves before and behind which mark the line of original separation there are often likewise the slender rudiments of two other meta carpal and two metatarsal bones seen one on each side of these long anchylosed bones of the metacarpus k and metatarsus t and the rudiments of two corresponding toes are found at the sides of all the feet there are two long pulleylike articular condyles at the lower end of the metacarpal bone and there are three phalanges on each of the two toes prolonged to the ground the trochanter major is large and elevated on the strong and short femur q the long and strong tibia s forms the whole articulation with the femur and with the astragulus u and fibula forms only a small splint the calcaneum extends upwards in the elevated heel like the olcranon at the elbow besides the astragulus and calcaneum there are generally two cuneiform bones and a compound cuboscaphoid bone in the tarsus of ruminantia but there is one more bone in the camel as in the tarsus of the solidungulous pachyderma the long anchylosed compound metatarsal bone v is more compressed and narrow than the corresponding broad and flattened metacarpal of the hand and has attached to its inferior pulleylike articular processes two toes lm prolonged to the ground which like the fingers of the hands have three phalanges in each great elasticity is given to the extremities in the ruminating quadrupeds by the alternately inclined direction of most of the bones and great security is given to the articulations by the pulleylike form of nearly all the joints the skeletons of the pachyderma like those of rumi nating quadrupeds have no clavicles and have the jaws and teeth adapted for vegetable food the articulations are con structed generally for limited slow and secure movements and the bones are more strong and massive in their pro portions the nearest approach to the ruminating form of the skeleton is that of the solidungulous quadrupeds where we observe as in the camels three kinds of teeth in the jaws the jaws and face are there lengthened to reach the turf and the upper and lower maxillary bones are of great depth to lodge the long prismatic quadrangular molar teeth the cranial cavity is small as in all the pachyderma and the orbits are surrounded with an osseous ring as in the ruminantia the transverse ridge of the occipital bone is much elevated for the attachment of the strong muscles and ligaments of the neck by the great development of the interposed bones the orbits are thrown to the extreme lateral points of the head and directed to the sides the ethmoid bone presents internally two large and deep fossae for the olfactory tubercles and the turbinated bones pre sent a very extensive surface for the distribution of the first pair of nerves in their long neck their long spinous pro cesses of the dorsal vertebrae the compressed form of the tho rax the lengthened form of the bones of the scapular and pelvic arches and of their extremities they more approach to the ruminantia than to the ordinary short and massive forms of the pachyderma and the anchylosis which extends in the ruminating quadrupeds only through the inferior row of the carpal and tarsal and through the metacarpal and meta tarsal bones is here continued downwards through the pha langes of the two middle fingers and toes to the extremity of the hands and feet in most of the ordinary pachyderma as the pecari the babyrussa the tapir the hippopotamus and the rhinoceros the back part of the skull presents an elevated transverse ridge and a broad surface of attachment for the muscles and liga ments of their heavy head and strong neck the head being sometimes employed in digging as in the hog tribe or to support a strong instrument of defence as in the rhino ceros or being proportionally large and weighty as in the hippopotamus the air is admitted from the frontal sinuses over a large portion of the diploe in the babyrussae and other animals of the hog tribe to extend the external sur face without adding to the weight of the head as we see to a much greater extent in the huge head of the elephant all the processes of the cervical vertebrse are here more strongly developed than in the long flexible neck of the ru minantia and the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrse are lengthened and strong and generally terminated by round tubercles the scapula is generally broader at its vertebral margin and the strong pelvic arch is more vertical in its direction the extremities are generally shorter and more massive and the separate bones more completely formed than in the former groups of quadrupeds the ulna and the fibula being developed throughout and four toes at least generally reaching the ground on all the extremities as the kind of vegetable food varies much more here than in the ruminating quadrupeds there is a greater diversity in the forms of the teeth and of the jaws and of many other parts of the skeleton the general forms and proportions of the bones most common in the ordinary pachyderma are seen in the massive skeleton of the rhinoceros fig where the head and neck are more lengthened than in the proboscidian tribe and the trunk is almost en tirely encompassed by large and broad ribs the fore part of the head presents an arched appearance from the eleva tion of the anchylosed nasal bones a for the support of the horn and the intermaxillaries are very slender and short and contain each a single incisor tooth the orbits e are quite continuous with the temporal fosse as in the tapir but in the hippopotamus they are surrounded with a bony margin as in the solidungula the inferior molar teeth are here remarkably narrow when compared with the broad cubical crowns of those of the upper jaws and the two long conical inferior incisors c project forwards like those of a hippopotamus the great elevation of the oc cipital bone d the great size of all the processes of the cervical vertebrae g and the magnitude of the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae indicate the force with which the head is moved and the powerful offensive instru ments which it supports in the twohorned species the anterior part of the frontal bone is raised like the nasal bones into an arch for the support of the posterior horn the infraorbitary foramen is of great size for the nerves of the large expanded upper lip like that of the elephant for the nerves of the proboscis the spinous processes continue large and strong on the lumbar and even the sacral vertebrae and the sacroiliac articulation is nearly vertical to that of the femur with the cotyloid cavity as in many of the other ponderous skeletons of pachy derma the spine of the scapula i arches backwards over the infraspinati muscles as in the elephant the ulna and the fibula are developed and distinct throughout their whole extent and the olecranon of the arm like the patella of the leg is of great size as are the muscular processes of all the bones of the extremities the iliac bones q are expanded transversely the tuberosities of the ischia ex tend outwards and the cotyloid cavities are directed down wards three toes are continued to the ground before and behind consisting each of three phalanges the two first of these phalanges have a broad cubical form and the last is remarkable for its rough irregular form and its extension transversely the terminal phalanx of the middle toe on all the feet is elongated transversely on both sides but in the other toes it is elongated only on one side that most remote from the middle toe so that ample support is afforded to the broad hoofs and a broad base for the pon derous carcase of this powerful quadruped the carcase being still more ponderous in the elephants the scapular and pelvic arches and the whole extremities are more vertical in their direction and the scapular and iliac bones are of great breadth the heavy molar teeth and the large tusks and the large proboscis give so much weight to the head that the neck in these proboscidian animals is very short and the external surface of the cranium is greatly extended for muscular and ligamentous attachments with out adding to the weight of the head by the vertical cells of the diploe being filled with air admitted through the eustachian tubes from the strong attrition to which the molar teeth of the elephants are subjected they are com posed of numerous thick transverse plates of enamel en closing the osseous portions and united together by an en veloping crusta petrosa and they are successively worn down to their base and replaced by new teeth from behind for eight or nine times during the life of the animals while the long tusks are renewed but once the base of the lower jaw projects more than the human in the monotrematous animals the skull is thin smooth and diaphanous and with a lengthened toothless muzzle as in birds as we see in the skeleton of the ornithorhyncus fig where there are only two horny thin crowns of molar teeth a at the back part and on each side of the two jaws their intermaxillary bones converge at their free anterior extremities there is a median longitudinal osseous crest in the ornithorhynchus extending along the interior of the occi pital and parietal bones and the occipital foramen d is prolonged upwards narrow in a vertical direction the scapula especially in the ornithorhyncus is lengthened and curved backwards like that of a bird and as also in that oviparous class the large coracoid bones reach and unite with the sternum the clavicles m meet and are anchylosed together in front and the sternal appendices are ossified the ribs encompass a large proportion of the trunk and long marsupial bones are extended forwards from the margin of the pubic bones the long arms and legs and the extended feet of the ornithorhyncus suit it for its aquatic life while the stronger extremities and short feet of the echidna are suited for digging in the ground in many of the edentata the upper and lower jaws are long narrow curved and toothless as in birds and the trunk as in the armadillos is surrounded with very broad ribs the pubic bones also are often lengthened backwards and meet at a very narrow symphesis and there is generally a sacro sciatic foramen as we find in birds in place of the ordinary sacrosciatic notch of quadrupeds in the sloths there are false ribs anterior to the true ribs as well as behind them as we observe in most of the oviparous vertebrata and the zygomatic arch is open in some of the anteaters as the myrmecophaga jubata from the longitudinal movement of the lower jaw in the rodentia its condyles are extended longitudinally and the layers of enamel are disposed trans versely in the molar teeth their two chiselshaped incisors above and below are kept sharp by means of the thin layer of very dense enamel which coats their anterior surface and the broad crowns of their molares are kept rough by the unequal densities of the layers of enamel and of osseous substance which compose them as the cerebral hemis pheres are destitute of convolutions the surfaces of the skull are thin smooth and often diaphanous as in birds and the squamous portion of the temporal bone generally remains long separate from the other elements of that bone the mastoid bone generally forms a large bulla communi cating with the tympanum as in the carnivorous quadrupeds and the orbit is here also continuous with the temporal fossa the intermaxillary and the nasal bones are of great size the zygomatic arch has its convexity directed down wards and the palatine holes are of great size as in birds the clavicle is sometimes complete and strong and in many it is developed only in its central part the sacrum and the iliac bones are long and the pelvis is extended backwards as in many edentulous quadrupeds and birds although the radius and the ulna are free on the arms the fibula is very imperfect and is anchylosed to the tibia on the posterior extremities notwithstanding the differences observed in the skeletons of the different kinds of marsupial quadrupeds they agree in the possession of two triangular lengthened marsupial bones articulated moveably to the anterior margin of the pubes and extending forwards behind the pouch and the mammary glands and in contact with the recti muscles of the abdomen the skeletons of carnivorous quadrupeds have gene rally the bones of a more compact and dense texture combining lightness with strength in their forms and secure yet freely moveable in their articulations which corresponds with their great muscular development with the extent of their respiratory system with the increased energy of all their functions and with their living wants and in stincts from their great cerebral and intellectual develop ment their cranial cavity is comparatively large and to give strength to their jaws their face is generally short and broad as seen in these skulls of the bengal tiger felis tigris fig a b the transverse occipital ridge is re markably high and prominent for the strong muscles of the neck as also the longitudinal ridge b b extending forwards along the occipital and parietal bones which alone separates the the two large temporal muscles from each other the sides of the cranium often assume a compressed form especially where the temporal muscles are of great force as in the hyaena and in old carnivora where many of the cranial sutures also disappear the mastoid process a r forms a large cavity or bulla communicating with the tympanum and enlarging the organ of hearing in these as in other nocturnal animals the zygomatic arch e e is of great magnitude and strength and is convex above the temporal fossse are continuous with the orbits from the de ficiency of the frontal b and the malar bone b a behind the orbits and the zygomatic process b c d extends laterally at a right angle from the squamous por tion a c of the temporal in order to form a long trans verse glenoid cavity for the transverse articular condyle a of the lower jaw the parietal bones b b early anchylose in the animals of this order so as to resist the tearing action of the temporal muscles which have a great surface for inser tion on the large coronoid process a t which forms the entire ramus of the lower jaw there is a strong ossified tentorium extending inwards between the brain and cerebel lum to protect these delicate organs from the effects of their leaping and bounding movements the infraorbitary fora men is large for the nerves of the upper part of the face and the upper part of the nasal cavity is enlarged for the ethmoid and turbinated bones by the great breadth of the nasal process k k of the superior maxillary bone and of the nasal bones z i the intermaxillaries o o contain each three teeth the outer of which are the largest and the canine teeth w above and below are large conical curved and insert ed in very deep alveoli m m the large transverse condyle a of the lower jaw is little raised above the base and is secured in a very deep glenoid cavity of the temporal bone that the jaws and teeth may meet with great precision especially the molar teeth which have sharp cutting crowns a u v w directed longitudinally and entirely covered with a very dense and thick layer of enamel the anterior small detached molar teeth w behind the canine n y are the false molar es the larger prominent cutting molar tooth with a tubercle at the interior of its base is the carnivorous tooth a u and the flat broadcrowned tuberculated teeth which are more or less developed behind these are the tuberculated molares a a of which there is only a very small one in the feline carnivora the lachrymal bone is here almost confined to the orbit by the zygomatic arch being carried forwards beneath the orbit and the condyle of the lower jaw being extended backward the masseter muscles act with great force and advantage on the lower jaw their place of insertion being like that also of the temporal considerably anterior to the point of resistance and of rotation the transverse processes of the atlas and the spinous process of the axis are of great length and the processes generally of the cervical vertebrae for the strong muscles of the neck by which they have to tear their food to pieces or to carry their victims to a place of retreat there is great strength with flexibility in all parts of the vertebral column and hence their slender ribs encom pass a smaller portion of the trunk than in the ponderous bodies of the pachyderma but their thoracic cavity is wide and capaceous the lumbar region is extensive and the trans verse processes of the vertebrae are there directed forwards the sacroiliac articulation is very oblique giving greater elasticity to the attachment of the legs to the trunk and the coccygeal vertebras are generally very numerous and moveable the scapula is broad and strong the clavicles imperfect or wanting and the muscular processes of the bones of the arm and forearm are strongly marked above the inner condyle of the humerus fig c is a large oblique foramen through which the ulnar artery passes forwards protected from external pressure as we see also in some of the climbing quadrumana in the soft and flexible hand of the carnivora as in that of the tiger fig a the carpal bones are generally reduced to seven by the anchylosis of the scaphoid and lunar bones a and the succeeding bones of the metacarpus c and the phalanges of the fingers d e present strong and secure articulations the last phalanx on the hands e e as on the feet b e e being directed upwards to d preserve the sharp claws from abrasion the inner toe of the anterior and posterior extremities a d b so imperfectly developed in most of the digitigrade carnivora is generally longer in the plantigrade and the aquatic species in the true insectivorous quadrupeds without wings as the hedgehogs shrews and moles the jaws are more lengthened the canine teeth are often small the molar teeth have broad crowns with an outer and inner row of sharppointed tuber cles to seize and bruise the insect food the scapular arch is strengthened by clavicles the radius and ulna are separate and moveable on each other the rudimentary fibula is anchy losed to the tibia all the feet are plantigrade and pentadacty lous and the toes and claws are strong for scraping and digging the orbit is continuous with the temporal fossa the zygoma tic arch is very slender and straight the infraorbitary foramen large and the articulation of the lower jaw flat there is great mobility in the articulations of the hedgehogs as in other spiny and scaly quadrupeds to allow of their coiling their body into the form of a ball for protection the ante rior portion of the skeleton is more developed than the pos terior in the moles to enable them more easily to burrow and in the cheiroptera to favour their flight through the air the cranial bones the occipital the parietal and the frontal are remarkably extended forwards in the mole compared with the extent of the anterior bones of the face the coronoid process of the lower jaw rises high through the zygomatic arch and the angle of the jaw is prolonged backwards and a little inwards over the mastoid portion of the temporal bone the fore part of the septum of the nose is ossified in this animal as in the hogs to support the nose in digging the spinous process of the axis is large and extended back wards but the succeeding cervical vertebrae are like narrow distant rings almost destitute of spinous and transverse pro cesses to allow the freest motion in this part with safety to the enclosed spinal chord the sternum is extended for wards to a great distance before the first pair of ribs and is carinated like that of a bird to afford an extensive surface of attachment to the large pectoral muscles and for the same reason as well as to lodge large respiratory organs the ribs encompass a widely expanded thoracic cavity the clavicles are very short and strong the scapulae long and narrow the humerus short and widely expanded at both ends the ole cranon of great magnitude and extent the bones of the hand short fixed and strong for rapidly excavating the ground and one of the carpal bones is lengthened and curved forwards to increase the inner surface of this digging instrument the pelvis and the posterior extremities are very small the pelvic bones are anchylosed to the sacrum the pubics are separate in front and the fibula is reduced to a small process of the tibia as in most other digging and burrowing qua drupeds the skeletons of the cheiroptera are constructed for flight and present as in the moles the anterior portion much more developed than the posterior the jaws are lengthened for the reception of numerous broadcrowned sharp tuberculated insectivorous molar teeth the canine teeth are generally long and pointed the intermaxillary bones small and imper fectly ossified the palatine bones separate the zygomatic arch is very feeble and the orbits for their very small eyes are continuous with the temporal fossse as in carnivora the bones of bats are generally light and compact in their texture and some of their ordinary sutures as the sagittal early disappear in the cranium the orbit is surrounded with a complete osseous margin in the pier opus in the rhinolophus the intermaxillaries are small soft and cartilagi nous and contain each but one incisor tooth and in the nycteris these bones are united by a moveable articulation to the upper jawbones like the moveable upper bill of parrots and cockatoos the cervical and lumbar regions of the skeleton admit of free motion and the long iliac bones are often anchylosed to the sacrum as in the feathered tribes the coccygeal vertebrae are often prolonged to support an in ter femoral membrane as in the pteropus and rhinolophus the long pubic bones scarcely meet at the symphesis and the cotyloid cavities are directed obliquely backwards which assists in the retroversion of the feet the scapulae have a broad expanded form the clavicles are long and strong the coracoid process is lengthened and curved downwards and inwards and the fore part of the sternum is often deeply carinated like that of a bird the long cylindrical humerus is succeeded solely by the radius in the forearm the ulna being reduced to its olecranon which often forms a separate moveable patella at the elbow like that of the kneejoint the carpal bones occupy a very small space in the hand and the long fingers are here fixed in a state of extension as they are in the hand of the bird the thumb alone admitting of free flexion and extension the hand of the bats rotates on the carpal end of the radius by a motion of abduction and adduc tion as the wing of the bird so that when folded the little finger lies along the outside of the radius the thumb is not enclosed in the interdigital membrane but is extended for wards free as a prehensile organ for progressive motion or for suspending its body the long slender metacarpal bones and phalanges of the four succeeding fingers support the interdigital membrane and there are often claws on the fore and on the middle finger the small legs are twisted outwards from their commencement in the oblique cotyloid cavities of the open pelvis the femur is of a cylindrical form slender and with a large articular head and a large trochanter minor directed forwards the trochanter major being here turned backwards the fibula is broad at its tarsal extremity but is almost lost before it reaches the upper end of the long slender tibia from the retroverted direction of the cotyloid cavities and of the whole legs the tibia is placed externally and the fibula internally the short bent calcaneum directed inwards has often extending from its tuberosity along the margin of the interfemoral membrane a slender elastic bone which supports that membrane the slender parallel toes directed backwards terminate in long curved sharp prehensile claws by which they most frequently suspend their body in an inverted posi tion the best suited for their launching instantaneously into the air with outspread wings when called by hunger or alarm in the lowest of the quadrumanous animals as the lemurs of madagascar the jaws are still lengthened for numerous insectivorous molar teeth and the skeleton generally is adapted for the horizontal position of the trunk the oc cipital foramen is placed near the posterior margin of the skull the mastoid cells are as large as in carnivorous quad rupeds and although the orbit is here surrounded with an osseous margin it is still continuous behind with the tem poral fossa the cranial cavity however is here capacious and the ordinary sutures of the human cranium continue permanent as in the higher forms of quadrumana the sagittal suture often traverses the frontal bone and the an terior frontals are sometimes seen separate the temporal fossa is small the zygomatic arch feeble the condyles of the lower jaw and their glenoid cavities flat the lachrymal bones extend downwards from the orbits and are perforated on their facial surface and the nasal bones unlike those of higher quadrumana are broad long straight longitudinally and form an expanded arch in their transverse direction as in carnivora and other inferior tribes the ramus of the lower jaw is still very short its condyles are nearly as low as the alveoli of the teeth and the coronoid processes rise high through the zygomatic arches the inferior incisor teeth four in number as in the simise and in man project straight from the lower jaw as those of a kangaroo and this direction is seen also in the stenops the galago and the lichanotus the face and entire head become shorter as we ascend through these genera to the true simiae of the old and new continents in the simiee the lamdoidal the sagit tal the squamous and the coronal sutures advance forwards on the cranium more and more as the cerebral centres and the cranial cavity enlarge and the face becomes proportion ally small as the muzzle shortens the facial angle en creases by the elevation and expansion of the frontal bone and by this shortening of the jaws less space is afforded for numerous molar teeth the
