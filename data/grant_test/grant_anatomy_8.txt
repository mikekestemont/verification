the abdominal cavity ex tended as the ganglionic columns in the succeeding class between the alimentary and respiratory cavities the nervous columns of the conchifera are almost con fined to a suboesophageal position and extend along the inferior or ventral surface of the abdominal cavity above the respiratory sac they are most detached from each other at their anterior part and often continue separate through their whole course the motor or simple co lums which i have generally found more transpa rent and colourless than the ganglionic keep in contact with the sensitive chords but sometimes they occupy a lateral position passing over the sides of the ganglia especially the last pair where the two kinds of nerves are most obvious on opening the respiratory sac of a conch iferous animal as of the common muscle mytilus edulis fig s and throwing aside the branchiae the foot and the pectinated lateral prolongations of the lips we perceive two large white ganglia ab placed on the lower and lateral parts of the mouth resting on the peritoneal covering of the stomach or of the liver which envelopes it and sending upwards and forwards numerous large branches to the lips and neighbouring parts and to the sympathetics two of these branches after encompassing the short oesopha gus often meet above that passage and form a distinct supracesophageal or cerebral ganglion and two other branches passing inwards from the same ganglia beneath the stomach sometimes form another double ganglion on the median plain close to the first suboesophageal pair ab the double nervous columns continue their course back wards from these anterior lateral ganglia running on the same plain along the interior surface of the abdominal cavity to the broad expanded base of the muscular foot where the middle pair of ganglia are placed these ab dominal or pedal ganglia c d are the most variable in size and correspond in their development with the presence or the magnitude of the foot which receives branches from them the columns which connect these two pairs of ganglia are separated from each other on the median plain by a space which varies according to the lateral extension of the trunk in the different species they are generally parallel and near to each other in their course the two symmetrical columns of ganglionic and simple nerves continuing backwards beneath the ovary to the inferior surface of the great adductor muscle of the valves meet with a third pair of infraabdominal ganglia e which are the most approximated to each other and are often united into a single lobed ganglionic mass as in the pecten maximus in this large pecten it is easy to perceive that the motor portion of each of the two converging columns passes laterally over the surface of this large compound ganglion placed on the median plain under the middle of the large adductor muscle of the valves this pair of ganglia e appears to vary in size with the magnitude of the adductor muscle and the extent of the palleal margins and branchke which receive nervous branches from it the columns which pass backwards from the posterior ganglia soon divide into numerous branches which supply this part of the trunk and the largest nerves continued upwards along the adductor muscle from the columns are observed to extend on each side of the rectum to the margins of the mantle and to supply the ciliated and fringed orifices of the abdominal and thoracic cavities and they send large branches to the branchiae the ganglia which are most obvious on first opening the valves of the conchifera are the posterior pair placed on the adductor muscle and these have generally bicmi described and figured by poli as the centre of this system which he mistook for the chyliferous system of these animals the same pair has been uniformly designated and represented by chiaje as the brain of these acephalous niollusca but both these authors have accurately represented their forms and the distribution of their numerous diverging branches these two ganglia are connected by a trans verse band on the posterior adductor muscle of the broad area noa the nerves of which have been minutely traced and represented by poll as extending over the branchiae and the posterior portion of the mantle these posterior ganglia situate on the great adductor muscle and sending forwards branches to the gills are very remote from each other in the avicula they are separate in the mactra as in the mytilusy they are partially joined into a quadrilobate mass in the cardium and the solen they form a single gan glion in the spondylus as in the pecten and they form by their union a transverse thick nervous band on the large abductor of the pinna the first subcesophageal pair of ganglia a b with their numerous anterior branches and their two columns extending backwards to the pos terior ganglia e have been accurately traced and re presented by poli in different species of solen small ganglia are observed in the conchifera as in the tunicata and in the articulated classes on other nerves besides the two great sensitive columns the visceral or sympathetic nerves appear to receive their principal branches from the nerves of the first subcesophageal pair of ganglia as they have been long known to receive their principal trunks from those of the two corresponding lateral ganglia of the stomach in the crustacea from the great development of the organs of the senses and of mastication at the entrance to the oesophagus in the gas teropods their nervous axis is much more concentrated and developed in that situation than it is in the conchifera and from this general advancement of the great nervous cen tres to the head of these animals we commonly observe a proportional diminution in the extent of their two symme trical subventral nervous columns in the short and broad bodies of the gasteropods the symmetrical columns are still generally separated from each other by a variable space along the median plain as in the conchiferous mollusca but as the general form and structure of the animals of this class vary remarkably we find a corresponding diversity in the form and disposition of the great centres of nervous energy in the simple form of the nervous system presented by the carinaria mediterranea fig there is a close analogy with the ordinary disposition of the symmetrical detached nervous columns along the ventral surface of the abdomen in the inhabitants of bivalve shells lobed ganglia g h are observed in this animal at the sides of the oesophagus and a transverse nervous band connecting them and encom passing that passage from this nervous oesophageal ring the two optic nerves pass laterally to the eyes and the tentacular branches pass upwards and forwards to the long slender tentacula e e numerous branches ex tend downwards and laterally to ramify on the muscular parietes of the abdomen and two principal trunks k k ex tending backwards along the ventral surface of the abdomen like the great nervous axis of conchifera meet with a large compound quadrilobate ganglion q behind the stomach and above the diverging muscles of the compressed pinniform foot n o these two subventral detached and converging columns k k extending from the cesophageal collar to the middle or pedal ganglia can be traced backwards from these ganglia along the lower surface q m of the abdominal cavity and beneath the intestine c d to near the caudal extremity of the trunk another branch is described by chiaje as a sympathetic extending directly backwards from the brain or cesophageal collar and spreading on the viscera without passing to the quadrilobate ganglion q numerous branches come off from the periphery of the pedal ganglia q to ramify on the muscles of the foot and the surround ing parts the pedal ganglia q have been regarded as sympathetic but from their whole relations to the rest of the nervous system and from the form and position of the great trunks k k m connected with them they appear more analogous to the symmetrical subventral ganglia of conchifera and of the articulated classes the lateral ganglia of the nervous cesophageal collar are generally the parts from which the two principal nervous chords extend back wards beneath the abdominal viscera in the gasteropods as in the bivalved mollusca as seen in the annexed figure of he nervous system of the aplysia fasciata fig in the aplysia as in many of the higher forms of gasteropods there is a large median supracesophageal ganglion a from which the organs of the senses receive their nerves and from this single superior ganglion a proceed downwards and laterally two nervous bands to connect it with the usual pair of late ral cesophageal ganglia b c two nervous branches likewise proceed downwards and forwards from the cerebral ganglion to form a small anterior collar around the oeso phagus i and an inferior single ganglion ff is seen be neath the muscular bulb of the oesophagus where these branches meet the posterior large nervous collar is com pleted by an inferior transverse band passing between the lateral ganglia b c and beneath the oesophagus i from the lateral cesophageal ganglia b c two nervous trunks d d extend backwards beneath the divisions of the stomach k i m n and along the ventral surface of the abdomen to near the bulb of the aorta t where they meet with a single gan glion e considered from its position its distribution and its attachment to that arterial trunk as a sympathetic ganglion the cerebral ganglion placed above the oesophagus and connected through the lateral ganglia b c with these two longitudinal columns has a quadrangular form a reddish brown colour and is enclosed in a tough cranial membranous capsule immediately above the posterior end of the bulb of the oesophagus the same reddish coloured nucleus and granular structure are seen in all the ganglia of the aplysia and from the toughness of the neurilematous covering of the ganglia and nerves they can be easily injected like vessels as in most other molluscous animals the lateral ganglia b c have each a trilobate form and the nervous bands which connect them with the brain have a distinct appear ance of separate component columns there are two fila ments which proceed backwards from these lateral ganglia like the origins of the sympathetics of crustacea and which here form by their union an arch around the trunk of the aorta the anterior bilobate suboesophageal ganglion g gives off eight nerves to the oesophagus the salivary glands and the muscles of the mouth the two lateral ganglia are con nected together by a broad nervous band which passes be low the oesophagus and completes the posterior ring around that passage the muscles of the head the superior tenta cula and the small eyes receive their nerves from the cere bral ganglion a the optic is a branch from the large ten tacular nerve on each side the nerves from the lateral ganglia are spread chiefly on the muscular parietes of the trunk and those from the aortic ganglion e are observed ramifying on the liver the intestines the branchiae and the generative organs the aorta receives a minute branch from the two anastomosing filaments of the lateral ganglia which embrace it and a second ganglion almost impercepti ble is found on one of the branches proceeding from the great abdominal sympathetic ganglion the sympathetic ganglia are also distinct in the scylltea the glaucus and many other small naked gasteropods the nervous oesophageal ring of the haliotis has two lateral ganglia which supply nerves to the tentacula the pedunculated eyes and other parts of the head and presents below the oesophagus a large median ganglion from which a series of long nerves extend backwards along the inferior surface of the abdomen as in the carinaria and the same plan of distribution is seen in the nervous system of the patella and many similar forms in the bulla lignaria fig there is a small lobed gan glion anterior to the usual cephalic ring e and which is si tuate below the bulb d of the oesophagus a behind the salivary glands b b and anterior to the insertions of the diverging muscular bands c c of the bulb of the oesopha gus this ganglion is situate like the small anterior infra cesophageal ganglion of the aplysia the cephalic ring e e enveloping the oesophagus behind this single ganglion has two large trilobate ganglia at its sides which send numerous branches to the surrounding muscular parts and two long branches a a extend backwards from them along the sides of the abdomen to two symmetrical subventral ganglia i i placed above the muscular foot behind these are two sympathetic ganglia k which send filaments to the digestive organs the ovary o the oviduct the uter ine sac q the vulva m and the urinary organs n two anterior small sympathetic ganglia which receive nerves from the lateral ganglia ff of the brain e e are perceiv ed in this animal near the cardiac orifice of the strong dense muscular gizzard so that although the bulla is almost acephalous it has attained a considerable development both of its symmetrical and sympathetic systems of nerves instead of a simple nervous band passing over the oesophagus to connect the lateral ganglia as in the bulla there are two pairs of gan glia around that passage in the jantkina and in the limnea the ganglia are approximated to form a collar around the oesophagus in the doris the testacella and many others these ganglia are confined to a supraoesophageal position extending as a broad lobed nervous mass across the upper part of that canal in the chitons there is a broad supra cesophageal band and two closely approximated lateral gan glia below the oesophagus which send back large nerves to the foot and sympathetic filaments to the abdominal viscera the vermetus has like the aptysia a small anterior infra oesophageal ganglion besides the ordinary supraoesophageal and two lateral ganglia the infraoesophageal ganglion is situate beneath the muscular bulb of the oesophagus and a small sympathetic ganglion placed near the stomach receives filaments from the lateral ganglia and sends nerves to the abdominal viscera in the long body of the dentalium the brain forms a single lengthened quadrilateral ganglion ex tended longitudinally above the oesophagus and sending down small nerves on each side to complete the cesophageal ring in the pulmonated gasteropods the brain is generally more equally divided between the upper and lower surfaces of the cesophageal ring the broad ganglia in these two situa tions having a bilobate form the highest forms of the pec tinibranchiate gasteropods as the buccinum and the harpa have the greatest portion of the ganglionic matter of the ceso phageal nervous ring accumulated in a cerebral position above the entrance of the alimentary canal as seen in the annexed figure of the harpa elongata fig from new guinea where the mantle is opened to show the branchiae dy and the syphon c on the left and the mucous follicles the colon n and the male organ f on the right side of the respiratory cavity on opening the an terior part of the trunk the retracted proboscis g with its muscles h are seen extending backwards over the brain i which rests on the inferior turn of the oesophagus where the two salivary glands k k are also placed from this cerebral mass i large nerves are seen ex tending forwards to the head the tentacula with the eyes s s at their base and to the broad finlike ante rior fold a of this long tapering inoperculate foot other nervous chords extend downwards to the ventral surface of the abdomen and backwards to the sympathetics which supply the abdominal viscera this gradual concentration of the ganglionic matter of the great cesophageal nervous ring of the gasteropods into a cephalic position and form on the median plain above the alimentary canal is a pre liminary to its enclosure in a distinct cranial covering which takes place in the cephalopods the nervous system of the pteropods presents the same general plan and the same varieties of form in its ce phalic masses as seen in the gasteropods especially in the naked and swimming species in the clio bo realis fig b one of the small naked swimming pteropods there is a double nervous collar around the ossophagus as in the aplysia and many other gasteropods two small ganglia approximated to each other to form a bilobate brain are placed above the oesophagus im mediately behind the lips b and indicate by their diminutive size the imperfect development of the organs of the senses in this animal which scarcely presents a trace either of eyes or tentacula behind these central ganglia are two larger lateral ganglia connected together by a transverse band below the oesophagus and which supply the principal nerves to the muscular closed mantle enveloping the trunk two nervous bands proceed from each of this middle pair of ganglia one of which con nects them with the cerebral and another proceeding backwards connects them with a posterior pair of ganglia which are united by a transverse chord above the oeso phagus the ganglionic portion of this cerebral ring or perforated brain is more developed below than above the oesophagus in the pneumodermon where there is only a narrow transverse band above that passage and three pairs of ganglia disposed symmetrically below four of these inferior ganglia are almost in contact on the me dian plain and two are more lateral and separate but in the hyalea the nervous matter is chiefly concentrated into a large supraoesophageal broad ganglion of a quadran gular form which gives off branches from its four angles two of these nerves passing round the oesophagus enter a double ganglion placed below that passage the nearest approach to the vertebrated form of the nervous sytem is that presented by the cephalopods the highest of the mollusca and of all the invertebrata the oesophagus still perforates the brain as in all the infe rior classes but the greatest portion of that organ and the symmetrical columns prolonged from it are here placed above the alimentary canal the brain is enclosed in a distinct organized cranial cavity numerous symmetrical ganglia are developed on the great nervous axis both before and behind that organ and sympathetic ganglia are observed in the abdominal cavity the supraoeso phageal portion of the brain in the nautilus forms a thick transverselyelongated band imperfectly surrounded by the cranial cartilage and enclosed in a tough mem brane as in many of the gasteropods it is extended laterally into the small optic ganglia of this animal and is connected laterally with an anterior and a posterior suboesophageal ganglionic ring as in many of the inferior mollusca each of the suboesophageal bands exhibits two lateral ganglionic enlargements from which numerous branches are ramified forwards and backwards and the two columns are prolonged backwards from the lateral parts of the brain to the palleal ganglia as in other cephalopods in the loligopsis fig a the brain is enlarged both above and below the oesophagus and its superior portion which forms an oval encephalic mass is more completely surrounded with a cartilaginous cranium from the lateral parts of this encephalic ring come off the optic nerves and the two large longitudinal sym metrical columns a b d which run parallel and near to each other along the dorsal surface of the abdominal ca vity to the caudal extremity of the sac having the pal leal ganglia b in their course the cerebral ganglion of the octopus fig c forms a more globular concentrated mass enclosed in a thick cartilaginous cranium covered with a gelatinous cellular arachnoid and a dura mater giving off laterally optic nerves c b to very large optic ganglia cc contained within the sclerotic coat of the eyes the optic ganglia are sur rounded with lobed masses of adipose substance e e and send out a large radiated pencil of detached optic fila ments d to penetrate the choroid the brain is sepa rated from the oesophagus o and the aorta n by the membranous floor of the cranium the whole periphery of this perforated cerebral mass encompassing the oesophagus not being yet surrounded with the consolidated portion of the cranium on each side of the cranium is a small vestibular cavity occupied by a sac on which the audi tory nerve is distributed and containing a limpid fluid and a calcareous concretion in the sepia the brain is more distinctly bilobate of a yellowish white colour and pulpy consistence smooth on the surface and contained in a thick cartilaginous cranium which is perforated for the passage of nerves and gives attachment externally to the muscles of the head and trunk the cranium is continued round the oesophagus though soft on its interior part immediately anterior to the brain and the cranium is a large heartshaped supracesophageal ganglion of a yellowish colour resting over the oesophagus and sending forwards numerous large nerves to the labial ap paratus enveloping the mandibles on the lower part of the muscular bulb of the mouth are two small lateral ganglia which send in numerous large branches to the strong muscles of the mandibles both the labial and the mandibular ganglia are connected with the brain by distinct nervous chords below the ossophagus and an terior to the cranium are two large lateral pedal ganglia which send forwards large nervous trunks to pass ramify ing through the tubular axis of all the feet these two pedal ganglia are likewise connected by nervous chords with the sides of the brain the two optic nerves pass through the cranium from the superior or dorsal lobes of the brain and enter two large crescentic optic ganglia within the sclerotic as in other naked cephalopods the two great longitudinal nervous columns are extended backwards from the sides of the brain separate from each other and along the dorsal aspect of the trunk above the abdominal cavity to the large palleal ganglia which distribute radiating nervous chords chiefly to the interior muscular parts of the mantle the inner portion of each of these two symmetrical columns fig a b d extending from the brain along the dorsal region of the cephalopods does not enter the palleal ganglion but passing along the inner margin of that ganglion it penetrates the substance of the mantle by a distinct foramen and radiates into numerous rami fying chords which are distributed chiefly on the exterior parts of the trunk the principal branches of these ex terior palleal nerves extend backwards in the direction of the broad thin cartilaginous laminee which support the branchial muscles and two filaments extend inwards to the abdominal sympathetic ganglia a e e placed at the base of the branchiae near the lateral hearts by means of the two subcesophageal pedal ganglia anterior to the brain a second nervous ring is formed around the oesopha gus in the cephalopods as in most of the gasteropods and pteropods on opening the skull of the argonauta from be hind as in the annexed figure fig by chiaje the brain fl of a round form above separated from the inner parietes of the skull by the gelatinous arachnoid and extending downwards to encompass the oesophagus i is observed to give off laterally the large optic nerves which perforate the cranium to reach the pedunculated eyes and from its more anterior portion the separate great symmetrical columns b b which extend backwards to the palleal ganglia c c y on each side of the crop the aorta n and the salivary glands ra and above the branchiae and the genital organs by removing the anterior supracesophageal heart shaped labial ganglion and the osophagus the great lateral suboesophageal pedal ganglia are perceived to send for ward large nervous trunks d d d e e which extend rami fying through the central canal of each arm along with the bloodvessels a separate nervous tract like that seen in the dorsal columns of the cephalopods is seen to pass back wards along the sides of the supracesophageal ganglion of the buccinum and other gasteropoda and having the same pellucid appearance as the simple ungangliated nerves of most invertebrata the same tract of simple nerves is seen in the symmetrical columns of conchiferous mollusca especially as in the cephalopods at the great posterior pair of symme trical ganglia the dorsal columns prolonged from the brain are more approximated parallel and lengthened in the loligop sis and loligo than in most of the naked cephalopods which corresponds with the lengthened and narrow form of the trunk in these animals the great nervous trunks d d d proceeding from the inferior ganglia ffj anterior to the brain and accompanying the artery and vein pppj qqg through the axis of each arm send out lateral ramifying branches at regular short and decreasing distances from both sides corresponding with the position of the exterior suckers and these nervous trunks diminishing in size as they advance towards the apex of the arm present through out their whole course a beaded or knotted appearance like the nervous axis of a worm in the long cylindrical trunk of the loligo the nervous columns are continued from the two palleal ganglia along the whole extent of the dorsal sur face of the body and send out numerous lateral branches to the caudal fins which are seen radiating and ramifying to their extreme margins as the great trunks of the sympa thetic in the inverted bodies of the articulated animals occu py the dorsal region of the abdominal cavity and the sym metrical columns the ventral we find that in the cephalopods where the columns extend along the back as in the higher classes of vertebrata the branches of the great sympathetic proceeding from the inferior surface of the brain extend along the ventral aspect of the abdomen between the liver and the inkgland to the bottom of that cavity where they form a ganglion which sends nerves to the digestive the circulating and the respiratory organs so that although the brain of the cephalopods is still perforated by the oeso phagus as in all the inferior classes we find all the principal parts of the nervous system of the vertebrata already deve loped in this class and after undergoing a series of changes of form and position in the inferior tribes of animals regu lated by the general development and form of the body they have here acquired the form and situation which they pre serve throughout all the higher classes to man this system begins the development of its ganglionic axis in the lowest acephalous mollusca as in the lowest helminthoid articulata below the oesophagus and extends along the ventral surface of the abdomen but in the higher gasteropods as in the highest insects and crustacea we find it advanced in its position ac cumulated around the entrance of the digestive canal and mounting to a dorsal position which nearly the whole of the lengthened spinocerebral axis has attained in the cepha lopods fifth section nervous system of the spinicerebrated or vertebrated classes the great axis of the nervous system occupies en tirely a dorsal position in the vertebrated classes it is enclosed in an osseous sheath which is continued over its posterior prolongation and it is no where perforated by the alimentary canal the fibrous structure of the encephalic portion which is perceptible in the cephalo pods becomes more distinct and obvious as we ascend through the vertebrated classes and that anterior part of the nervous axis becomes likewise proportionally larger leaving only slight traces in the fourth ventricle of its original opening for the passage of the alimentary canal the spinal chord the medulla oblongata the optic lobes and the cerebral and cerebellic hemispheres form the most constant elements of this axis but their relative and actual developments vary in the different classes they are com posed of minute neurilematous tubular filaments which form two posterior contiguous sensitive or ganglionic columns and two anterior motor columns the filaments and nerves of which are not interrupted by ganglionic enlargements though much varied in the extent of its development in the different classes there is great similarity in the successive stages of the development of this system in the embryos of all the verte brated animals and great uniformity of plan in all its adult forms beginning with the two columns of the axis like the two chords of a worm it becomes reinforced by filaments from every part of the periphery and gradually receives its ganglionic enlargements as in all the inferior tribes where they are most required by the developing organs of the body the great sympathetic or nervous system of organic life which is extended along the upper or dorsal side of the symmetrical axis in the inverted bodies of the articulata is here developed along the ventral or under surface of the spinocerebral axis and like the sym pathetic system of the highest entomoid classes it is en closed with the viscera in a cavity distinct from that which envelopes the nervous axis of animal life in the long vermiform bodies of the lowest cyclo stome fishes as the lamprey the pride and the gastro branchus the two slender columns extended along the back and scarcely protected by a cartilaginous sheath are nearly without cerebellum and destitute of gangli onic enlargements in their course to the head where the minute cerebral elements are enclosed like the ganglia of a cephalopod in a cartilaginous tube con sisting of a single piece this simple condition of the axis presented by the lowest fishes resembles the pri mitive embryostate of this system in the highest ver tebrata before the extremities begin to shoot from the sides of the trunk in fishes as in cephalopods where a large exterior surface of the skull is required for muscular attachments the minute brain does not fill the cavity of the cranium and the space between the dvra mater which lines the skull and the pia mater which invests the cerebral organs is occupied by the soft transparent semifluid cellular tissue of the arach noid coat which passes down likewise through the ver tebral canal enveloping the spinal chord the spinal chord is nearly equal in its development throughout the vertebral column even in many of the anguilliform osseous fishes from the smallness of the arms and legs not requiring those enlargements which we observe in most higher animals where the nerves of larger and more powerful extremities are given off in species which have the arms of great magnitude as rays and flyingfishes there is a proportionate development of the upper enlargements of the spinal chord the num ber and the extent of these enlargements of the spinal chord in fishes corresponds with that of the members developed from the periphery of the trunk in the trigla fig c where the pectoral fins are of great size a series of ganglionic enlargements c b of the spinal chord a are observed at its upper part which corresponds in number with the number of the large detached rays of the pectoral fins presented by the different species trigla cuculus having five enlarge ments and five detached rays and the trigla lyra c having six of each the posterior extremity of the chord is sometimes sensibly enlarged where nerves pro ceed to the muscles of a large caudal fin and in abdo minal fishes an enlargement is observed corresponding with the ventral fins in some fishes with a great de velopment of the head and anterior portion of the trunk as the frogfish and the tetrodon the spinal chord passes but a short way through the vertebral canal and a long cauda equina extends backwards as in the human body the symmetrical nerves arise by double roots from the two grooves on each side of the spinal chord the motor nerves which commence more towards the tail than the sensitive originate from the anterior lateral groove and the sensitive nerves provided each with a ganglion be yond the vertebral canal originate from the posterior groove these unite as in the invertebrated classes to form mixed motosensitive nerves they give sensibility and motility to the organs of animal life and they send filaments to the sympathetics each vertebra being analo gous to a segment of the trunk and each pair of sym metrical nerves originating from the brain of that segment the nervous osophageal ring of the invertebrata is still perceptible in the wide opening between the lateral halves of the medulla oblongata of the lampreys the great fasci culi composing the cerebral masses the corpora py ramidalia olivaria and restiformia are already obvious in the large medulla oblongata of fishes but the crossing fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia are slightly marked they become apparent and numerous as we ascend through higher classes the medulla oblongata the apparent origin of most of the cranial nerves is here large and lobed and often nearly as broad as the cerebral organs before it in the cranium it is deeply marked above by a calamus scrip torius at the bottom of the fourth ventricle which is situate between it and the single median lobe composing the cere bellum anterior to the medulla oblongata and cerebellum there are generally in osseous fishes three pairs of rounded lobes placed in front of each other along the floor of the cranium and occupying but a small portion of that capacious cavity as seen in the brain of the congereel muraena conger fig a where these three pairs of lobes are nearly equally developed and similar in form the posterior pair a c immediately before the cerebellum a b are the optic lobes or corpora quadrigemina which are hollow in ternally as in the human foetus and give origin to the prin cipal fibres of the optic nerves the second or middle pair of lobes a e are the cerebral hemispheres which are here as in the human embryo destitute of internal ventricles and without external convolutions the anterior pair a are the olfactory tubercles which are entirely appro priated to the olfactory nerves a g a in the trigla lyra fig c where the medulla oblongata b b is marked by ganglionic enlargements and the cerebellum d is proportionally small the optic lobes e e are much larger than the cerebral hemispheres and the olfactory tuber cles g are much inferior in size in the perch fig b the medulla oblongata a forms two broad lobes at its anterior termination b over which the elevated cerebellum e arches backwards the optic lobes b d d have an elongated form the cerebral hemispheres e e much smaller than the optic lobes are extended vertically and the olfactory tubercles form two slight spherical enlarge ments at the commencement of the olfactory nerves g g in most fishes as in the earliest condition of the human brain the optic lobes are larger than the hemispheres they are smooth and cineritious on the outer surface and destitute of the transverse sulcus which gives them a quadrigeminous appearance in the adult mammalia they are hollow within and have their inner parietes lined with white medullary fibres the ventricles of the optic lobes communicate freely with each other and they open behind by a narrow aquiduct into the fourth ventricle beneath the cerebellum the interior white medully parietes of these two lateral cavities meet above on the median line and form an extended commissure like the corpus callosum of the hemispheres they descend along the median line to form a prominent ridge but not a complete septum between the ventricles the optic lobes of fishes like their medulla oblongata are larger in proportion to the cerebral hemispheres than in any of the higher vertebrata and they present the same great proportions the earlier we observe them in the human embryo their development corresponds generally with that of the corpora olivaria the optic nerves and the eyes but is in the inverse ratio to that of the cerebral and cerebellic hemispheres the inner medullary fibres of the optic lobes pass transversely and arch upwards over the contained ventricles but the exterior fas ciculi advance longitudinally to the optic nerves the cine ritious portion predominates in these and other parts of the brain as in the human embryo and the wide canal extend ing through the middle of the spinal chord of fishes corres ponds also with the fretal condition of that part in mamma lia these optic lobes the first formed portions of the brain anterior to the medulla oblongata being analogous to the supracesophageal ganglia which give origin to the optic nerves in the invertebrata are almost alone developed in the cyclostome fishes they are large compared with the cerebral hemispheres in most of the osseous fishes c they are comparatively small in the anguilliform fishes a their size is much reduced in the plagiostome chondropterygii d d and they become proportionally smaller as we ascend through the higher classes to man they contain within their cavity one or two pairs of tubercles and the large cor pora candicantia lie beneath them on the inferior surface of the brain the anterior and posterior commissures are al ready developed and also a rudimentary fornix anterior to the hollow optic lobes of fishes are the proper cerebral hemispheres a e which are scarcely percep tible in the cyclostome fishes are very small in most of the osseous fishes b e e c e e equal the optic lobes in the apodal fishes a e and have attained in the plagios tome species d e e a much greater size than these small optic lobes d d in the osseous fishes as in the embryo condition of the human hemispheres they are destitute of internal ventricles smooth and cineritious on the surface without external convolutions and they are com posed internally of radiating white fasciculi derived from the corpora pyramidalia in the rays and sharks d e e where the hemispheres attain a great size they already pre sejit inequalities on the surface they begin to extend back wards over the small optic lobes d d and they already manifest distinct ventricles in their interior which continue in almost all the higher animals to man the cerebral or lateral ventricles are continuous with the canals of the olfac tory nerves d as in all the higher classes these cerebral lobes perhaps the analogues of the thalamic optici are developed in the direct ratio of the corpora pyramidalia and crura cerebri and their increased development in higher animals corresponds also with the enlargement of the lateral lobes or hemispheres of the cerebellum before the cerebral hemispheres are placed the most an terior pair of lobes which here as in higher classes are ap propriated to the olfactory nerves and vary in their form size and situation more than any of the other parts of the brain these olfactory tubercles are generally in the osseous fishes b c p in immediate contact with the cere bral hemispheres and inferior to them in size in the an guilliform fishes a they nearly equal the hemi spheres a e and in the plagiostome fishes d gg they are placed on the course of the olfactory nerves at a greater or less distance from the hemispheres d e e and present a great transverse development exceeding in magnitude the hemispheres themselves in these last fishes the rays and sharks the large cineritious olfactory lobes are situated at the end of thick peduncles and lie immediately above the cribriform plate of the ethmoid which the olfac tory nerves perforate to be distributed on the extensive pituitary membrane covering the laminae of the nose the cerebellum forms only a minute transverse band on the median plain in the cyclostome fishes where it can be perceived and in the higher osseous fishes b c it still consists merely of a simple median lobe smooth on the sur face destitute of lateral hemispheres and analogous to the vermiform median lobe first developed in the cerebellum of the human embryo it rises vertically in the osseous fishes fig compressed between the optic lobes d and the lobes of the medulla oblongata b and generally ex tends backwards tongueshaped over the fourth ventricle but is destitute of the laminated surface which it begins to present in the plagiostome fishes this median portion of the cere bellum d e like the cerebral hemispheres e e is greatly developed in the muscular rays and sharks extending backwards over the medulla oblongata and forwards over the small optic lobes d d and already presents not only a transversely laminated structure as in higher classes but also small hemispheres extending laterally like tubercles from its base its magnitude here corresponds as in higher classes with that of the corpora restiformia which are conspicuous in the plagiostome fishes and it presents internally an ar borescent appearance of white diverging fasciculi arising from its laminated structure all these lobes contained within the capacious cranium of fishes are covered with cineritious substance and derive their internal white fibrous parts distinctly from the great fasciculi of the medulla oblongata the corpora pyramidalia olivaria and restiformia from the great size of the olfactory and the optic nerves in this class as seen in the perch fig ff q and also of the fifth pair m and from the small ness of the three pairs of lobes from which these nerves ori ginate the cerebral hemispheres e the optic lobes d and the medulla oblongata b appear only like small ganglia ap propriated to these nerves the olfactory tubercles are generally contiguous to each other and to the hemi spheres and the white fibres of the olfactory nerves g pass forwards on their lower surface from the cerebral lobes e two commissures are generally perceptible in the cerebral lobes and beneath the small lobules in the optic lobes a third ventricle is seen leading downwards to the in fundibulum and the large petuitary gland the pineal gland a c with its small peduncles is seen between the optic lobes and the hemispheres as in higher classes and is composed chiefly of cineritious substance from the great extent of the cranial cavity and the small ness of the brain the cerebral nerves have a long free course from their origin to their cranial foramina in the osseous fishes the optic nerves q generally cross each other with out uniting or intermingling their fibres but in the plagiostome fishes they unite and decussate as in mammalia fromthegreat size of the organs of vision in this class and of the muscles which move them not only the optic nerves are proportion ally large but also the third fourth and sixth pairs or oculo motory trochlear and abducent nerves which are the motor filaments of these muscles the abducent nerves advance forwards from the inferior surface of the medulla oblongata where they arise between the posterior fibres of the large trigemini this large fifth pair fig m arising from the sides of the lobes of the medulla oblongata immediately beneath the cerebellum c gives off the ophthalmic p which passes forwards through the orbit above the eye to be distributed on the upper part of the face the supe rior maxillary o which passes under the eye to ramify on the sides of the face and the inferior maxillary n which supplies chiefly the palate and lower jaw the prin cipal branches of the seventh or facial nerve i are dis tributed on the posterior part of the face and neck the great pneumogastric nerves arising behind the trige mini from the sides of the medulla oblongata present a large ganglion from which branches pass downwards to the branchiae and backwards along the oesophagus to the sto mach and air sac or rudimentary lungs and before these is a branch analagous to the glossopharyngeal which supplies the tongue and anterior branchial arch this great ganglion of the pneumogastric k is sometimes close to the origin of the nerve and sometimes remote and a branch from this nerve like the accessary of willis extending lon gitudinally on the side of the whole body near the lateral line sends filaments to the surface the pneumogastric supplies nerves also to the electrical organs of the torpedo the acoustic nerve arising between the trigeminus and the great pneumogastric descends to the vestibule and long semicir cular canals the spinal nerves like those of the cranium have gene rally a long course before they pass out through the inter vertebral foramina and the ganglia of their posterior roots are often so small especially in osseous fishes as to be scarcely perceptible and slight enlargements of the spinal chord can sometimes be distinguished at the origins of the several pairs of symmetrical nerves the great sympathetic arising from cranial nerves as high as the trigeminus is rein forced in its course backwards by branches from the spinal nerves and forms plexuses and ganglia as in higher classes before being distributed on the organs of the trunk it is more distinct in the plagiostome chondropterygii than in the osseous fishes and is least developed in the cyclostome spe cies it forms small ganglia along the sides of the vertebral column where it receives filaments from the spinal nerves and its plexuses embrace the arterial trunks before ramifying on the digestive respiratory and generative organs in the perennibranchiate amphibia and in the larva state of those which lose the gills the spinal chord the medulla oblongata and the cerebral parts contained within the cra nium present the same proportions and general conditions which we observe as permanent characters in most of the osseous fishes but the cerebellum is generally smaller in amphibia and reptiles than in all the other vertebrata as in the lower fishes the spinal chord in these inferior forms of amphibia is prolonged small and tapering through the greater part of the coccygeal vertebrae without distinct en largements where the nerves usually come off to the arms and to the legs the medulla oblongata is yet broad and lobed the cerebellum in form of a very small median trans verse lobe without hemispheres the optic lobes large cine ritious smooth without hollow within and quite exposed and the cerebral hemispheres extended longitudinally smooth and cineritious externally without internal ventricles and smaller than the optic lobes the metamorphosis of the caducibranchiate species changes the condition of their ner vous system from that of the lower fishes to nearly that of the reptiles above them and these changes are effected so rapidly that we can perceive a marked advancement in the development of the nervous system of the tadpole produced in one day in the tadpole of the common frog on the fourth day fig a the spinal chord is perceptibly en larged at its posterior part a and also the medulla oblon gata the cerebellum b is scarcely visible extended across the median plain the optic lobes c and the cerebral he mispheres e are small narrow and so far separate longitu dinally as to expose entirely the intervening optic thalami d on the following or fifth day fig b besides the general encrease of the spinal chord b the cerebellum b b is perceptibly enlarged the optic lobes b e are proportionately broader and shorter and the cerebral hemi spheres b e encreased in every direction begin to extend backwards over the optic thalami b d as the tadpole advances in its development and the legs and arms are ex tended from the sides the posterior and middle enlargements of the spinal chord are proportionately encreased the cere bral hemispheres enlarge and their white fibrous internal parts predominate over the cineritious covering but they present no convolutions nor ventricles by the rapid growth of the dorsal vertebrae and the obliteration anchylosis and absorption of the coccygeal vertebrae the spinal chord ap pears to recede from behind forwards within the vertebral canal and the cauda equina to lengthen the anterior extre mity of the chord is enlarged from the first as it gives origin to most of the cranial nerves and the posterior end is en larged for the cauda equina as is even perceptible in fishes and serpents here as in other classes where the spinal chord by the progress of development is retracted within its osseous sheath and the cauda equina is thus length ened in the adult state there is a greater distance ob served between the origins and the places of junction of the motor and sensitive roots of the nerves which com pose it and consequently between the intevertebral ganglia and the spinal chord and this is most manifest at the pos terior end of the column which has been most influenced by the metamorphosis the long narrow cerebral hemispheres of the adult frogs taper to the olfactory nerves which com mence with cineritious tubercles and the optic nerves are observed distinctly to cross each other before the optic tuber cles the changes effected in the nervous system by the metamorphosis of the higher amphibia closely resemble those produced by development in the human embryo their sympathetic nerves and ganglia are more distinct than in fishes in the class of reptiles the small cavity of the cranium nearly corresponds with the dimensions of the enclosed brain as in some fishes and the superficial cineritious sub stance still predominates over the internal white fibrous matter though to a less extent than in fishes and amphibia the cerebellum is remarkable for its proportionate smallness in this class and the cerebral hemispheres containing each a distinct ventricle now always exceed the optic lobes the spinal chord of serpents from their want of arms and legs is still destitute of enlargements as in the apodal fishes but the medulla oblongata is of considerable size and the fourth ventricle still uncovered by the small cerebellum descends into the spinal chord from the smallness of the brain and cranial cavity in the centre of the head of reptiles the rela tive size of these parts does not influence that of the whole head at different periods of life and the head preserves the same proportions to the rest of the body through life also in amphibia and fishes from the still imperfect development of the cerebral parts in this class the vital functions of rep tiles are less immediately dependent on them than in hot blooded animals and they longer survive their mutilation in the saurian and chelonian reptiles the posterior and mid dle enlargements are obvious on the spinal chord at the ori gins of the nerves of the extremities the wide medulla oblongata within the cranium is marked longitudinally by the limits of its three component fasciculi on each side and the decussating bands of its corpora pyramidalia are more dis tinct than in fishes the nerves of the body bear a large proportion to the size of the cerebral centres and corres pond in their distribution to those of the higher airbreathing classes the great ganglia and plexuses of the sympathetics now more closely accompany the arterial trunks as we see to become more exclusively their distribution from the articu lated and the mouuscous classes up to man the twelve pairs of cranial nerves are seen here as in birds and mamma lia and they chiefly arise from the enlarged medulla oblon gata as seen in the annexed figures of the brain of the tor toise emys europaa fig c d immediately before the anterior roots of the first cervical nerves d are seen on the inferior surface of the medulla oblongata the origins of the hypoglossal or twelfth pair of cranial nerves and on the sides the numerous branches of the spinalaccessory or eleventh pair before these are seen on the sides two por tions of the pneumogastrics and the glossopharyngeal or ninth pair close together are the acoustic and the facial nerves and towards the median plain below are the sixth pair or abducentes oculorum d b the small motor es oculorum are seen anterior to these last and on the sides the large trunk of the trigeminus the short and broad cere bellum c c not extending backwards to cover the fourth ventricle that cavity is found protected externally by a highly vascular membrane c b the small trans versely developed cerebellum consists only of the median lobe without hemispheres and consequently still is without the corpus dentatum in its interior it is smooth and cineri tious without and presents internally radiating fasciculi of white nervous fibres extending peripherad from its base the great transverse commissure of the cerebellum or the pons varolii is still wanting like the cerebellic hemispheres the optic lobes c d e reduced in their proportions and provided with internal ventricles e are partially encom passed on their fore part by the large tapering hemispheres the cerebral hemispheres d d destitute of convolu tions smooth and cineritious externally hollow within c g present internally the thalami optici and corpora striata and a distinct choroid plexus j c h towards the median side of their contained ventricles these hemi spheres are broad and short in the crocodilian reptiles and more lengthened narrow and tapering forwards in the in ferior tribes especially in the chelonia rudiments of cere bellic hemispheres are also seen in the crocodiles the ol factory tubercles d g are much smaller than in fishes cineritious externally and placed in contact with the cerebral hemispheres on the inferior surface of the brain in the chelonia d we observe an intimate union and decussa tion of the optic nerves d and behind these a long tubular hypophysis d e or continuation of the third ventricle into the infundibullum and petuitary gland the pineal gland c is still exposed on the upper part of the brain between the optic lobes and the cerebral hemi spheres all the parts of the brain are more compacted to gether in reptiles than in lower vertebrata the ganglia of the posterior or sensitive roots of the spinal nerves are now more conspicuous like the lateral and splanchnic ganglia of the sympathetics and the spinal nerves come off more nearly opposite to the places of their respective destinations than in the lower classes the nervous system of birds presents only a more elevated condition of the same plan of structure already developed in the crocodiles and inferior reptiles the great centres of the nervous system in the vertebrated animals like those of the vascular are at first developed in a lineal direction and ex tended longitudinally as we see in the fishes but at length acquiring encreased lateral development these parts in both systems become compacted together and accumulate upon each other to form a more short circumscribed and rounded mass more easily accommodated and protected as we see in birds and mammalia the spinocerebral axis fills the osseous cavities which protect it and the form and size of the upper part of the head now correspond with those of the enclosed brain at every period of life the spinal chord become more rounded in form has an encreased proportion of grey ganglionic matter in its interior and the white fibrous medullary portion is encreased in the brain the enlarged cerebral parts being now collected into a more compact form the hemispheres of the brain extend back wards to cover the optic lobes and come into contact with the greatly encreased cerebellum the olfactory tubercles have much diminished but retain their tubular communica tion with the still small ventricles of the cerebral hemi spheres the cerebral hemispheres still destitute of convo lutions and partially bilobate and the median lobe of the ce rebellum deeply laminated and sulcated transversely are the parts here most developed in the cranium and the white fibres of the great cerebral commissure the corpus callosum have begun to shoot across and unite the hemispheres not withstanding the great transverse extension of the cerebral mass in adult birds and its sudden tapering forwards to the olfactory nerves giving the whole brain a triangular appear ance it presents the same lineal arrangement and longitudi nal extension of its parts in the embryo which are preserved as the permanent character of the nervous axis of fishes this is easiest observed by examining its development in the transparent area of the cicatricula in the egg of the fowl where we perceive after two days incubation fig e the two halves of the spinal chord e a united posteriorly and already forming the vesicular enlargement e corres ponding to the caudaequina and pelvic dilatation orrhomboidal sinus of the adult the cervical and dorsal vertebrae begin to embrace the anterior portion e of the chord and three vesicular enlargements are seen on the cephalic portion of the nervous axis the posterior e c of these en largements forms the rudimentary lobes of the medulla ob longata the middle dilatation e d constitutes the out line of the optic lobes the anterior e e and smallest cephalic enlargement forms the embryo condition of the cerebral hemispheres in the chick and all these lobes are still disposed on the same plain and in a longitudinal direc tion as we find them in the adult fishes and in the embryos of mammalia they incline forwards as they develope up wards and backwards and laterally and in the adult condition the optic lobes reduced in their proportion and forced down wards and to the sides are covered by the expanded cerebral hemispheres which reach and even partially overspread the cerebellum the spinal chord still extends into the coccy geal vertebrae and the decussating bands of the corpora py ramidalia are more numerous and distinct than in the inferior vertebrata as seen in the medulla oblongata of the stork fig a k the cylindrical spinal chord a per forated by a small canal dilates on entering the cranium into a wide and large medulla oblangata a b which is not yet traversed by a cerebellic commissure or pons varolii the large cerebellum covers the fourth ventricle which is extnded into it as seen in the cassowary fig b df it consists of the vermiform or median lobe b d and a small rudiment of the lateral lobes or hemispheres a and it is deeply sulcated transversely on the exterior like the cerebellic hemispheres of mammalia the numerous me dullary bands which radiate outwards to the cineritious exte rior lamellae from the white fibrous parietes of the fourth ventricle bj produce an arborescent appearance when the cerebellum is divided vertically the ordinary great component fasciculi of the medulla oblongata are distinctly marked externally and the same nerves arise from this part as in reptiles and mammalia where the lateral tubercles or rudimentary hemispheres of the cerebellum are most distinct a small transverse commissure is already perceptible between them asin the human embryo but there is no corpus dentatum the optic lobes a c reduced in size and separated from each other
