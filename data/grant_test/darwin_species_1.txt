when on board hms beagle as naturalist i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers on my return home it occurred to me in that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes these i enlarged in into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision my work is now nearly finished but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have been urged to publish this abstract i have more especially been induced to do this as mr wallace who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society sir c lyell and dr hooker who both knew of my workthe latter having read my sketch of honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish with mr wallaces excellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors will have crept in though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts in illustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have been grounded and i hope in a future work to do this for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this cannot possibly be here done i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists some of them personally unknown to me i cannot however let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created but had descended like varieties from other species nevertheless such a conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration naturalists continually refer to external conditions such as climate food c as the only possible cause of variation in one very limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees in the case of the misseltoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its relations to several distinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself the author of the vestiges of creation would i presume say that after a certain unknown number of generations some bird had given birth to a woodpecker and some plant to the misseltoe and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life untouched and unexplained it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible and what is equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature but i shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation in the next chapter the struggle for existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase will be treated of this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected from the strong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and induces what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of growth in the four succeeding chapters the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given namely first the difficulties of transitions or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ secondly the subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and fourthly the imperfection of the geological record in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time in the eleventh and twelfth their geographical distribution throughout space in the thirteenth their classification or mutual affinities both when mature and in an embryonic condition in the last chapter i shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertainednamely that each species has been independently createdis erroneous i am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification chapter i variation under domestication causes of variability effects of habit correlation of growth inheritance character of domestic varieties difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species origin of domestic varieties from one or more species domestic pigeons their differences and origin principle of selection anciently followed its effects methodical and unconscious selection unknown origin of our domestic productions circumstances favourable to mans power of selection when we look to the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our older cultivated plants and animals one of the first points which strikes us is that they generally differ much more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature when we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment i think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as and somewhat different from those to which the parentspecies have been exposed under nature there is also i think some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food it seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation and that when the organisation has once begun to vary it generally continues to vary for many generations no case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation our oldest cultivated plants such as wheat still often yield new varieties our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification it has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability whatever they may be generally act whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo or at the instant of conception geoffroy st hilaires experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations but i am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception several reasons make me believe in this but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation to the action of any change in the conditions of life nothing is more easy than to tame an animal and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement even in the many cases when the male and female unite how many animals there are which will not breed though living long under not very close confinement in their native country this is generally attributed to vitiated instincts but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed in some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling changes such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed i cannot here enter on the copious details which i have collected on this curious subject but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement i may just mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in this country pretty freely under confinement with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family whereas carnivorous birds with the rarest exceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids when on the one hand we see domesticated animals and plants though often weak and sickly yet breeding quite freely under confinement and when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed longlived and healthy of which i could give numerous instances yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting we need not be surprised at this system when it does act under confinement acting not quite regularly and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or variable sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden i may add that as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions for instance the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation and vary very slightlyperhaps hardly more than in a state of nature a long list could easily be given of sporting plants by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant such buds can be propagated by grafting c and sometimes by seed these sports are extremely rare under nature but far from rare under cultivation and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset and not the ovules or pollen but it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation so that in fact sports support my view that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen or to both having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception these cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected as some authors have supposed with the act of generation seedlings from the same fruit and the young of the same litter sometimes differ considerably from each other though both the young and the parents as müller has remarked have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction and of growth and of inheritance for had the action of the conditions been direct if any of the young had varied all would probably have varied in the same manner to judge how much in the case of any variation we should attribute to the direct action of heat moisture light food c is most difficult my impression is that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect though apparently more in the case of plants under this point of view mr buckmans recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure nevertheless some slight amount of change may i think be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of lifeas in some cases increased size from amount of food colour from particular kinds of food and from light and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate habit also has a decided influence as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another in animals it has a more marked effect for instance i find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more in proportion to the whole skeleton than do the same bones in the wildduck and i presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less and walking more than its wild parent the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries is another instance of the effect of use not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears and the view suggested by some authors that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear from the animals not being much alarmed by danger seems probable there are many laws regulating variation some few of which can be dimly seen and will be hereafter briefly mentioned i will here only allude to what may be called correlation of growth any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal in monstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st hilaires great work on this subject breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head some instances of correlation are quite whimsical thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf colour and constitutional peculiarities go together of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants from the facts collected by heusinger it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons hairless dogs have imperfect teeth longhaired and coarsehaired animals are apt to have as is asserted long or many horns pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and those with long beaks large feet hence if man goes on selecting and thus augmenting any peculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth the result of the various quite unknown or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants as on the hyacinth potato even the dahlia c and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and subvarieties differ slightly from each other the whole organisation seems to have become plastic and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance is endless dr prosper lucass treatise in two large volumes is the fullest and the best on this subject no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance like produces like is his fundamental belief doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone when a deviation appears not unfrequently and we see it in the father and child we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both but when amongst individuals apparently exposed to the same conditions any very rare deviation due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances appears in the parentsay once amongst several million individualsand it reappears in the child the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance every one must have heard of cases of albinism prickly skin hairy bodies c appearing in several members of the same family if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule and noninheritance as the anomaly the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species and in individuals of different species is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex it is a fact of some little importance to us that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively or in a much greater degree to males alone a much more important rule which i think may be trusted is that at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age though sometimes earlier in many cases this could not be otherwise thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity and not to its primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or male element in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a shorthorned cow by a longhorned bull the greater length of horn though appearing late in life is clearly due to the male element having alluded to the subject of reversion i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalistsnamely that our domestic varieties when run wild gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made there would be great difficulty in proving its truth we may safely conclude that very many of the most stronglymarked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued it would be quite necessary in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home nevertheless as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising or were to cultivate during many generations the several races for instance of the cabbage in very poor soil in which case however some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil that they would to a large extent or even wholly revert to the wild aboriginal stock whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversionthat is to lose their acquired characters whilst kept under unchanged conditions and whilst kept in a considerable body so that free intercrossing might check by blending together any slight deviations of structure in such case i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view to assert that we could not breed our cart and racehorses long and shorthorned cattle and poultry of various breeds and esculent vegetables for an almost infinite number of generations would be opposed to all experience i may add that when under nature the conditions of life do change variations and reversions of character probably do occur but natural selection as will hereafter be explained will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants and compare them with species closely allied together we generally perceive in each domestic race as already remarked less uniformity of character than in true species domestic races of the same species also often have a somewhat monstrous character by which i mean that although differing from each other and from the other species of the same genus in several trifling respects they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part both when compared one with another and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied with these exceptions and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crosseda subject hereafter to be discussed domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as only in most cases in a lesser degree than do closelyallied species of the same genus in a state of nature i think this must be admitted when we find that there are hardly any domestic races either amongst animals or plants which have not been ranked by some competent judges as mere varieties and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct but naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value all such valuations being at present empirical moreover on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species we are soon involved in doubt from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parentspecies this point if it could be cleared up would be interesting if for instance it could be shown that the greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel and bulldog which we all know propagate their kind so truly were the offspring of any single species then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural speciesfor instance of the many foxesinhabiting different quarters of the world i do not believe as we shall presently see that all our dogs have descended from any one wild species but in the case of some other domestic races there is presumptive or even strong evidence in favour of this view it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary and likewise to withstand diverse climates i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions but how could a savage possibly know when he first tamed an animal whether it would vary in succeeding generations and whether it would endure other climates has the little variability of the ass or guineafowl or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer or of cold by the common camel prevented their domestication i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants equal in number to our domesticated productions and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries were taken from a state of nature and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion whether they have descended from one or several species the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is that we find in the most ancient records more especially on the monuments of egypt much diversity in the breeds and that some of the breeds closely resemble perhaps are identical with those still existing even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case what does it show but that some of our breeds originated there four or five thousand years ago but mr horners researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods savages like those of tierra del fuego or australia who possess a semidomestic dog may not have existed in egypt the whole subject must i think remain vague neverthelsss i may without here entering on any details state that from geographical and other considerations i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion i should think from facts communicated to me by mr blyth on the habits voice and constitution c of the humped indian cattle that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent with respect to horses from reasons which i cannot give here i am doubtfully inclined to believe in opposition to several authors that all the races have descended from one wild stock mr blyth whose opinion from his large and varied stores of knowledge i should value more than that of almost any one thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl gallus bankiva in regard to ducks and rabbits the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure i do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild duck and rabbit the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors they believe that every race which breeds true let the distinctive characters be ever so slight has had its wild prototype at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle as many sheep and several goats in europe alone and several even within great britain one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely and so with hungary spain c but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle sheep c we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe for whence could they have been derived as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parentstocks so it is in india even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound the bloodhound the bulldog or blenheim spaniel cso unlike all wild canidæever existed freely in a state of nature it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents and if we account for our several domestic races by this process we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms as the italian greyhound bloodhound bulldog c in the wild state moreover the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels which present any desired character but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or speceies i can hardly believe sir j sebright expressly experimentised for this object and failed the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes as i have found with pigeons extremely uniform and everything seems simple enough but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations hardly two of them will be alike and then the extreme difficulty or rather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent certainly a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and longcontinued selection nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed on the breeds of the domestic pigeonbelieving that it is always best to study some special group i have after deliberation taken up domestic pigeons i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world more especially by the hon w elliot from india and by the hon c murray from persia many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons and some of them are very important as being of considerable antiquity i have associated with several eminent fanciers and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing compare the english carrier and the shortfaced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks entailing corresponding differences in their skulls the carrier more especially the male bird is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids very large external orifices to the nostrils and a wide gape of mouth the shortfaced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock and tumbling in the air head over heels the runt is a bird of great size with long massive beak and large feet some of the subbreeds of runts have very long necks others very long wings and tails others singularly short tails the barb is allied to the carrier but instead of a very long beak has a very short and very broad one the pouter has a much elongated body wings and legs and its enormously developed crop which it glories in inflating may well excite astonishment and even laughter the turbit has a very short and conical beak with a line of reversed feathers down the breast and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood and it has proportionally to its size much elongated wing and tail feathers the trumpeter and laugher as their names express utter a very different coo from the other breeds the fantail has thirty or even forty tailfeathers instead of twelve or fourteen the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family and these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch the oilgland is quite aborted several other less distinct breeds might have been specified in the skeletons of the several breeds the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously the shape as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw varies in a highly remarkable manner the number of the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary as does the number of the ribs together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula the proportional width of the gape of mouth the proportional length of the eyelids of the orifice of the nostrils of the tongue not always in strict correlation with the length of beak the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus the development and abortion of the oilgland the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body the relative length of leg and of the feet the number of scutellæ on the toes the development of skin between the toes are all points of structure which are variable the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched the shape and size of the eggs vary the manner of flight differs remarkably as does in some breeds the voice and disposition lastly in certain breeds the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen which if shown to an ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds would certainly i think be ranked by him as welldefined species moreover i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier the shortfaced tumbler the runt the barb pouter and fantail in the same genus more especially as in each of these breeds several trulyinherited subbreeds or species as he might have called them could be shown him great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely that all have descended from the rockpigeon columba livia including under this term several geographical races or subspecies which differ from each other in the most trifling respects as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases i will here briefly give them if the several breeds are not varieties and have not proceeded from the rockpigeon they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number how for instance could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parentstocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rockpigeons that is not breeding or willingly perching on trees but besides c livia with its geographical subspecies only two or three other species of rockpigeons are known and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated and yet be unknown to ornithologists and this considering their size habits and remarkable characters seems very improbable or they must have become extinct in the wild state but birds breeding on precipices and good fliers are unlikely to be exterminated and the common rockpigeon which has the same habits with the domestic breeds has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets or on the shores of the mediterranean hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rockpigeon seems to me a very rash assumption moreover the several abovenamed domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world and therefore some of them must have been carried back again into their native country but not one has ever become wild or feral though the dovecotpigeon which is the rockpigeon in a very slightly altered state has become feral in several places again all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by halfcivilized man as to be quite prolific under confinement an argument as it seems to me of great weight and applicable in several other cases is that the abovespecified breeds though agreeing generally in constitution habits voice colouring and in most parts of their structure with the wild rockpigeon yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier or that of the shortfaced tumbler or barb for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin for a crop like that of the pouter for tailfeathers like those of the fantail hence it must be assumed not only that halfcivilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and further that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration the rockpigeon is of a slatyblue and has a white rump the indian subspecies c intermedia of strickland having it bluish the tail has a terminal dark bar with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white the wings have two black bars some semidomestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have besides the two black bars the wings chequered with black these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family now in every one of the domestic breeds taking thoroughly wellbred birds all the above marks even to the white edging of the outer tailfeathers sometimes concur perfectly developed moreover when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed neither of which is blue or has any of the abovespecified marks the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters for instance i crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs and they produced mottled brown and black birds these i again crossed together and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour with the white rump double black wingbar and barred and whiteedged tailfeathers as any wild rockpigeon we can understand these facts on the wellknown principle of reversion to ancestral characters if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rockpigeon but if we deny this we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions either firstly that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rockpigeon although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings or secondly that each breed even the purest has within a dozen or at most within a score of generations been crossed by the rockpigeon i say within a dozen or twenty generations for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor removed by a greater number of generations in a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character which has been lost during some former generation this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations these two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance lastly the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile i can state this from my own observations purposely made on the most distinct breeds now it is difficult perhaps impossible to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile some authors believe that longcontinued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility from the history of the dog i think there is some probability in this hypothesis if applied to species closely related together though it is unsupported by a single experiment but to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species aboriginally as distinct as carriers tumblers pouters and fantails now are should yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems to me rash in the extreme from these several reasons namely the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state and their becoming nowhere feral these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects as compared with all other columbidæ though so like in most other respects to the rockpigeon the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds both when kept pure and when crossed the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertilefrom these several reasons taken together i can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the columba livia with its geographical subspecies in favour of this view i may add firstly that c livia or the rockpigeon has been found capable of domestication in europe and in india and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds secondly although an english carrier or shortfaced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rockpigeon yet by comparing the several subbreeds of these breeds more especially those brought from distant countries we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure thirdly those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier the shortness of that of the tumbler and the number of tailfeathers in the fantail are in each breed eminently variable and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection fourthly pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care and loved by many people they have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth ægyptian dynasty about bc as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius but mr birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty in the time of the romans as we hear from pliny immense prices were given for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india about the year never less than pigeons were taken with the court the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare birds and continues the courtly historian his majesty by crossing the breeds which method was never practised before has improved them astonishingly about this same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old romans the paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone will be obvious when we treat of selection we shall then also see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite insufficient length because when i first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds knowing well how true they bred i felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches or other large groups of birds in nature one circumstance has struck me much namely that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants with whom i have ever conversed or whose treatises i have read are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species ask as i have asked a celebrated raiser of hereford cattle whether his cattle might not have descended from longhorns and he will laugh you to scorn i have never met a pigeon or poultry or duck or rabbit fancier who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species van mons in his treatise on pears and apples shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts for instance a ribstonpippin or codlinapple could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree innumerable other examples could be given the explanation i think is simple from longcontinued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races and though they well know that each race varies slightly for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences yet they ignore all general arguments and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations may not those naturalists who knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parentsmay they not learn a lesson of caution when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species selectionlet us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced either from one or from several allied species some little effect may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of life and some little to habit but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse a greyhound and bloodhound a carrier and tumbler pigeon one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation not indeed to the animals or plants own good but to mans use or fancy some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly or by one step many botanists for instance believe that the fullers teazle with its hooks which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance is only a variety of the wild dipsacus and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling so it has probably been with the turnspit dog and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep but when we compare the drayhorse and racehorse the dromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of one breed good for one purpose and that of another breed for another purpose when we compare the many breeds of dogs each good for man in very different ways when we compare the gamecock so pertinacious in battle with other breeds so little quarrelsome with everlasting layers which never desire to sit and with the bantam so small and elegant when we compare the host of agricultural culinary orchard and flowergarden races of plants most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes or so beautiful in his eyes we must i think look further than to mere variability we cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them indeed in several cases we know that this has not been their history the key is mans power of accumulative selection nature gives successive variations man adds them up in certain directions useful to him in this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have even within a single lifetime modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep in order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect the animals breeders habitually speak of an animals organisation as something quite plastic which they can model almost as they please if i had space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities youatt who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual and who was himself a very good judge of an animal speaks of the principle of selection as that which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the character of his flock but to change it altogether it is the magicians wand by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases lord somerville speaking of what breeders have done for sheep saysit would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself and then had given it existence that most skilful breeder sir john sebright used to say with respect to pigeons that he would produce any given feather in three years but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised that men follow it as a trade the sheep are placed on a table and are studied like a picture by a connoisseur this is done three times at intervals of months and the sheep are each time marked and classed so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world the improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice except sometimes amongst closely allied subbreeds and when a cross has been made the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction during successive generations of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eyedifferences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder if gifted with these qualities and he studies his subject for years and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance he will succeed and may make great improvements if he wants any of these qualities he will assuredly fail few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeonfancier the same principles are followed by horticulturists but the variations are here often more abrupt no one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock we have proofs that this is not so in some cases in which exact records have been kept thus to give a very trifling instance the steadilyincreasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted we see an astonishing improvement in many florists flowers when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago when a race of plants is once pretty well established the seedraisers do not pick out the best plants but merely go over their seedbeds and pull up the rogues as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard with animals this kind of selection is in fact also followed for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed in regard to plants there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selectionnamely by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flowergarden the diversity of leaves pods or tubers or whatever part is valued in the kitchengarden in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties see how different the leaves of the cabbage are and how extremely alike the flowers how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are and how alike the leaves how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size colour shape and hairiness and yet the flowers present very slight differences it
