essay on the theory of the earth prefaces by professor jameson although the mosaic account of the creation of the world is an inspired writing and consequently rests on evidence totally independent of human observation and experience still it is interesting and in many respects important to know that it coincides with the various phenomena observable in the mineral kingdom the structure of the earth and the mode of distribution of extraneous fossils or petrifactions are so many direct evidences of the truth of the scripture account of the formation of the earth and they might be used as proofs of its author having been inspired because the mineralogical facts discovered by modern naturalists were unknown to sacred historian even the periods of time the six days of the mosaic description are not inconsistent with our theories of the earth there are indeed many physical considerations which render it probable that the motions of the earth may have been slower during the time of its formation than after it was formedand consequently that the day or period between morning and evening may have then been indefinitely longer than it is at present if such a hypothesis is at all admissible it will go far in supporting the opinion which has long been maintained on this subject by many of the ablest and most learned scripture critics the deluge one of the grandest natural events described in the bible is equally confirmed with regard to its extent and the period of its occurrence by a careful study of the various phenomena observed on and near the earths surfacethe age of the human race also a most important enquiry is satisfactorily determined by an appeal to natural appearances and pretended great antiquity of some nations so much insisted on by certain philosophers is thereby shewn to be entirely unfounded these enquiries particularly what regards the deluge form a principal object of the essay of cuvier now presented to the english reader after describing the principal results at which the theory of the earth in his opinion has arrived he next mentions the various relations which connect the history of the fossil bones of land animals with these results explains the principles on which is founded the art of ascertaining these bones or in other words of discovering a genus and of distinguishing a species by a single fragment of bone and gives a rapid sketch of the results to which his researches lead of the new genera and species which these have been the means of discovering and of the different formations in which they are contained some naturalists as la mark having maintained that present existing races of quadrupeds are mere modifications or varieties of those ancient races which we now find in a fossil state modifications which may have been produced by change of climate and other local circumstances and since brought to the present great difference by the operation of similar causes during a long succession of agescuvier shows that the difference between the fossil species and those which now exist is bounded by certain limits that these limits are a great deal more extensive than those which now distinguish the varieties of the same species and consequently that the extinct species of quadrupeds are not varieties of the presently existing species this very interesting discussion naturally leads our author to state the proofs of the recent population of the world of the comparatively modern origin of its present surface of the deluge and the subsequent renewal of human society subjects so important and treated by one of the first philosophers of the age a man not less distinguished for extent and accuracy of knowledge than for originality of views and elegance of style cannot fail to excite very general notice to fix the attention of the naturalist on a new series of facts to admonish the sceptic and afford the highest pleasure to those who delight in illustrating the truth of the sacred writings by an appeal to the facts and reasonings of natural history this translation was executed by a gentleman well known to the philosophical world by his various useful writings the late mr kerr whom a sudden death has snatched from this transitory scene the few notes i have added will i trust be found interesting and the short account of cuviers geological discoveries which accompanies them will be useful to those who have not an opportunity of consulting the great work geology now deservedly one of the most popular and attractive of the physical sciences was not many years ago held in little estimation and even at present there are not wanting some who do not hesitate to maintain that it is a mere tissue of ill observed phenomena and of hypotheses of boundless extravagance the work of cuvier now laid before the public contains in itself not only a complete answer to these ignorant imputations but also demonstrates the accuracy extent and importance of many of the facts and reasonings of this delightful branch of natural history can it be maintained of a science which requires for its successful prosecution an intimate acquaintance with chemistry natural philosophy and astronomy with the details and views of zoology botany and mineralogy and which connects these different departments of knowledge in a most interesting and striking manner that it is of no value can it be maintained of geology which discloses to us the history of the first origin of organic beings and traces their gradual developement from the monade to man himself which enumerates and describes the changes that plants animals and minerals the atmosphere and the waters of the globe have undergone from the earliest geological periods up to our own time and which even instructs us in the earliest history of the human species that it offers no gratification to the philosopher can even those who estimate the value of science not by intellectual desires but by practical advantages deny the importance of geology certainly one of the foundations of agriculture and which enables us to search out materials for numberless important economical purposes geology took its rise in the academy of freyberg with the illustrious werner to whom we owe its present interesting condition this being the case we ought not as is at present too much the practice amidst the numerous discoveries in the mineral kingdom which have been made since the system of investigation of that great interpreter of nature was made known forget the master and arrogate all to ourselves in this island geology first took firm root in the north in edinburgh the wernerian geognostical views and method of investigation combined with the theory of hutton the experiments and speculations of hall the illustrations of playfair and the labours of the royal and wernerian natural history societies excited a spirit of inquiry which rapidly spread throughout the empire and now great britain presents to the scientific world a scene of geological acuteness activity and enterprise not surpassed in any other country on the continent the writings of cuvier distinguished equally by purity and beauty of style and profound learning have proved eminently useful in aiding the progress of geology in this country cuvier was first made known as a geologist by the publication of the present essay which from its unexampled popularity has made his name as familiar to us as that of the most distinguished of our own writers this fourth edition of the celebrated essay on the theory of the earth contains besides many additional facts and statements in regard to the natural history of the earth also learned discussions by cuvier on the newness of the present continents as confirmed by the history of nations and on the proofs regarding the antiquity of nations alleged to be contained in their astronomical and other monuments fossil organic remains are the relics of a primeval world long since gone past proclaiming with a loud voice the instability of earthly affairs and impressing upon the minds of those who seriously consider them sentiments of piety and feelings of devotion if the antiquary digs from among the ruins of herculaneum a piece of ancient money a vase or a statue we rejoice with him in finding the mode of life the manners and arts of an ancient people placed before our eyes if he finds an old record illustrative of the history of his country however limited in extent that country may be we are grateful to him for the particle of knowledge he has added to our store but if among the ruins of the common country of the human race we linger at the great sepulchre of animated beings destroyed by the hand of fate who can look upon it without sentiments of piety it is not here the statues of polycletus that we admire but the admirable monuments of the workmanship of nature taken from the ruins of the great herculeum overwhelmed by the ocean that we look upon with feelings of the deepest wonder and devotion the attention of naturalists was early directed to the investigation of the fossil organic remains so generally and abundantly distributed throughout the strata of which the crust of the earth is composed it is not as some writers now imagine entirely a modern study for even so early as the time of leibnitz we find that philosopher drawing and describing fossil bones after this period it continued to interest individuals and engage the particular attention of societies and academies the royal society of london by the memoirs of sloane collinson lister derham baker grew hunter jacobs plott camper and many others afforded satisfactory proofs of the importance attached to this branch of natural history by philosophers in england and the memoirs of m graydon in the transactions of the royal irish academy shew that it was not entirely neglected in ireland on the continent of europe the natural history of petrifactions was also much studied as appears from the memoirs of hollman beckman and blumenbach in the transactions of the royal society of gottingen of gmelin pallas herrmann chappe in the memoirs of the imperial academy of sciences of petersburg of geoffroi buffon daubenton faujas st fond and others of the old french academy of sciences of astruc and riviere of the royal academy of sciences of montpellier of collini of the academia theodoro palatina at manheim c but the geognostical relations of the rocks in which these organic remains are contained were but ill understood until werner pointed out the mode of investigating them his interesting and important views were circulated from freyberg by the writings and conversations of his pupils and have contributed materially to the advancement of this branch of natural history in germany france and also in great britain petrifactions are no longer viewed as objects of mere curiosity as things isolated and unrelated to the rocks of which the crust of the earth is composed on the contrary they are now considered as one of the most important features in the strata of all regions of the earth by the regularity and determinate nature of their distribution they afford characters which assist us in discriminating not only single beds but also whole formations of rocks and in this respect they are highly interesting to the geognostical inquirer to the geologist this beautiful branch of natural history opens up numerous and uncommonly curious views of nature in the mineral kingdom it shews him the commencement of the formation of organic beings it points out the gradual succession in the formation of animals from the almost primeval coral near the primitive strata through all the wonderful variety of form and structure observed in shells fishes amphibious animals and birds to the perfect quadruped of the alluvial land and it makes him acquainted with a geographical and physical distribution of organic beings in the strata of the globe very different from what is observed to hold in the present state of the organic world the zoologist views with wonder and amazement those hosts of fossil animals sometimes so similar to the present living species at other times so far removed from them in form and structure he compares the fossil orders genera and species with those now inhabiting the earths surface or living in its waters and discovers that there is a whole system of animals in a fossil state different from the present even the physiologist in the various forms connections and relations of the parts of those animals obtains new facts for his descriptions and reasonings such then being the nature of this branch of natural history it is not surprising that when once understood it should have many and zealous cultivators and occupy the talents of men of learning and sagacity in our time cuvier the celebrated professor of natural history in paris has eminently distinguished himself by his numerous discoveries accurate descriptions and rational views on this subject his great work on fossil organic remains of which a new edition is now in progress is the most splendid contribution to natural history furnished by any individual of this age the essay on the theory of the earth now translated is the introductory part of the great work of cuvier the subject of the deluge forms a principal object of this elegant discourse after describing the principal results at which the theory of the earth in his opinion has arrived he next mentions the various relations which connect the history of the fossil bones of land animals with these results explains the principles on which is founded the art of ascertaining these bones or in other words of discovering a genus and of distinguishing a species by a single fragment of bone and gives a rapid sketch of the results to which his researches lead of the new genera and species which these have been the means of discovering and of the different formations in which they are contained some naturalists as lamarck having maintained that the present existing races of quadrupeds are mere modifications or varieties of those ancient races which we now find in a fossil state modifications which may have been produced by change of climate and other local circumstances and since brought to the present great difference by the operation of similar causes during a long succession of ages cuvier shews that the difference between the fossil species and those which now exist is bounded by certain limits that these limits are a great deal more extensive than those which now distinguish the varieties of the same species and consequently that the extinct species of quadrupeds are not varieties of the presently existing species this very interesting discussion naturally leads our author to state the proofs of the recent population of the world of the comparatively modern origin of its present surface of the deluge and the subsequent renewal of human society in order to render this essay more complete and satisfactory i have illustrated the whole with an extensive series of observations and have arranged them in such a manner that they will be readily accessible not only to the naturalist but also to the general reader since the publication of the former edition of this essay many curious discoveries have been made in regard to fossil organic remains some of these are included in the illustrations at the end of the essay others want of room forces us to omit geological illustrations by professor jameson in civil history records are consulted medals examined and antique inscriptions deciphered in order to determine the epochs of human revolutions and verify moral events so in natural history we must search the archives of the world drawfrom the bowels of the earth the monuments of former times collect the fragments and gather into one body of proofs all the indices of physical changes which may enable us to retrace the different ages of nature it is thus only that we can fix some points in the immensity of space and mark the progressive stages in the eternal march of time m cuvier adopts the opinion of de luc that all the older strata of which the crust of the earth is composed were originally in an horizontal situation and have been raised into their present highlyinclined position by subsidences that have taken place over the whole surface of the earth it cannot be doubted that subsidences to a considerable extent have taken place yet we are not of opinion that these have been so general as maintained by these geologists we are rather inclined to believe that the present inclined position of strata is in general their original one an opinion which is countenanced by the known mode of connection of strata the phenomena of veins particularly contemporaneous veins the crystalline nature of every species of older rock and the great regularity in the direction of strata throughout the globe the transition and floetzrocks also are much more of a chemical or crystalline nature than has been generally imagined even sandstone one of the most abundant of the floetzrocks occasionally occurs in masses many yards in extent which individually have a tabular or stratified structure but when viewed on the great scale appear to be great massive distinct concretions these massive concretions with their subordinate tabular structures if not carefully investigated are apt to bewilder the mineralogist and to force him to have recourse to a general system of subsidence or elevation of the strata in order to explain the phenomena they exhibit there are many facts some of which are recorded in the bible that are hostile to cuvier and de lucs opinions stated in the text viz that the bed of the ocean was changed at the flood or last great catastrophe and that the land formerly occupied by animals was henceforth given up to fishes and other marine tribes we are told for example that the dove which was sent forth from the ark found an olivetree whence it plucked a leaf to carry back to the patriarch as a proof that the waters of the deluge were subsiding and we also find that the assyrian rivers which originally marked the situation of eden retained the same geographical relations after the earth had been repeopled the natural history of the fossil organic remains contained in alluvial deposits is also in opposition to the opinion of de luc formation of primitive mountains mitscherlich in a memoir read before the royal academy of berlin but not yet published enters fully into the illustration of the igneous origin of mountains especially those of the primitive class deducible from his experiments on the formation of minerals by fusion as the view is interesting we shall here give a short sketch of it have the primitive mountains of our globe whose form necessarily supposes a fluid state been dissolved in water or has the temperature of our earth been raised to such a degree that the substances of which our primitive mountains are formed have become fluid this question has been differently answered and the solutions given have been attempted to be supported in proportion as the observation of geological facts and the inquiries instituted with reference to the chemical combinations which compose the earth have been developed new observations and the discovery of unknown laws in chemistry and mineralogy must at the same time open a new field for speculation and observation in geology of the discoveries of our own times there certainly is none which has exercised a greater influence upon mineralogy than that of determinate proportions and especially the result of the researches of berzelius that the chemical combinations which nature produces are formed according to the laws which he has discovered with regard to artificial combinations a result which has entirely changed the aspect of this science and has elicited a new system of mineralogy in which the naturalchemical combinations are ranked with those which are artificial which affords a confirmation to the laws of crystallography as being the same in both cases it has been objected to the truth of the position that the laws of natural combinations are the same as those which artificial combinations follow that chemistry can decompose minerals but that in the formation of these combinations natural laws have been in activity which art would in vain attempt to reproduce but this objection is groundless the chemical affinity which acts in artificial combinations is a power of nature as well as the affinity which regulates the composition of natural combinations chemical affinity in general is a quality of matter in this objection modifying circumstances have been confounded with laws the chemist would very easily refute the objection if he could compose minerals of their elements and produce artificial combinations similar in all their characters to minerals themselves from such researches there would at the same time be diffused a new light upon geological investigations in this manner many phenomena would be reproduced which have taken place at the formation of the earth geological observations would be repeated by experiments which might be varied at pleasure forconfirming these observations and the recurrence in nature itself would be sought of those phenomena which have been produced in the laboratory inquiries which are however of great importance because they may be arbitrarily disposed and arranged according to the theory in view the importance of such attempts shew the value of any experiments that go to prove the formation of minerals by artificial means and mitscherlich has been very successful in detecting several mineral species formed artificially berzelius has shown in his chemical system of mineralogy that the greater part of the chemical combinations of which our earth is composed and especially the primitive mountains are analogous to salts and double salts and that in these combinations the silica carbonic acid and oxide of iron act the part of acids the silica combines with the alumina lime magnesia protoxide and peroxide of iron protoxide of manganese potash and soda forming with these bases either simple salts or double salts in proportions determined by the different degrees of saturation the carbonic acid is combined with the lime and manganese and the peroxide of iron with the protoxide the object which should be proposed in these attempts of which we speak is to investigate the relation of these bases to the three acids we find ourselves fortunately seconded in this attempt by a branch of national industry for the complete extraction of the greater number of metals depends upon the relation of the silica to the abovementioned bases the degrees of saturation in which the silica may occur with them the greater or less degree of affinity with which these bases combine with the silica and lastly the chemical qualities of the combination formed it is necessary for the metallurgist that he endeavour in order to attain his object completely to produce in proportion as the minerals differ different chemical combinations of the substances which compose these minerals but always in determinate proportions either by adding a foreign substance or by regulating the fusion by the choice of minerals the combinations which the metallurgist thus produces are ordinarily minerals which have already been found in nature sometimes even new species during a journey in sweden mitscherlich observed at fahlun where he made inquiries regarding the ores the scoriae and in general regarding the extraction of copper in order to form a correct idea of this operation not only some wellformed crystals in the scoriae but also found that the whole mass of the slag had a crystalline texture and that the crystals and the joints of the slags which had a lamellar texture remained the same at different periods of fusion provided only that the manner of operating of the metallurgist remained the same the examination of the crystalline figure of the slag proved that it was that of a mineral which has a composition analogous to that of the slag after having made this observation he found in almost every foundery which he visited in sweden different crystalline combinations which resembled minerals thus he found at fahlun silicate and bisilicate of protoxide of iron at garpenberg mica and several times augite and chrysolite these combinations have not only the same crystalline figures but also all the other characters of the corresponding minerals i have pursued these inquiries says mitscherlich since my return from sweden i have analysed the productions which i have found and the analysis has confirmed what the exterior had led to anticipate i have also augmented my observations by journeys in various districts of germany and farther i have been seconded in my researches by my friends so that i now possess upwards of forty different species of crystallized chemical combinations produced by fusion the greater number of which are minerals already known some are new species which have not hitherto been met with in nature the occurrence of mica which forms a predominant constituent part of our primitive mountains as an artificial production gave rise to the following geological speculations the artificial production by fusion of the minerals which compose our primitive rocks appears according to mitscherlich to place beyond doubt the theory that our primitive mountains were formerly a melted mass such a state of fluidity he continues affords an easy explanation of the figure of the earth of the increase of temperature as we proceed into its interior of hot springs and of many other phenomena with respect to this theory we may refer to m laplace who is convinced of its plausibility without grounding his belief upon the reasons which chemistry presents i propose however to make mention of a few facts in order to shew with what facility many chemical phenomena in geology may be explained by following this theory primitive mountains are generally distributed over the surface of the earth it necessarily follows that the bodies which have composed the surface of the earth have participated of the temperature which the primitive mountains have had at the period when they were in a fluid state the temperature at which water boils depends upon the pressure of the atmosphere and if the temperature of the earth increases we only require to diminish the mean height of the sea feet in order to have a pressure of an atmosphere more and it is by this pressure that the degree of temperature at which water boils will also be raised higher m laplace judges from the height of the sea during flowing and ebbing that the mean depth of the sea is about feet supposing threefourths of this mass of water were converted into vapour the pressure of this vapour would be nearly equal to atmospheres and this pressure would so augment the degree of heat at which water enters into ebullition that the primitive mountains might be in a state of fusion without the water with which they are covered being heated to the boiling point for the water which is not converted into vapour and whose quantity is a fourth of the whole mass of vapour according to the supposition which we have made would cover the whole earth because water expands in increasing proportion if the temperature be raised and because the expansion of water is much greater than that of the mass of our primitive mountains and consequently according to this supposition our primitive mountains are formed covered with red hot water the great pressure of so many atmospheres necessarily modifies the reciprocal affinities of the substances which compose the primitive mountains primitive mountains are distinguished from volcanic productions in this that the lime and magnesia which in them are combined with carbonic acid form with the silex silicates and bisilicates it is necessary that the silex which under the ordinary pressure and at an elevated temperature expels the carbonic acid exercise no influence under the pressure of so many atmospheres and it is not surprising that crystals of quartz occur in carrara marble in volcanic productions this pressure no longer exists and we should find among these the same phenomena which our laboratories and metallurgic operations present following this theory the circumstances that primitive mountains contain gypsum and carbonates and that water occurs in quartz very readily admit of explanation and with regard to this latter phenomenon the observations detailed by sir humphry davy afford an additional confirmation of the theory in question we may explain in the same manner another phenomenon which is more in connection with the present state of our globe many observations shew that the sea stood formerly at a much higher level than it does at present the water of the sea expands if the temperature be elevated more than the land admitting that the surface of the earth has a temperature of of reaumur and that the mean depth of the sea may be feet the height of the sea would then be feet higher than it is at present if we suppose as may be done without committing any great error that the expansion of the primitive mountains is equal to that of glass and that they have been at a temperature of and even at a much lower one the water of the sea would cover the secondary mountains in which we find the remains of marine animals this explanation of the former height of the sea appears very simple because the elevated temperature of the earth may have resulted either from its original state of fluidity or from a geological revolution which has destroyed at the same time the organic beings of a former period if primitive mountains and volcanic formations have been fluid and have crystallised on cooling it is necessary that we should retrace in them the same phenomena and the same laws which we still observe at the present time if a fluid body become solid by cooling these phenomena are differently modified according to the chemical nature of the bodies and according to the crystalline forms which they acquire on cooling but the laws remain always the same mitscherlich says i am in possession of some specimens which explain several of the phenomena so often shewn by basalt and volcanic formations i do not possess artificial basalt resembling the natural columnar kind yet the slags obtained at the furnaces of sahla resemble basalt so perfectly as to deceive the most experienced eye especially as their cavities contain crystals of augite but i have found at fahlun a bisilicate of protoxide of iron which has in consequence a composition analogous to that of basalt and which has distinct joints in this slag we perceive that the joints which are parallel to the axis of the prism and to the lateral planes of the crystals are always perpendicular to the plane of cooling this is particularly observable in a specimen which was obtained by melting the slag in a mould on crystallizing it had several planes of cooling and the joints are parallel to each of these planes the planes of separation in basalt present exactly the same phenomenon as this slag the phenomena which take place when a fluid body crystallizes may be observed in sulphur better than in any other body all fluid bodies however and even water on freezing present the same phenomena if a fluid body has cooled to the point at which it begins to become solid for example sulphur in a round vessel a crust of sulphur is not formed upon the surface of the cooled vessel and another crust upon the surface of the sulphur itself as might be expected on the contrary if a crystal be formed upon a point of the inner surface of the vessel the crystal enlarges by growing in the direction of its axis and the mass which surrounds the crystal remains liquid and sometimes cools without the molecules arranging themselves in the same manner as the crystal already formed on examining the cooled mass we observe that it shews a lamellar texture where the crystal was formed and that the mass which surrounded it does not shew this texture in the same degree this explains how veins of largegranular granite traverse a smallgranular granite as well as other phenomena of the same nature this observation also affords an explanation of another phenomenon if the half of the liquid mass has become solid and if the fluid part be poured off we obtain isolated crystals which have been formed in the fluid mass if the fluid part be not poured off and be permitted to cool slowly it contracts as is the case with most bodies and the contraction produces the same effect as the decantation small cavities will be formed and these will be traversed and covered over with distinct crystals we also observe this phenomenon in the geodes of primitive and volcanic mountains in which the crystals they contain are of the same minerals as those of which the mountains themselves are composed on the distribution of boulder stones in scotland holland germany switzerland and america numerous large blocks are met with in almost every country of europe and frequently far removed from their original situations this is frequently the case in scotland thus in the edinburgh district we have numerous blocks of primitive rocks of which no fixed rocks occur nearer than in our highland mountains in the north of holland germany and the countries bordering on the baltic enormous fragments of granite and syenite are scattered within certain limits according to humboldt it seems to be now proved that they have been carried southward with a distribution like that of radii from a centre from the scandinavian peninsula during some of the ancient revolutions of our globe and that they have not originally belonged to the granitic chains of the hartz and saxony which they approach without however actually attaining their basis born says humboldt on the sandy plains of the baltic and until the age of eighteen not knowing any other rock than these scattered blocks i could not but feel curious to know whether the new world presented any thing of a similar nature i was surprised not to find a single block of this description in the llanos of venezuela although the immense plains were immediately bordered to the south by a group of mountains entirely granitic and which presents in its broken and almost columnar peaks traces of the most violent action towards the north the granitic chain of the silla of caracas and of portocabello is separated from the llanos by a range of mountains which are schistose between villa de cura and parapara and calcareous between the bergantin and caripe i was equally struck with the same absence of blocks upon the banks of the amazon la condamine had already affirmed that from the pongo of manseriche to the strait of pauxis not the smallest stone was to be observed now the basin of the rio nigro and of the amazon is also but a llano a plain like those of venezuela and buenos ayres the difference consisting only in the state of the vegetation the two llanos situated at the northern and southern extremities of south america are covered with gramineae they are savannas destitute of trees the intermediate llano that of the amazon exposed to almost continual equatorial rains is a thick forest i do not remember to have heard that the pampas of buenos ayres or the savannas of the missouri j and new mexico contain granitic blocks the absence of this phenomenon appears general in the new world it is probably equally so in the sahara in africa for we must not confound rocky masses which pierce the soil in the midst of the desert and of which mention has often been made by travellers with mere scattered fragments these facts seem to prove that the blocks of scandinavian granite which cover the sandy plains on the southern side of the baltic in westphalia and in holland are owing to a particular debacle which proceeded from the north to a purely local catastrophe the old conglomerate gres rouge which covers a great part of the llanos of venezuela and of the basin of the amazon contains without doubt fragments of those same primitive rocks of which the neighbouring mountains are composed but the convulsions of which these mountains present undoubted evidences do not seem to have been accompanied with circumstances favourable to the transportation of great blocks this geognostic phenomenon is so much the more unexpected that nowhere in the world does there exist a plain so continuous and which is prolonged with fewer interruptions to the abrupt declivity of a purely granitic cordillera before my departure from europe says humboldt i had already been struck with the observation that there are no primitive blocks in lombardy nor in the great plain of bavaria which is the bottom of an ancient lake having an elevation of fathoms above the level of the ocean this plain is bounded on the north by the granites of the upper palatinate and on the south by the alpine limestones transition clayslates and micaslates of the tyrol boulders or loose blocks of alpine rocks are found in the lower part of the alpine valleys which terminate in the great principal valley that stretches between the alps and the jura from the lake of geneva to the lake constance and are also found almost every where in this great principal valley they are sometimes met with feet above the level of the sea on the side of the jura facing the alps and also in considerable numbers in many of the valleys of the jura itself these blocks occur only on the surface never in any solid rock and no one ever met with them in the subjacent strata of sandstone marl or conglomerate of the hills and valleys interposed between the alps and the jura but they are sometimes found deep in the soil or imbedded or surrounded with the debris formed by rivers the traveller is often surprised by the enormous magnitude of these loose blocks some of them being calculated to contain cubic feet the smaller masses are distinguished from those brought down by rivers by their position that is their occurring on heights and acclivities where no river could ever have run they may also be confounded with blocks from decaying conglomerate hence it is proper to be on our guard not only to distinguish these blocks from those derived from conglomerate rocks but also from the rolled masses belonging to river courses the height at which they are found does not appear to have any relation to their magnitude for we often find very large blocks at considerable heights and also in deep valleys and we also meet with small masses as well in the bottoms of valleys as high up on the mountains they occur sometimes in heaps or dispersed in single blocks but these relations have no connection with their magnitude because we often find large and small masses in the same heap and single large and small blocks on mountain summits and in the bottoms of valleys the smaller blocks are more or less rounded but seldom so much so as the boulders of rivers which have been exposed to long continued friction the larger blocks are indeed angular but not sharp edged but in examining this relation we must carefully distinguish whether or not the angles or edges are original or have been produced by subsequent natural or artificial causes very often masses of this description are blasted with gunpowder either with the view of clearing the fields or of obtaining stones for building and these if left on the ground may lead into error these blocks vary in their nature some being of the primitive class while others belong to those of the transition and secondary classes in general they appertain to rock formations situated nearer to the central alpine chains than those of the places where they are found thus no rocks of the transition class occur in gneiss valleys no alpine limestone in transition valleys and in general nowhere but in jura do blocks of jura limestone make their appearance therefore all the loose blocks of rocks between the jura and the alps belong to the strata of the high chains of the alps but these blocks have different characters in different districts the loose blocks which occur in the river basin of the rhone and the lake of geneva are quite different from those which lie strewed about in the river basin of the rhine these again are equally different from the loose blocks of the river basin of the aare as those of the aare are from the blocks of the lake of zurich and the valley of limmat and these in their turn are equally well distinguished from the great accumulations in the valley of the reuss it rarely happens that intermixtures take place among these different accumulations of debris and this is a circumstance which must be attended to in our investigation it results from an accurate comparison of these loose blocks with those mountain rocks which occur in extensive chains in the high alps that the loose blocks of every known river basin agree with the rocks which form the sides of the upper parts of those high alpine valleys which are in immediate connection with these great water basins thus the loose blocks of the water basin of the rhine are similar to the rocks of bundten we find in the lake of zurich and in the limmat valley the rocks of the glarner land in loose blocks the debris in the basin of the reuss consists of rocks of the mountains from which the reuss takes its rise the loose blocks of the water basin of the aare are similar to the mountain rocks of the high alps of bern and the loose blocks found in the course of the rhone occur in fixed rocks in the vallais it thus appears that the loose blocks are by no means irregularly dispersed over the great valley between the alps and the jura but are distributed in the direction of distinct water basins it also appears that the loose blocks are not irregularly distributed in these different basins on the contrary that in some parts of the basin they are accumulated in great numbers in other places they are rare and in some situations none occur from the preceding observations we may obtain some hints of importance in respect of the cause of this remarkable phenomenon these loose blocks already occur in the alpine valleys which open into the great valley between the alps and the jura they are found more abundantly in the wide parts of valleys immediately below the narrow or contracted passes and few occur in the narrow steep and rocky parts of the valleys loose blocks are found at a greater or less height in the smaller lateral valleys that open into the transverse alpine valleys which terminate in the great valley between the alps and the jura if these lateral valleys form passes which lead over into other valleys by a lowering of the high mountain chain which are not more than feet above the level of the sea loose blocks occur not only in these passes but also more or less widely distributed in the opposite valleys in the great principal valley which stretches between the alps and the jura from the lake of geneva to beyond the lake constance we find these loose blocks dispersed over all the hills whose elevation is not more than feet above the level of the sea but even here the distribution of the blocks is not entirely irregular the largest are found on such hills and acclivities as are opposite the mouths of the alpine valleys in the great principal valley the blocks are frequently found higher on such acclivities than on the sides of those valleys which may be considered as a continuation of the alpine valleys the loose blocks are found every where on that acclivity of the jura range which is opposite to the alps and they are found highest and largest in those places which are directly opposite the mouths of the alpine valleys in such places the blocks again attain an elevation of nearly feet above the level of the sea whereas in the intermediate places which are most remote from the places opposite the mouths of the alpine valleys the blocks seldom reach at a height of feet above the level of the sea in those places where the jura chain branches into the great valley between the jura and the alps loose blocks are found in the valleys behind the projecting chains the jura range is sometimes intersected in places opposite to the alps and it is remarked that loose blocks are met with in the valleys behind these intersected portions of the range and that when loose blocks occur in the jura range at a distance from the alps it is only in such places as are directly opposite to the intersected portions of the chain opposite to the alps the circumstance of the nonoccurrence of these blocks in the sandstone marl and nagelfluh which occupy the great valley between the alps and the jura proves that that revolution of our globe by which these were dispersed took place after the formation of these rocks and may therefore have belonged to one of the latest changes which have contributed to the present form of the earths surface when we compare the relations of the alluvium of the rivers in valleys with those of the loose blocks their similarity must strike every one thus rolled masses are seldom deposited in those places where a river forces its way through a narrow passage but where an expansion takes place owing to the distance of the banks increasing the rolled masses are sometimes accumulated in whole banks the same loose blocks seldom occur in the narrow passages of the transverse valleys in the alps but as soon as widenings of the valleys take place below these narrowings the blocks occur in abundance if during a flood a rupture takes place in the banks of a river where it is contracted a part of the stream will flow out by the lateral opening and carry along with it rolled masses even when the opening in the bank does not reach to the bottom of the bed of the river for the mountain stream loaded with boulders carries them not merely in single masses along its bottom but the floodwater of the stream generally attacks large sandbanks or older beds of rolled masses and carries along with it accompanied with a terrible noise whole masses forces them over the lower banks or through the chasm in the bank and often deposites them several feet high on an immediately succeeding widening of the rivers course in the same manner we observe loose blocks deposited on high situations in the lateral valleys of the great transverse valleys and dispersed over the passes into the neighbouring valleys the height of the lateral deposites of loose blocks and their position in the passes and their passing into neighbouring valleys are facts which assist us in judging of the extent of the power that may have acted during their transportation the striking agreement observable in the phenomena of the distribution of the loose blocks from the interior alpine valleys to the interior valleys of the jura with those in the rolled masses carried along by rivers must lead every one who reflects on this interesting phenomenon to the hypothesis that these blocks may have been deposited in their present situations by an overwhelming flood which burst from the alps it is true that this opinion is liable to many objections but still it contains a more plausible explanation of the phenomenon than any other with which we are acquainted the loose blocks in the different riverdistricts being in general separated from each other or if any intermixture takes place of the rolled masses of one valley with that of another it being only on their edges it is highly probable that the floods which burst from these valleys and carried along with them the masses of rocks may have been simultaneous by which the flow of the one basin would bound and limit that of the other and thus prevent the waterflood of one basin flowing into the neighbouring ones the contemporaneous occurrence of these different floods from the alpine valleys can alone on this hypothesis explain why this aqueous flood was so generally and so highly accumulated in the great valleys between the alps and the jura as to reach the height of most of the sandstone mountains and to a great elevation in the jura where many blocks are found deposited but if the contemporaneous occurrence of these floods is proved by the facts already enumerated to what cause are we to refer this simultaneous bursting of floods of water from so many alpine valleys we observe on the northwestern side of the chain of the alps numerous openings which by their structure seem to point out the action of violent floods let us suppose the numerous valleys in the districts already described closed at their present entrances or openings as would seem from their structure to have been formerly the case the consequence of this arrangement would be the filling of the alpine valleys with water to the height of the lowest passes among the mountains and thus an enormous accumulation of water would take place this great body of water if let loose at once by the bursting of the lower extremities of the valleys would form a flood which would sweep across the sandstone mountains between the alps and the jura range and even ascend high on the jura itself this flood of water moving probably at the rate of feet in a second and loaded with debris of rocks would carry masses even these having a magnitude of cubical feet some thousand feet high on the jura range geologists maintain that the blocks or boulders met with in other countries and arranged as those in switzerland have been deposited where we now find them by the bursting of lakes while those found on the shores of the baltic are conjectured to have been transported by a great rush of water caused by the sudden elevation of the land of scandinavia another opinion has its advocates which maintains that these boulders have been spread over different countries by the waters of the deluge on the alluvial land of the danish islands in the baltic and on the coast of sleswigh in this section cuvier gives a clear and distinct account of several kinds of alluvial formations m de luc in the first volume of his geological travels describes the alluvial formations that cover and bound many of the islands in the baltic and upon the coast of denmark and gives so interesting an account of the modes followed by the inhabitants in preserving these alluvial deposites that we feel pleasure in communicating it to our readers note g p on the sandflood in different parts of scotland as in aberdeenshire hebrides and shetland islands there are examples of the natural chronometer mentioned in the text in morayshire there is a striking example of the sandflood concerning which the following details have been furnished by my young friend the rev mr ritchie in the outer hebrides the effects of the sandflood are also considerable as shewn in the following notice communicated by my intelligent assistant mr macgillivray we may add as this subject is a very interesting one that further details in regard to the moving sands of scotland will be found on consulting the statistical account of scotland vol xx p in the appendix to the account of the parish of dyke vol xx p et seq there is an account of the sandhills of maviston which overwhelmed the barony of coubine as mentioned in mr ritchies communication in vol xix p is a notice of the shifting of two hills of the mavieston range yards in twenty years in vol xxi p is a notice of some hundred acres in duffus parish covered three feet deep by drift sand fourteen inches accumulating in one night in neils tour in orkney and shetland it is observed that in the neighbourhood of the castle of noltlandin westra much havoc has been done by the blowing of the sand no measures are there employed for putting a stop to this kind of devastation in the th volume of the highland societys transactions will be found a report of the operations carried on in harris and alluded to in mr macgillivrays communication and in dr walkers account of the hebrides and mr macdonalds work on the hebrides farther details may be seen in jamesons account of the shetland islands and in shirreffand flemings reports on these islands are also facts connected with this devastating agent we may add that dr oudney major denham and captain clapperton have added to our knowledge of the blowing sands of the african deserts the coloured engraving of the sandhills of the african desert in denham oudney and clappertons narrative is a striking and interesting representation of the form of the moving sandhills of africa the moving sands of africa and their effects are thus described in the mercure de france for september by de luc the sands of the lybian desert he says driven by the west winds have left no lands capable of tillage on any parts of the western banks of the nile not sheltered by mountains the encroachment of these sands on soils which were formerly inhabited and cultivated is evidently seen m denon informs us in the account of his travels in lower and upper egypt that summits of the ruins of ancient cities buried under these sands still appear externally and that but for a ridge of mountains called the lybian chain which borders the left bank of the nile and forms in the parts where it rises a barrier against the invasion of these sands the shores of the river on that side would long since have ceased to be habitable nothing can be more melancholy says this traveller than to walk over villages swallowed up by the sand of the desert to trample under foot their roofs to strike against the summits of their minarets to reflect that yonder were cultivated fields that there grew trees that here were even the dwellings of men and that all has vanished if then our continents were as ancient as has been pretended no traces of the habitation of men would appear on any part of the western bank of the nile which is exposed to this scourge of the sands of the desert the existence therefore of such monuments attests the successive progress of the encroachments of the sand and those parts of the bank formerly inhabited will for ever remain arid and waste thus the great population of egypt announced by the vast and numerous ruins of its cities was in great part due to a cause of fertility which no longer exists and to which sufficient attention has not been given the sands of the desert were formerly remote from egypt the oases or habitable spots still appearing in the midst of the sands being the remains of the soils formerly extending the whole way to the nile but these sands transported hither by the western winds have overwhelmed and buried this extensive tract and doomed to sterility a land which was once remarkable for its fruitfulness it is therefore not solely to her revolutions and changes of sovereigns that egypt owes the loss of her ancient splendour it is also to her having been thus irrecoverably deprived of a tract of land by which before the sands of the desert had covered it and caused it to disappear her wants had been abundantly supplied now if we fix our attention on this fact and reflect on the consequences which would have attended it if thousands or only some hundreds of centuries had elapsed since our continents first existed above the level of the sea does it not evidently appear that all the country on the west of the nile would have been buried under this sand before the erection of the cities of ancient egypt how remote soever that period may be supposed and that in a country so long afflicted with sterility no idea would even have been formed of constructing such vast and numerous edifices when these cities indeed were built another cause concurred in favouring their prosperity the navigation of the red sea was not then attended with any danger on the coasts all its ports now nearly blocked up with reefs of coral had a safe and easy access the vessels laden with merchandize and provisions could enter them and depart without risk of being wrecked on these shoals which have risen since that time and are still increasing in extent the defects of the present government of egypt and the discovery of the passage from europe to india round the cape of good hope are therefore not the only causes of the present state of decline of this country if the sands of the desert had not invaded the bordering lands on the west if the work of the sea polypi in the red sea had not rendered dangerous the access to its coasts and to its ports and even filled up some of the latter the population of egypt and the adjacent countries together with their product would alone have sufficed to maintain them in a state of prosperity and abundance but now though the passage to india by the cape of good hope should cease to exist though the political advantages which egypt enjoyed during the briliant period of thebes and memphis should be reestablished she could never again attain the same degree of splendour thus the reefs of coral which had been raised in the red sea on the east of egypt and the sands of the desert which invade it on the west concur in attesting this truth that our continents are not of a more remote antiquity than has been assigned to them by the sacred historian in the book of genesis from the great era of the deluge note h p action of the sea upon coasts the ocean in its action upon the cliffs and banks situated on the coast breaks them down to a greater or less extent and either accumulates the debris at their basis in the form of sea beaches of greater or less magnitude or by currents carries it away to be deposited upon other shores or to give rise to sandbanks near the coast which in the course of time become united to the land and thus secure it from the further action of the sea these destroying and forming effects of the waters of the ocean are to be observed all around the coasts of this island and beautiful examples of such actions are to be seen on the coasts of ireland and in many of the islands that lie to the west and north of great britian in a paper read before the wernerian natural history society mr stevenson engineer mentions many facts illustrative of the destroying effects of the ocean on our coasts thus he informs us that the waters of the sea are wearing away the land upon both sides of the frith
