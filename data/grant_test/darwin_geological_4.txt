vesuvius and with the olivine described by von buch as projecting in great balls from the basalt of lanzarote besides the albite this lava contains scattered grains of a green mineral with no distinct cleavage and closely resembling olivine but as it fuses easily into a green glass it belongs probably to the augitic family at james island however a similar lava contained true olivine i obtained specimens from the actual surface and from a depth of four feet but they differed in no respect the high degree of fluidity of this lavastream was at once evident from its smooth and gently sloping surface from the manner in which the main stream was divided by small inequalities into little rills and especially from the manner in which its edges far below its source and where it must have been in some degree cooled thinned out to almost nothing the actual margin consisting of loose fragments few of which were larger than a mans head the contrast between this margin and the steep walls above twenty feet high bounding many of the basaltic streams at ascension is very remarkable it has generally been supposed that lavas abounding with large crystals and including angular vesicles have possessed little fluidity but we see that the case has been very different at albemarle island the degree of fluidity in different lavas does not seem to correspond with any apparent corresponding amount of difference in their composition at chatham island some streams containing much glassy albite and some olivine are so rugged that they may be compared to a sea frozen during a storm whilst the great stream at albemarle island is almost as smooth as a lake when ruffled by a breeze at james island black basaltic lava abounding with small grains of olivine presents an intermediate degree of roughness its surface being glossy and the detached fragments resembling in a very singular manner folds of drapery cables and pieces of the bark of trees craters of tuffabout a mile southward of banks cove there is a fine elliptic crater about feet in depth and three quarters of a mile in diameter its bottom is occupied by a lake of brine out of which some little crateriform hills of tuff rise the lower beds are formed of compact tuff appearing like a subaqueous deposit whilst the upper beds round the entire circumference consist of a harsh friable tuff of little specific gravity but often containing fragments of rock in layers this upper tuff contains numerous pisolitic balls about the size of small bullets which differ from the surrounding matter only in being slightly harder and finer grained the beds dip away very regularly on all sides at angles varying as i found by measurement from to degrees the external surface of the crater slopes at a nearly similar inclination and is formed by slightly convex ribs like those on the shell of a pecten or scallop which become broader as they extend from the mouth of the crater to its base these ribs are generally from eight to twenty feet in breadth but sometimes they are as much as forty feet broad and they resemble old plastered much flattened vaults with the plaster scaling off in plates they are separated from each other by gullies deepened by alluvial action at their upper and narrow ends near the mouth of the crater these ribs often consist of real hollow passages like but rather smaller than those often formed by the cooling of the crust of a lavastream whilst the inner parts have flowed onwardof which structure i saw many examples at chatham island there can be no doubt but that these hollow ribs or vaults have been formed in a similar manner namely by the setting or hardening of a superficial crust on streams of mud which have flowed down from the upper part of the crater in another part of this same crater i saw open concave gutters between one and two feet wide which appear to have been formed by the hardening of the lower surface of a mudstream instead of as in the former case of the upper surface from these facts i think it is certain that the tuff must have flowed as mud this mud may have been formed either within the crater or from ashes deposited on its upper parts and afterwards washed down by torrents of rain the former method in most of the cases appears the more probable one at james island however some beds of the friable kind of tuff extend so continuously over an uneven surface that probably they were formed by the falling of showers of ashes within this same crater strata of coarse tuff chiefly composed of fragments of lava about like a consolidated talus against the inside walls they rise to a height of between and feet above the surface of the internal brinelake they dip inwards and are inclined at an angle varying from to degrees they appear to have been formed beneath water probably at a period when the sea occupied the hollow of the crater i was surprised to observe that beds having this great inclination did not as far as they could be followed thicken towards their lower extremities banks covethis harbour occupies part of the interior of a shattered crater of tuff larger than that last described all the tuff is compact and includes numerous fragments of lava it appears like a subaqueous deposit the most remarkable feature in this crater is the great development of strata converging inwards as in the last case at a considerable inclination and often deposited in irregular curved layers these interior converging beds as well as the proper diverging crateriform strata are represented in the accompanying rude sectional sketch of the headlands forming this cove the internal and external strata differ little in composition and the former have evidently resulted from the wear and tear and redeposition of the matter forming the external crateriform strata from the great development of these inner beds a person walking round the rim of this crater might fancy himself on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified sandstone and conglomerate the sea is wearing away the inner and outer strata and especially the latter so that the inwardly converging strata will perhaps in some future age be left standing alonea case which might at first perplex a geologist james islandtwo craters of tuff on this island are the only remaining ones which require any notice one of them lies a mile and ahalf inland from puerto grande it is circular about the third of a mile in diameter and feet in depth it differs from all the other tuffcraters which i examined in having the lower party of its cavity to the height of between and feet formed by a precipitous wall of basalt giving to the crater the appearance of having burst through a solid sheet of rock the upper part of this crater consists of strata of the altered tuff with a semiresinous fracture its bottom is occupied by a shallow lake of brine covering layers of salt which rest on deep black mud the other crater lies at the distance of a few miles and is only remarkable from its size and perfect condition its summit is feet above the level of the sea and the interior hollow is feet deep its external sloping surface presented a curious appearance from the smoothness of the wide layers of tuff which resembled a vast plastered floor brattle island is i believe the largest crater in the archipelago composed of tuff its interior diameter is nearly a nautical mile at present it is in a ruined condition consisting of little more than half a circle open to the south its great size is probably due in part to internal degradation from the action of the sea segment of a small basaltic craterone side of freshwater bay in james island is bounded by a promontory which forms the last wreck of a great crater on the head of this promontory a quadrantshaped segment of a small subordinate point of eruption stands exposed it consists of nine separate little streams of lava piled upon each other and of an irregular pinnacle about fifteen feet high of reddishbrown vesicular basalt abounding with large crystals of glassy albite and with fused augite this pinnacle and some adjoining paps of rock on the beach represent the axis of the crater the streams of lava can be followed up a little ravine at right angles to the coast for between ten and fifteen yards where they are hidden by detritus along the beach they are visible for nearly eighty yards and i do not believe that they extend much farther the three lower streams are united to the pinnacle and at the point of junction as is shown in the accompanying rude sketch made on the spot they are slightly arched as if in the act of flowing over the lip of the crater the six upper streams no doubt were originally united to this same column before it was worn down by the sea the lava of these streams is of similar composition with that of the pinnacle excepting that the crystals of albite appear to be more comminuted and the grains of fused augite are absent each stream is separated from the one above it by a few inches or at most by one or two feet in thickness of loose fragmentary scoriæ apparently derived from the abrasion of the streams in passing over each other all these streams are very remarkable from their thinness i carefully measured several of them one was eight inches thick but was firmly coated with three inches above and three inches below of red scoriaceous rock which is the case with all the streams making altogether a thickness of fourteen inches this thickness was preserved quite uniformly along the entire length of the section a second stream was only eight inches thick including both the upper and lower scoriaceous surfaces until examining this section i had not thought it possible that lava could have flowed in such uniformly thin sheets over a surface far from smooth these little streams closely resemble in composition that great deluge of lava at albemarle island which likewise must have possessed a high degree of fluidity pseudoextraneous ejected fragmentsin the lava and in the scoriæ of this little crater i found several fragments which from their angular form their granular structure their freedom from aircells their brittle and burnt condition closely resembled those fragments of primary rocks which are occasionally ejected as at ascension from volcanos these fragments consist of glassy albite much mackled and with very imperfect cleavages mingled with semirounded grains having tarnished glossy surfaces of a steelblue mineral the crystals of albite are coated by a red oxide of iron appearing like a residual substance and their cleavageplanes also are sometimes separated by excessively fine layers of this oxide giving to the crystals the appearance of being ruled like a glass micrometer there was no quartz the steelblue mineral which is abundant in the pinnacle but which disappears in the streams derived from the pinnacle has a fused appearance and rarely presents even a trace of cleavage i obtained however one measurement which proved that it was augite and in one other fragment which differed from the others in being slightly cellular and in gradually blending into the surrounding matrix the small grains of this mineral were tolerably well crystallised although there is so wide a difference in appearance between the lava of the little streams and especially of their red scoriaceous crusts and one of these angular ejected fragments which at first sight might readily be mistaken for syenite yet i believe that the lava has originated from the melting and movement of a mass of rock of absolutely similar composition with the fragments besides the specimen above alluded to in which we see a fragment becoming slightly cellular and blending into the surrounding matrix some of the grains of the steelblue augite also have their surfaces becoming very finely vesicular and passing into the nature of the surrounding paste other grains are throughout in an intermediate condition the paste seems to consist of the augite more perfectly fused or more probably merely disturbed in its softened state by the movement of the mass and mingled with the oxide of iron and with finely comminuted glassy albite hence probably it is that the fused albite which is abundant in the pinnacle disappears in the streams the albite is in exactly the same state with the exception of most of the crystals being smaller in the lava and in the embedded fragments but in the fragments they appear to be less abundant this however would naturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base and its consequent apparent increase in bulk it is interesting thus to trace the steps by which a compact granular rock becomes converted into a vesicular pseudoporphyritic lava and finally into red scoriæ the structure and composition of the embedded fragments show that they are parts either of a mass of primary rock which has undergone considerable change from volcanic action or more probably of the crust of a body of cooled and crystallised lava which has afterwards been broken up and reliquefied the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and movement concluding remarks on the tuffcratersthese craters from the peculiarity of the resinlike substance which enters largely into their composition from their structure their size and number present the most striking feature in the geology of this archipelago the majority of them form either separate islets or promontories attached to the larger islands and those which now stand at some little distance from the coast are worn and breached as if by the action of the sea from this general circumstance of their position and from the small quantity of ejected ashes in any part of the archipelago i am led to conclude that the tuff has been chiefly produced by the grinding together of fragments of lava within active craters communicating with the sea in the origin and composition of the tuff and in the frequent presence of a central lake of brine and of layers of salt these craters resemble though on a gigantic scale the salses or hillocks of mud which are common in some parts of italy and in other countries their closer connection however in this archipelago with ordinary volcanic action is shown by the pools of solidified basalt with which they are sometimes filled up it at first appears very singular that all the craters formed of tuff have their southern sides either quite broken down and wholly removed or much lower than the other sides i saw and received accounts of twentyeight of these craters of these twelve form separate islets and now exist as mere crescents quite open to the south with occasionally a few points of rock marking their former circumference of the remaining sixteen some form promontories and others stand at a little distance inland from the shore but all have their southern sides either the lowest or quite broken down two however of the sixteen had their northern sides also low whilst their eastern and western sides were perfect i did not see or hear of a single exception to the rule of these craters being broken down or low on the side which faces a point of the horizon between se and sw this rule does not apply to craters composed of lava and scoriæ the explanation is simple at this archipelago the waves from the tradewind and the swell propagated from the distant parts of the open ocean coincide in direction which is not the case in many parts of the pacific and with their united forces attack the southern sides of all the islands and consequently the southern slope even when entirely formed of hard basaltic rock is invariably steeper than the northern slope as the tuffcraters are composed of a soft material and as probably all or nearly all have at some period stood immersed in the sea we need not wonder that they should invariably exhibit on their exposed sides the effects of this great denuding power judging from the worn condition of many of these craters it is probable that some have been entirely washed away as there is no reason to suppose that the craters formed of scoriæ and lava were erupted whilst standing in the sea we can see why the rule does not apply to them at ascension it was shown that the mouths of the craters which are there all of terrestrial origin have been affected by the trade wind and this same power might here also aid in making the windward and exposed sides of some of the craters originally the lowest mineralogical composition of the rocksin the northern islands the basaltic lavas seem generally to contain more albite than they do in the southern half of the archipelago but almost all the streams contain some the albite is not unfrequently associated with olivine i did not observe in any specimen distinguishable crystals of hornblende or augite i except the fused grains in the ejected fragments and in the pinnacle of the little crater above described i did not meet with a single specimen of true trachyte though some of the paler lavas when abounding with large crystals of the harsh and glassy albite resemble in some degree this rock but in every case the basis fuses into a black enamel beds of ashes and farejected scoriæ as previously stated are almost absent nor did i see a fragment of obsidian or of pumice von buch believes that the absence of pumice on mount etna is consequent on the feldspar being of the labrador variety if the presence of pumice depends on the constitution of the feldspar it is remarkable that it should be absent in this archipelago and abundant in the cordillera of south america in both of which regions the feldspar is of the albitic variety owing to the absence of ashes and the general indecomposable character of the lava in this archipelago the islands are slowly clothed with a poor vegetation and the scenery has a desolate and frightful aspect elevation of the landproofs of the rising of the land are scanty and imperfect at chatham island i noticed some great blocks of lava cemented by calcareous matter containing recent shells but they occurred at the height of only a few feet above highwater mark one of the officers gave me some fragments of shells which he found embedded several hundred feet above the sea in the tuff of two craters distant from each other it is possible that these fragments may have been carried up to their present height in an eruption of mud but as in one instance they were associated with broken oystershells almost forming a layer it is more probable that the tuff was uplifted with the shells in mass the specimens are so imperfect that they can be recognised only as belonging to recent marine genera on charles island i observed a line of great rounded blocks piled on the summit of a vertical cliff at the height of fifteen feet above the line where the sea now acts during the heaviest gales this appeared at first good evidence in favour of the elevation of the land but it was quite deceptive for i afterwards saw on an adjoining part of this same coast and heard from eyewitnesses that wherever a recent stream of lava forms a smooth inclined plane entering the sea the waves during gales have the power of rolling up rounded blocks to a great height above the line of their ordinary action as the little cliff in the foregoing case is formed by a stream of lava which before being worn back must have entered the sea with a gently sloping surface it is possible or rather it is probable that the rounded boulders now lying on its summit are merely the remnant of those which had been rolled up during storms to their present height direction of the fissures of eruptionthe volcanic orifices in this group cannot be considered as indiscriminately scattered three great craters on albemarle island form a well marked line extending nw by n and se by s narborough island and the great crater on the rectangular projection of albemarle island form a second parallel line to the east hoods island and the islands and rocks between it and james island form another nearly parallel line which when prolonged includes culpepper and wenman islands lying seventy miles to the north the other islands lying farther eastward form a less regular fourth line several of these islands and the vents on albemarle island are so placed that they likewise fall on a set of rudely parallel lines intersecting the former lines at right angles so that the principal craters appear to lie on the points where two sets of fissures cross each other the islands themselves with the exception of albemarle island are not elongated in the same direction with the lines on which they stand the direction of these islands is nearly the same with that which prevails in so remarkable a manner in the numerous archipelagos of the great pacific ocean finally i may remark that amongst the galapagos islands there is no one dominant vent much higher than all the others as may be observed in many volcanic archipelagos the highest is the great mound on the southwestern extremity of albemarle island which exceeds by barely a thousand feet several other neighbouring craters chapter vi trachyte

central volcanos of von buch doubtfulvolcanic islands bordering continentsantiquity of volcanic islands and their elevation in masseruptions on parallel lines of fissure within the same geological period on the separation of the constituent minerals of lava according to their specific gravitiesone side of freshwater bay in james island is formed by the wreck of a large crater mentioned in the last chapter of which the interior has been filled up by a pool of basalt about feet in thickness this basalt is of a gray colour and contains many crystals of glassy albite which become much more numerous in the lower scoriaceous part this is contrary to what might have been expected for if the crystals had been originally disseminated in equal numbers the greater intumescence of this lower scoriaceous part would have made them appear fewer in number von buch has described a stream of obsidian on the peak of teneriffe in which the crystals of feldspar become more and more numerous as the depth or thickness increases so that near the lower surface of the stream the lava even resembles a primary rock von buch further states that m drée in his experiments in melting lava found that the crystals of feldspar always tended to precipitate themselves to the bottom of the crucible in these cases i presume there can be no doubt that the crystals sink from their weight the specific gravity of feldspar varies from to whilst obsidian seems commonly to be from to and in a fluidified state its specific gravity would probably be less which would facilitate the sinking of the crystals of feldspar at james island the crystals of albite although no doubt of less weight than the gray basalt in the parts where compact might easily be of greater specific gravity than the scoriaceous mass formed of melted lava and bubbles of heated gas the sinking of crystals through a viscid substance like molten rock as is unequivocally shown to have been the case in the experiments of m drée is worthy of further consideration as throwing light on the separation of the trachytic and basaltic series of lavas mr p scrope has speculated on this subject but he does not seem to have been aware of any positive facts such as those above given and he has overlooked one very necessary element as it appears to me in the phenomenonnamely the existence of either the lighter or heavier mineral in globules or in crystals in a substance of imperfect fluidity like molten rock it is hardly credible that the separate infinitely small atoms whether of feldspar augite or of any other mineral would have power from their slightly different gravities to overcome the friction caused by their movement but if the atoms of any one of these minerals became whilst the others remained fluid united into crystals or granules it is easy to perceive that from the lessened friction their sinking or floating power would be greatly increased on the other hand if all the minerals became granulated at the same time it is scarcely possible from their mutual resistance that any separation could take place a valuable practical discovery illustrating the effect of the granulation of one element in a fluid mass in aiding its separation has lately been made when lead containing a small proportion of silver is constantly stirred whilst cooling it becomes granulated and the grains or imperfect crystals of nearly pure lead sink to the bottom leaving a residue of melted metal much richer in silver whereas if the mixture be left undisturbed although kept fluid for a length of time the two metals show no signs of separating the sole use of the stirring seems to be the formation of detached granules the specific gravity of silver is and of lead the granulated lead which sinks is never absolutely pure and the residual fluid metal contains when richest only part of silver as the difference in specific gravity caused by the different proportions of the two metals is so exceedingly small the separation is probably aided in a great degree by the difference in gravity between the lead when granular though still hot and when fluid in a body of liquefied volcanic rock left for some time without any violent disturbance we might expect in accordance with the above facts that if one of the constituent minerals became aggregated into crystals or granules or had been enveloped in this state from some previously existing mass such crystals or granules would rise or sink according to their specific gravity now we have plain evidence of crystals being embedded in many lavas whilst the paste or basis has continued fluid i need only refer as instances to the several great pseudoporphyritic streams at the galapagos islands and to the trachytic streams in many parts of the world in which we find crystals of feldspar bent and broken by the movement of the surrounding semifluid matter lavas are chiefly composed of three varieties of feldspar varying in specific gravity from to of hornblende and augite varying from to of olivine varying from to and lastly of oxides of iron with specific gravities from to hence crystals of feldspar enveloped in a mass of liquefied but not highly vesicular lava would tend to rise to the upper parts and crystals or granules of the other minerals thus enveloped would tend to sink we ought not however to expect any perfect degree of separation in such viscid materials trachyte which consists chiefly of feldspar with some hornblende and oxide of iron has a specific gravity of about whilst basalt composed chiefly of augite and feldspar often with much iron and olivine has a gravity of about accordingly we find that where both trachytic and basaltic streams have proceeded from the same orifice the trachytic streams have generally been first erupted owing as we must suppose to the molten lava of this series having accumulated in the upper parts of the volcanic focus this order of eruption has been observed by beudant scrope and by other authors three instances also have been given in this volume as the later eruptions however from most volcanic mountains burst through their basal parts owing to the increased height and weight of the internal column of molten rock we see why in most cases only the lower flanks of the central trachytic masses are enveloped by basaltic streams the separation of the ingredients of a mass of lava would perhaps sometimes take place within the body of a volcanic mountain if lofty and of great dimensions instead of within the underground focus in which case trachytic streams might be poured forth almost contemporaneously or at short recurrent intervals from its summit and basaltic streams from its base this seems to have taken place at teneriffe i need only further remark that from violent disturbances the separation of the two series even under otherwise favourable conditions would naturally often be prevented and likewise their usual order of eruption be inverted from the high degree of fluidity of most basaltic lavas these perhaps alone would in many cases reach the surface as we have seen that crystals of feldspar in the instance described by von buch sink in obsidian in accordance with their known greater specific gravity we might expect to find in every trachytic district where obsidian has flowed as lava that it had proceeded from the upper or highest orifices this according to von buch holds good in a remarkable manner both at the lipari islands and on the peak of teneriffe at this latter place obsidian has never flowed from a less height than feet obsidian also appears to have been erupted from the loftiest peaks of the peruvian cordillera i will only further observe that the specific gravity of quartz varies from to and therefore that when present in a volcanic focus it would not tend to sink with the basaltic bases and this perhaps explains the frequent presence and the abundance of this mineral in the lavas of the trachytic series as observed in previous parts of this volume an objection to the foregoing theory will perhaps be drawn from the plutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently distinct series of different specific gravities although like the volcanic they have been liquefied in answer it may first be remarked that we have no evidence of the atoms of any one of the constituent minerals in the plutonic series having been aggregated whilst the others remained fluid which we have endeavoured to show is an almost necessary condition of their separation on the contrary the crystals have generally impressed each other with their forms in the second place the perfect tranquillity under which it is probable that the plutonic masses buried at profound depths have cooled would most likely be highly unfavourable to the separation of their constituent minerals for if the attractive force which during the progressive cooling draws together the molecules of the different minerals has power sufficient to keep them together the friction between such halfformed crystals or pasty globules would effectually prevent the heavier ones from sinking or the lighter ones from rising on the other hand a small amount of disturbance which would probably occur in most volcanic foci and which we have seen does not prevent the separation of granules of lead from a mixture of molten lead and silver or crystals of feldspar from streams of lava by breaking and dissolving the less perfectly formed globules would permit the more perfect and therefore unbroken crystals to sink or rise according to their specific gravity although in plutonic rocks two distinct species corresponding to the trachytic and basaltic series do not exist i much suspect that a certain amount of separation of their constituent parts has often taken place i suspect this from having observed how frequently dikes of greenstone and basalt intersect widely extended formations of granite and the allied metamorphic rocks i have never examined a district in an extensive granitic region without discovering dikes i may instance the numerous trapdikes in several districts of brazil chile and australia and at the cape of good hope many dikes likewise occur in the great granitic tracts of india in the north of europe and in other countries whence then has the greenstone and basalt forming these dikes come are we to suppose like some of the elder geologists that a zone of trap is uniformly spread out beneath the granitic series which composes as far as we know the foundations of the earths crust is it not more probable that these dikes have been formed by fissures penetrating into partially cooled rocks of the granitic and metamorphic series and by their more fluid parts consisting chiefly of hornblende oozing out and being sucked into such fissures at bahia in brazil in a district composed of gneiss and primitive greenstone i saw many dikes of a dark augitic for one crystal certainly was of this mineral or hornblendic rock which as several appearances clearly proved either had been formed before the surrounding mass had become solid or had together with it been afterwards thoroughly softened on both sides of one of these dikes the gneiss was penetrated to the distance of several yards by numerous curvilinear threads or streaks of dark matter which resembled in form clouds of the class called cirrhicomæ some few of these threads could be traced to their junction with the dike when examining them i doubted whether such hairlike and curvilinear veins could have been injected and i now suspect that instead of having been injected from the dike they were its feeders if the foregoing view of the origin of trapdikes in widely extended granitic regions far from rocks of any other formation be admitted as probable we may further admit in the case of a great body of plutonic rock being impelled by repeated movements into the axis of a mountainchain that its more liquid constituent parts might drain into deep and unseen abysses afterwards perhaps to be brought to the surface under the form either of injected masses of greenstone and augitic porphyry or of basaltic eruptions much of the difficulty which geologists have experienced when they have compared the composition of volcanic with plutonic formations will i think be removed if we may believe that most plutonic masses have been to a certain extent drained of those comparatively weighty and easily liquefied elements which compose the trappean and basaltic series of rocks on the distribution of volcanic islandsduring my investigations on coralreefs i had occasion to consult the works of many voyagers and i was invariably struck with the fact that with rare exceptions the innumerable islands scattered throughout the pacific indian and atlantic oceans were composed either of volcanic or of modern coral rocks it would be tedious to give a long catalogue of all the volcanic islands but the exceptions which i have found are easily enumerated in the atlantic we have st pauls rock described in this volume and the falkland islands composed of quartz and clayslate but these latter islands are of considerable size and lie not very far from the south american coast in the indian ocean the seychelles situated in a line prolonged from madagascar consist of granite and quartz in the pacific ocean new caledonia an island of large size belongs as far as is known to the primary class new zealand which contains much volcanic rock and some active volcanos from its size cannot be classed with the small islands which we are now considering the presence of a small quantity of nonvolcanic rock as of clayslate on three of the azores or of tertiary limestone at madeira or of clayslate at chatham island in the pacific or of lignite at kerguelen land ought not to exclude such islands or archipelagos if formed chiefly of erupted matter from the volcanic class the composition of the numerous islands scattered through the great oceans being with such rare exceptions volcanic is evidently an extension of that law and the effect of those same causes whether chemical or mechanical from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanos now in action stand either as islands in the sea or near its shores this fact of the oceanislands being so generally volcanic is also interesting in relation to the nature of the mountainchains on our continents which are comparatively seldom volcanic and yet we are led to suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean once extended do volcanic eruptions we may ask reach the surface more readily through fissures formed during the first stages of the conversion of the bed of the ocean into a tract of land looking at the charts of the numerous volcanic archipelagos we see that the islands are generally arranged either in single double or triple rows in lines which are frequently curved in a slight degree each separate island is either rounded or more generally elongated in the same direction with the group in which it stands but sometimes transversely to it some of the groups which are not much elongated present little symmetry in their forms m virlet states that this is the case with the grecian archipelago in such groups i suspect for i am aware how easy it is to deceive oneself on these points that the vents are generally arranged on one line or on a set of short parallel lines intersecting at nearly right angles another line or set of lines the galapagos archipelago offers an example of this structure for most of the islands and the chief orifices on the largest island are so grouped as to fall on a set of lines ranging about nw by n and on another set ranging about wsw in the canary archipelago we have a simpler structure of the same kind in the cape de verde group which appears to be the least symmetrical of any oceanic volcanic archipelago a nw and se line formed by several islands if prolonged would intersect at right angles a curved line on which the remaining islands are placed von buch has classed all volcanos under two heads namely central volcanos round which numerous eruptions have taken place on all sides in a manner almost regular and volcanic chains in the examples given of the first class as far as position is concerned i can see no grounds for their being called central and the evidence of any difference in mineralogical nature between central volcanos and volcanic chains appears slight no doubt some one island in most small volcanic archipelagos is apt to be considerably higher than the others in a similar manner whatever the cause may be that on the same island one vent is generally higher than all the others von buch does not include in his class of volcanic chains small archipelagos in which the islands are admitted by him as at the azores to be arranged in lines but when viewing on a map of the world how perfect a series exists from a few volcanic islands placed in a row to a train of linear archipelagos following each other in a straight line and so on to a great wall like the cordillera of america it is difficult to believe that there exists any essential difference between short and long volcanic chains von buch states that his volcanic chains surmount or are closely connected with mountainranges of primary formation but if trains of linear archipelagos are in the course of time by the longcontinued action of the elevatory and volcanic forces converted into mountainranges it would naturally result that the inferior primary rocks would often be uplifted and brought into view some authors have remarked that volcanic islands occur scattered though at very unequal distances along the shores of the great continents as if in some measure connected with them in the case of juan fernandez situated miles from the coast of chile there was undoubtedly a connection between the volcanic forces acting under this island and under the continent as was shown during the earthquake of the islands moreover of some of the small volcanic groups which thus border continents are placed in lines related to those along which the adjoining shores of the continents trend i may instance the lines of intersection at the galapagos and at the cape de verde archipelagos and the best marked line of the canary islands if these facts be not merely accidental we see that many scattered volcanic islands and small groups are related not only by proximity but in the direction of the fissures of eruption to the neighbouring continentsa relation which von buch considers characteristic of his great volcanic chains in volcanic archipelagos the orifices are seldom in activity on more than one island at a time and the greater eruptions usually recur only after long intervals observing the number of craters that are usually found on each island of a group and the vast amount of matter which has been erupted from them one is led to attribute a high antiquity even to those groups which appear like the galapagos to be of comparatively recent origin this conclusion accords with the prodigious amount of degradation by the slow action of the sea which their originally sloping coasts must have suffered when they are worn back as is so often the case into grand precipices we ought not however to suppose in hardly any instance that the whole body of matter forming a volcanic island has been erupted at the level on which it now stands the number of dikes which seem invariably to intersect the interior parts of every volcano show on the principles explained by m elie de beaumont that the whole mass has been uplifted and fissured a connection moreover between volcanic eruptions and contemporaneous elevations in mass has i think been shown to exist in my work on coral reefs both from the frequent presence of upraised organic remains and from the structure of the accompanying coralreefs finally i may remark that in the same archipelago eruptions have taken place within the historical period on more than one of the parallel lines of fissure thus at the galapagos archipelago eruptions have taken place from a vent on narborough island and from one on albemarle island which vents do not fall on the same line at the canary islands eruptions have taken place in teneriffe and lanzarote and at the azores on the three parallel lines of pico st jorge and terceira believing that a mountainaxis differs essentially from a volcano only in plutonic rocks having been injected instead of volcanic matter having been ejected this appears to me an interesting circumstance for we may infer from it as probable that in the elevation of a mountainchain two or more of the parallel lines forming it may be upraised and injected

zealand australia van diemens land and the cape of good hope in order to confine the second part of these geological observations to south america i will here briefly describe all that i observed at these places worthy of the attention of geologists new south walesmy opportunities of observation consisted of a ride of ninety geographical miles to bathurst in a wnw direction from sydney the first thirty miles from the coast passes over a sandstone country broken up in many places by traprocks and separated by a bold escarpment overhanging the river nepean from the great sandstone platform of the blue mountains this upper platform is feet high at the edge of the escarpment and rises in a distance of twentyfive miles to between and feet above the level of the sea at this distance the road descends to a country rather less elevated and composed in chief part of primary rocks there is much granite in one part passing into a red porphyry with octagonal crystals of quartz and intersected in some places by trapdikes near the downs of bathurst i passed over much palebrown glossy clayslate with the shattered laminæ running north and south i mention this fact because captain king informs me that in the country a hundred miles southward near lake george the micaslate ranges so invariably north and south that the inhabitants take advantage of it in finding their way through the forests the sandstone of the blue mountains is at least feet thick and in some parts is apparently of greater thickness it consists of small grains of quartz cemented by white earthy matter and it abounds with ferruginous veins the lower beds sometimes alternate with shales and coal at wolgan i found in carbonaceous shale leaves of the glossopteris brownii a fern which so frequently accompanies the coal of australia the sandstone contains pebbles of quartz and these generally increase in number and size seldom however exceeding an inch or two in diameter in the upper beds i observed a similar circumstance in the grand sandstone formation at the cape of good hope on the south american coast where tertiary and supratertiary beds have been extensively elevated i repeatedly noticed that the uppermost beds were formed of coarser materials than the lower this appears to indicate that as the sea became shallower the force of the waves or currents increased on the lower platform however between the blue mountains and the coast i observed that the upper beds of the sandstone frequently passed into argillaceous shalethe effect probably of this lower space having been protected from strong currents during its elevation the sandstone of the blue mountains evidently having been of mechanical origin and not having suffered any metamorphic action i was surprised at observing that in some specimens nearly all the grains of quartz were so perfectly crystallised with brilliant facets that they evidently had not in their present form been aggregated in any previously existing rock it is difficult to imagine how these crystals could have been formed one can hardly believe that they were separately precipitated in their present crystallised state is it possible that rounded grains of quartz may have been acted on by a fluid corroding their surfaces and depositing on them fresh silica i may remark that in the sandstone formation of the cape of good hope it is evident that silica has been profusely deposited from aqueous solution in several parts of the sandstone i noticed patches of shale which might at the first glance have been mistaken for extraneous fragments their horizontal laminæ however being parallel with those of the sandstone showed that they were the remnants of thin continuous beds one such fragment probably the section of a long narrow strip seen in the face of a cliff was of greater vertical thickness than breadth which proves that this bed of shale must have been in some slight degree consolidated after having been deposited and before being worn away by the currents each patch of the shale shows also how slowly many of the successive layers of sandstone were deposited these pseudofragments of shale will perhaps explain in some cases the origin of apparently extraneous fragments in crystalline metamorphic rocks i mention this because i found near rio de janeiro a welldefined angular fragment seven yards long by two yards in breadth of gneiss containing garnets and mica in layers enclosed in the ordinary stratified porphyritic gneiss of the country the laminæ of the fragment and of the surrounding matrix ran in exactly the same direction but they dipped at different angles i do not wish to affirm that this singular fragment a solitary case as far as i know was originally deposited in a layer like the shale in the blue mountains between the strata of the porphyritic gneiss before they were metamorphosed but there is sufficient analogy between the two cases to render such an explanation possible stratification of the escarpmentthe strata of the blue mountains appear to the eye horizontal but they probably have a similar inclination with the surface of the platform which slopes from the west towards the escarpment over the nepean at an angle of one degree or of one hundred feet in a mile the strata of the escarpment dip almost conformably with its steeply inclined face and with so much regularity that they appear as if thrown into their present position but on a more careful examination they are seen to thicken and to thin out and in the upper part to be succeeded and almost capped by horizontal beds these appearances render it probable that we here see an original escarpment not formed by the sea having eaten back into the strata but by the strata having originally extended only thus far those who have been in the habit of examining accurate charts of seacoasts where sediment is accumulating will be aware that the surfaces of the banks thus formed generally slope from the coast very gently towards a certain line in the offing beyond which the depth in most cases suddenly becomes great i may instance the great banks of sediment within the west indian archipelago which terminate in submarine slopes inclined at angles of between and degrees and sometimes even at more than degrees every one knows how steep such a slope would appear on the land banks of this nature if uplifted would probably have nearly the same external form as the platform of the blue mountains where it abruptly terminates over the nepean current cleavagethe strata of sandstone in the low coast country and likewise on the blue mountains are often divided by cross or current laminæ which dip in different directions and frequently at an angle of fortyfive degrees most authors have attributed these cross layers to successive small accumulations on an inclined surface but from a careful examination in some parts of the new red sandstone of england i believe that such layers generally form parts of a series of curves like gigantic tidal ripples the tops of which have since been cut off either by nearly horizontal layers or by another set of great ripples the folds of which do not exactly coincide with those below them it is well known to surveyors that mud and sand are disturbed during storms at considerable depths at least from to feet so that the nature of the bottom even becomes temporarily changed the bottom also at a depth between and feet has been observed to be broadly rippled one may therefore be allowed to suspect from the appearances just mentioned in the new red sandstone that at greater depths the bed of the ocean is heaped up during gales into great ripplelike furrows and depressions which are afterwards cut off by the currents during more tranquil weather and again furrowed during gales valleys in the sandstone platformsthe grand valleys by which the blue mountains and the other sandstone platforms of this part of australia are penetrated and which long offered an insuperable obstacle to the attempts of the most enterprising colonist to reach the interior country form the most striking feature in the geology of new south wales they are of grand dimensions and are bordered by continuous lines of lofty cliffs it is not easy to conceive a more magnificent spectacle than is presented to a person walking on the summitplains when without any notice he arrives at the brink of one of these cliffs which are so perpendicular that he can strike with a stone as i have tried the trees growing at the depth of between and feet below him on both hands he sees headland beyond headland of the receding line of cliff and on the opposite side of the valley often at the distance of several miles he beholds another line rising up to the same height with that on which he stands and formed of the same horizontal strata of pale sandstone the bottoms of these valleys are moderately level and the fall of the rivers flowing in them according to sir t mitchell is gentle the main valleys often send into the platform great baylike arms which expand at their upper ends and on the other hand the platform often sends promontories into the valley and even leaves in them great almost insulated masses so continuous are the bounding lines of cliff that to descend into some of these valleys it is necessary to go round twenty miles and into others the surveyors have only lately penetrated and the colonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle but the most remarkable point of structure in these valleys is that although several miles wide in their upper parts they generally contract towards their mouths to such a degree as to become impassable the surveyorgeneral sir t mitchell in vain endeavoured first on foot and then by crawling between the great fallen fragments of sandstone to ascend through the gorge by which the river grose joins the nepean yet the valley of the grose in its upper part as i saw forms a magnificent basin some miles in width and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs the summits of which are believed to be nowhere less than feet above the level of the sea when cattle are driven into the valley of the wolgan by a path which i descended partly cut by the colonists they cannot escape for this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs and eight miles lower down it contracts from an average width of half a mile to a mere chasm impassable to man or beast sir t mitchell states that the great valley of the cox river with all its branches contracts where it unites with the nepean into a gorge yards wide and about feet in depth other similar cases might have been added the first impression from seeing the correspondence of the horizontal strata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrelike depressions is that they have been in chief part hollowed out like other valleys by aqueous erosion but when one reflects on the enormous amount of stone which on this view must have been removed in most of the above cases through mere gorges or chasms one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided but considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys and of the narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms we are compelled to abandon this notion to attribute these hollows to alluvial action would be preposterous nor does the drainage from the summitlevel always fall as i remarked near the weatherboard into the head of these valleys but into one side of their baylike recesses some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never viewed one of these baylike recesses with the headlands receding on both hands without being struck with their resemblance to a bold seacoast this is certainly the case moreover the numerous fine harbours with their widely branching arms on the present coast of new south wales which are generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth from one mile to a quarter of a mile in width passing through the sandstone coastcliffs present a likeness though on a miniature scale to the great valleys of the interior but then immediately occurs the startling difficulty why has the sea worn out these great though circumscribed depressions on a wide platform and left mere gorges through which the whole vast amount of triturated matter must have been carried away the only light i can throw on this enigma is by showing that banks appear to be forming in some seas of the most irregular forms and that the sides of such banks are so steep as before stated that a comparatively small amount of subsequent erosion would form them into cliffs that the waves have power to form high and precipitous cliffs even in landlocked harbours i have observed in many parts of south america in the red sea banks with an extremely irregular outline and composed of sediment are penetrated by the most singularly shaped creeks with narrow mouths this is likewise the case though on a larger scale with the bahama banks such banks i have been led to suppose have been formed by currents heaping sediment on an irregular bottom that in some cases the sea instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet heaps it round submarine rocks and islands it is hardly possible to doubt after having examined the charts of the west indies to apply these ideas to the sandstone platforms of new south wales i imagine that the strata might have been heaped on an irregular bottom by the action of strong currents and of the undulations of an open sea and that the valleylike spaces thus left unfilled might during a slow elevation of the land have had their steeply sloping flanks worn into cliffs the worndown sandstone being removed either at the time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea or subsequently by alluvial action van diemens land the southern part of this island is mainly formed of mountains of greenstone which often assumes a syenitic character and contains much hypersthene these mountains in their lower half are generally encased by strata containing numerous small corals and some shells these shells have been examined by mr g b sowerby and are described in the appendix they consist of two species of producta and of six of spirifera two of these namely p rugata and s rotundata resemble as far as their imperfect condition allows of comparison british mountainlimestone shells mr lonsdale has had the kindness to examine the corals they consist of six undescribed species belonging to three genera species of these genera occur in the silurian devonian and carboniferous strata of europe mr lonsdale remarks that all these fossils have undoubtedly a palæozoic character and that probably they correspond in age to a division of the system above the silurian formations the strata containing these remains are singular from the extreme variability of their mineralogical composition every intermediate form is present between flintyslate clayslate passing into graywacke pure limestone sandstone and porcellanic rock and some of the beds can only be described as composed of a siliceocalcareoclayslate the formation as far as i could judge is at least a thousand feet in thickness the upper few hundred feet usually consist of a siliceous sandstone containing pebbles and no organic remains the inferior strata of which a pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant are the most variable and these chiefly abound with the remains between two beds of hard crystalline limestone near newtown a layer of white soft calcareous matter is quarried and is used for whitewashing houses from information given to me by mr frankland the surveyorgeneral it appears that this palæozoic formation is found in different parts of the whole island from the same authority i may add that on the northeastern coast and in bass straits primary rocks extensively occur the shores of storm bay are skirted to the height of a few hundred feet by strata of sandstone containing pebbles of the formation just described with its characteristic fossils and
