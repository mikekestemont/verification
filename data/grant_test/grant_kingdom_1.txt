an essay on the study of the animal kingdom being an introductory lecture delivered in the university of london on the rd of october by robert e grant md in this introductory discourse the objects and limits of comparative anatomy comparative physiology and zoology are defined the extent and distribution of the animal kingdom are briefly described and the connections of the study of animals with other branches of science are pointed out the various uses of animals to man and in the economy of nature are enumerated and also the pleasures and advantages derived from their study the lecture concludes with an outline of the course of comparative anatomy and zoology to be delivered in the university of london gentlemen the object of this course of lectures is to demonstrate the structure of animals to explain their functions to detail their history and uses and to illustrate the principles of their classification these subjects constitute the departments of physical science termed comparative anatomy or zootomy comparative physiology and zoology which treat of the forms the mechanism the properties the phenomena and the relations of all the existing and extinct species of animals known upon the earth the word zootomy is employed to express the knowledge acquired by dissecting the bodies of animals this science makes us acquainted with their organization or with the structure and form of all their internal parts and organs it points out the connexions which subsist between the different parts of the animal machine by which they are all enabled to cooperate towards the same great objectsthe preservation of the individual and the continuance of the race it examines the changes which the organs undergo at different periods of life to suit them for the various stages of infancy maturity and decay it traces the modifications of form and structure presented by the different organs and parts of the machine in all the inferior tribes of animals by which the whole organization of the species is always admirably adapted to the circumstances in which they are placed it points out the regular gradation in the forms of individual organs from their highly complicated and elaborate structure in quadrupeds to their simplest forms and their total disappearance in the lower orders it shows that notwithstanding the highly complicated organization we observe in the more perfect animals and the intimate connexion which subsists between all their parts not one of all their organs is universal in the animal kingdom or essential to the phenomena of animal life the whole skeleton the solid framework of the body destined to give strength form and support to the entire machine disappears in the class of molluscous animalsas in the doris tritonia eolis c the muscular system so essential to all the voluntary and involuntary movements of the higher classes entirely disappears in the class of radiated animals and with it every trace of nervous system which we are apt to suppose essentially connected with all the motions and functions of animals the brain so intimately connected with the phenomena of mind after dwindling into the form of a few separate ganglia placed on the oesophagus and connected only with the function of digestion disappears from the animal kingdom the heart the great centre of the circulation after diminishing successively the number of its cavities from four to one in the higher classes of animals disappears among insects the bloodvessels also cease to exist and with them all circulating motion of the blood as in most radiated animals and in the whole class of zoophytes the function of respiration is intimately connected with the circulation of the blood and its organs after undergoing various modifications of form suited to the different media in which the animals live cease to belong to the system although the function of secretion is performed by animals very low in the scale all distinct glandular organs for its performance are lost long before the total disappearance of an internal digestive cavity many of the lowest zoophytes which have no internal digestive sac and no polypi which are only superficial digestive cavities absorb their whole nourishment by the surface of their body or by the parietes of canals which traverse their interior the simplest gelatinous animalcules which possess no internal cavity are also reduced to superficial absorption and thus form a transition to the mode of nourishment of the vegetable kingdom besides describing the structure of all the inferior animals and the changes which the organs and textures undergo at different periods of life this branch of anatomy examines the nature of the metamorphoses which various classes of animals undergo before arriving at their perfect state and by comparing the adult organs of the inferior classes with the embryo state of the same organs in the higher orders of animals manv extraordinary analogies are discovered which throw much light on the functions of the parts and serve to unravel the most complicated and difficult forms of organization by tracing back for example the skeleton of fishes to that of quadrupeds and man the true nature and uses of all their complicated arrangement of osseous parts have been discovered and ascertained and by comparing the human brain in the earliest stages of its development with the permanent forms of that organ in quadrupeds birds reptiles and fishes the most singular resemblances have been discovered which throw a new light on the gradual development of that organ in the most perfect animals and on its remarkable structure in the inferior classes by prosecuting these various enquiries the views of the anatomist become enlarged the speculations of the physiologist are corrected or extended and new principles are discovered for the scientific arrangement of the animal kingdom of all animals man has the most elaborate and complicated organization and the structure of his body has been a subject of constant observation and study since the infancy of the human race though debarred from human dissection by superstition in the earliest times the practice of physic and surgery the process of embalming the catastrophes of the field of battle the accidents of common life and the natural curiosity of man as well as the constant habit of examining the structure of the inferior animals had made men acquainted with the leading facts of human anatomy before the period of aristotle who raised it to the dignity of a science and all his successors have endeavoured to extend its bounds the great body of knowledge respecting his internal economy accumulated from the experience of so many ages now forms the subject of many separate branches of science the details of which are conducted with great learning and ability by my distinguished colleagues in this institution the structure and functions of the human body are therefore objects of attention in this place only as the standards of comparison from which we trace the modifications of form throughout all the lower classes of the animal kingdom we compare the organs of the inferior animals with the similar organs of man to determine the extent of their deviation and by watching the result of this change of structure important light is thrown on the functions of the various parts in animals far distant in the zoological scale where similar organs no longer exist we discover analogies of use between parts totally dissimilar in structure which point out their uses in the economy and mutually illustrate their functions from the comparisons thus constantly instituted in all zootomical enquiries this science has been denominated comparative anatomy comparative physiology treats of the functions of the lower animals it considers the organs in a state of action and determines the purposes they are destined to serve in the living economy it makes us acquainted with the uses of all the parts of the inferior animals and investigates the physical causes of all the vital phenomena they exhibit it enquires into the means by which the various motions of animals are effected whether of the whole body from place to place or of voluntary or involuntary parts it examines into the circumstances which modify their sensations and perceptions and discovers the sources of their peculiar instincts and habits it describes the various modes in which the functions of digestion circulation respiration and secretion are performed in the lower classes of animals and the duty assigned to each part of their structure in the performance of these functions it points out the connexion which exists between the forms and mechanism of the various parts and the particular circumstances of each species and the influence of their internal organization over all the phenomena they exhibit it unfolds to our contemplation the inexhaustible resources of nature in the means employed for the propagation of the species from the simple fissiparous generation of animalcules or the almost equally simple gemmiparous mode of zoophytes to the highly complicated viviparous birth of quadrupeds in thus investigating the various functions of the animal economy in all their different stages of simplicity and complication it determines the true nature of animal life and the conditions essential to its existence and discovers the characteristic properties which distinguish animals from the beings belonging to the vegetable and mineral kingdoms and by the successful applications of the principles of chemical and mechanical science to the explanation of their complicated functions it shows that notwithstanding the disturbing forces of the animal economy which have hitherto defied all attempts at generalization the true solution of all vital phenomena and the laws of organized beings are to be looked for in those magnificent arrangements which embrace the whole system of the visible universe the term zoology has long been applied to that branch of natural history which treats of animals it chiefly considers animals in their entire and living state and describes their external forms and distinguishing characters the history of their life and the principles of their scientific arrangement it points out the various external appearances presented by animals and the changes they undergo at particular seasons of the year or at different periods of life it examines the kind of food on which they naturally subsist and the abodes which they frequent whether in the interior or on the surface of the earth or in the atmosphere or in the waters which encompass the globe it makes us acquainted with the remarkable instincts and habits which characterise the different species the climates they inhabit the extent of their geographical distribution and the varieties of form and character which they exhibit in different regions of the earth it describes the periodical or occasional migrations of the different species their comparative numbers and longevity their periods of torpidity and hybernation their seasons of moulting pairing and propagating their periods of gestation their cares for the preservation of the infant progeny the means employed to distribute the species over the globe and the purposes they appear destined to serve in the economy of nature this science enquires into the origin and duration of entire species and the causes which operate towards their increase or their gradual extinction the laws which regulate their distribution and the changes they undergo by the influence of climate domestication and other external circumstances it acquaints us with the uses of animals and of animal substances in medicine agriculture domestic economy and various arts and the means of rearing and domesticating useful species so as to increase their numbers improve their breed or extend their advantages more widely to mankind and it likewise points out the most approved methods of preserving and preparing animals dead or alive for museums menageries transportation microscopical or zootomical observation and other purposes of science utility or recreation it investigates the characters and relations of the extinct races of animals the remains of which are found every where imbedded in the crust of the earth and thus enables us to read in their imperfect and mutilated remains the history of the former inhabitants of this globe it points out to us the order followed in the successive creation of animals as discovered by their fossil remains by their degree of organization and by their relations to the strata of the earth and unfolds the nature of those remarkable revolutions which have repeatedly taken place in the animal kingdom in consequence of sudden or gradual changes in the condition of the surface of this globe the study of these various objects forms a vast and interesting department of knowledge which is intimately connected with the most common wants and enjoyments of man and forms a subject of contemplation peculiarly calculated to gratify improve and elevate the human mind to extend its acquaintance with the sources of happiness immediately around us to store it with useful and practical knowledge to enlarge our views of the wonderful harmony which everywhere pervades the economy of the universe to exalt our conceptions of the infinite wisdom power and goodness of the great author of nature as displayed in his minutest works and thus to lay the most rational and lasting foundations of piety and virtue and strengthen the best principles of morality and religion the animal kingdom which forms the exclusive subject of our study in this place is by far the greatest of the three kingdoms of natural bodies in regard to the number of distinct species which it comprehends and these possess a more complicated and perfect mechanism exhibit a more interesting series of phenomena and have a closer relation to the necessities and enjoyments of man than minerals or plants man himself and all the beings that like him enjoy life motion and feeling are comprehended in this great division of natural bodies more than a thousand species of quadrupeds have been described in zoological works five thousand species of birds and as many species of fishes are now known to naturalists the number and variety of reptiles is immense but as the greater part live in the most concealed situations in tropical deserts in marshes heaths and rivers and as many of them are armed with the most deadly poison this class of animals has been a less favourite object of study fewer of them are known and they still present to the enterprising naturalist a rich field of interesting and important investigation the species of shellfish or testacea crustaceous animals worms radiated animals and zoophytes which almost cover the bottom of the vast abyss exceed all calculation the forms of animalcules vary in almost every infusion of vegetable or animal matter which nature presents or art can form nine hundred species of intestinal worms have already been extracted from the bodies of animals although comparatively little of the attention of naturalists has hitherto been directed to this extraordinary tribe of beings the beautiful forms and colours of insects their interesting habits and economy their extraordinary abundance and the facility of obtaining them their singular metamorphoses their importance to mankind and in the economy of nature have long rendered this class a more popular and attractive object of study and a hundred thousand species of these animals are now known to naturalists a number which exceeds that of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms taken together the number of individuals belonging to the animal kingdom is not less remarkable than the varieties of their form notwithstanding the many obstacles to their increase from the constant warfare between the different species from disease accident the changes of season and the destructive ravages of man the weakness of herbivorous quadrupeds induces them to congregate for protection in large flocks which cover extensive tracts of country both in the old and new world as the deer the sheep the ox the rabbit the hare the paca and many others the numbers are still greater in the class of birds where the vast flocks sometimes darken the heavens like an eclipse as in the wild pigeons of america crows gulls c the number of fishes which people the vast expanse of the ocean may be judged of from the immense shoals of individual species we frequently observe assembled together as of the cod the herring and many other species or from the number of ova they produce at every period of spawning upwards of ova for example have been counted in the spawn of a single carp and more than in that of the flounder we frequently find our coasts covered for miles of extent with a continuous and dense layer of conchiferous or cirrhipedous animals in a living state as with the mussel the oyster the barnacle and their debris accumulated and thrown up by tides and currents of the sea form hills of shells or are collected into extensive beds of some hundred feet in depth the distinguished italian naturalist and traveller donati found the bottom of the adriatic to be composed of a compact bed of shells crustaceous animals and corals not less than six hundred feet in thickness these animals are infinitely more abundant on the tropical shores of the new world and the vast deposits of them found in the interior of the earth show how extensively they peopled the ancient seas myriads of mollusca and conchifera live even beneath the sands of the sea as the cardium the mactra the solen the mya and the natica and the interior of the rocky strata are peopled with living tribes of lithophagous animals as the pholas the teredo the petricola and the saxicava the moving hills of ants the countries laid waste by locusts and the clouds of insects often observed afford some idea of the immense number of individuals which compose the species of this class many radiated animals as medusa actinia and asteria are so numerous that their carcasses accumulated on the shores of the sea are employed to manure the adjacent countries their abundance often changes the colour of vast tracts of the ocean or covers it with a sheet of fire the waters of the arctic seas and the floating cliffs of ice which tower above their surface are often tinged of various hues by different kinds of medusaria so minute that more than a hundred thousand are contained in a cubic foot of water the bottom of the vast abyss is nearly paved with zoophytes which in the southern hemisphere rise up from great depths to form extensive reefs and islands every drop of the ocean from the one pole to the other teems with animalcules and nature has amply provided for all their wants and enjoyments the various classes of animals spread over the globe whether inhabitants of the dry land or of lakes and rivers or of the atmosphere or dispersed through the boundless deep find in the rich and varied clothing of organic matter covering the nakedness of the earth sufficient nourishment not only for their own subsistence and growth and for the continuance and increase of their species but likewise sufficient to enable each individual to support various tribes of parasitic inhabitants innumerable species of insects arachnida and annelides move to and fro on the surface of their bodies feeding on the excreted matters of the skin or sucking the vital fluids from the interior various kinds of ova are deposited matured and hatched under the skin although the animals they contain are not destined to a parasitic life numerous species of worms live and propagate imbedded in the muscular and cellular tissues in the internal cavities and vessels and in the parenchymatous substance even of the best protected organs of the body as in the substance of the liver the spleen the kidneys and the brain itself and various fluids and secretions of the living system contain myriads of infusoria whose singular forms phenomena and modes of generation have been attentively examined and recorded by naturalists every region of the globe presents distinct species of animals the animals of america differ from those of europe those of europe differ from the species of africa and asia and the species of new holland differ from those of all the other continents of the earth every part of the ocean every lake and river and every species of plant on the earth has its particular animated inhabitants the trees of the forest may be distinguished by the insects that inhabit them as animals are known by their parasitic worms and epizoarite from the mole the beaver the rabbit the paca that burrow in the earth or the worms and insects that people its dunnest caverns to the chamois the deer the buctin that bound along the snowclad summits of the mountainsfrom the zoophytes and radiated animals that line the deepest submarine caves or the lithophagous tribes that dig their habitation in the rocks at the bottom of the sea to the eagles that soar above the cloudsfrom the walrus the seal the bear that people the dreary regions of the frigid zone or the gigantic cetacea that gambol beneath the ices of the poles to the ferocious feline tribes that range the sandy deserts of the burning zonethe animal kingdom is distributed over every portion of this planet every element and every situation where life could exist is crowded with animated beings which like ourselves have their feelings their wants and their enjoyments in this vast host of living beings which all start into existence vanish and are renewed in swift succession like the shadows of the clouds in a summers day each species has its peculiar form structure properties and habits adapted to its situation which serve to distinguish it from every other species and each individual has its destined purpose in the economy of nature individuals appear and disappear in rapid succession upon the earth and entire species of animals have their limited duration which is but a moment compared with the antiquity of the globe numberless species and even entire genera and tribes of animals the links which once connected the existing races have long since begun and finished their career and their former existence can now only be recognized by their skeletons embalmed in the soft superficial strata of the earth or by their casts preserved in the more solid rocks of the single genus of shells called ammonites for example upwards of three hundred fossil species have been described and of these a hundred species belong to our own strata yet not a single individual in a living state is now found to inhabit the waters of the globe almost every stratum composing the crust of the globe from the newest alluvial deposits to the oldest transition rocks abounds with the fossil relics of different classes of the animal kingdom from whose remains often mutilated imperfect or extraordinary in their forms the zoologist must learn to decypher the history of the species and discover their relations to the existing races a new and boundless field of inquiry is thus laid open to his investigation in the study of the characters and relations of fossil animalsa study highly interesting to the physiologist as pointing out the successive creation of animal forms and the changes which organization has experienced since the first appearance of animals upon this earth and essential to the geologist as determining the comparative antiquity and the identity of strata and unfolding the nature of those terrible events that have repeatedly broken up the surface of this planet raising the inhabitants of the sea to the summits of lofty mountains and sinking extensive forests with all their animated inhabitants beneath the bed of the ocean the study of the animal kingdom forms an important branch of natural history or that science which treats of the properties and relations of all the natural bodies which can be considered as proper objects of human investigation and it is intimately connected not only with all the other branches of that extensive department of knowledge but likewise with various branches of medicine chemistry agriculture and other sciences and arts the material substances every where surrounding us and which form the objects of natural history are continually acting directly or indirectly on our bodily frame and through its medium on our consciousness to their incessant operation indeed we owe the continuance of our existence and all the enjoyments and pains with which it is replete the external form of the different parts of our body and all our organs of sense relate to the properties of the objects around us the structure of our internal organs and every faculty and instinct we possess have an intimate relation to the objects of the external world the elaborate mechanism of the eye would have been useless without light the ear without the vibrations of the air and the delicate structure of the organ of smell without the odorous emanations of external bodies we have continually recourse to external objects to supply the necessities of the body to repair its losses and to remedy the injuries it sustains we ascribe to impressions received from them all the sensations ideas or states of the consciousness which form the first elements of our knowledge and the materials of all our most complex mental operations they administer to all the wants of the body to the pleasures of sense and to the most refined intellectual enjoyments so that in our present state of being the objects of the material world are intimately connected even with our intellectual existence with all our instincts and passions and with every internal feeling of pleasure or of pain these objects however are very differently related to us by their natural properties some are indifferent to us with regard to pleasure or pain or to the wants of our body others are productive of agreeable sensations or are essential to our existence and others by their noxious qualities are injurious or destructive to our nature and require to be carefully distinguished and avoided the study therefore of the distinguishing properties and the various relations of natural bodies forms a most suitable and important occupation of the human mind by means of our senses we are admitted to an acquaintance with the external world and are enabled to distinguish by their sensible qualities the objects which we ought to pursue from those which are unsuitable to our nature the descriptions of natural history both with relation to the organic and inorganic kingdoms relate to the sensible qualities of bodies and there is this great satisfaction attending all their details that they are founded on observation and experience and their evidence rests on the established laws of thought the description of a natural body whether animal vegetable or mineral consists in an enumeration of its various properties either ascertained by simple observation or discovered by the aid of experiment which is only a more refined mode of observation by the ordinary laws of association our perceptions are grouped together to form that assemblage of properties we ascribe to external bodies and although we have no means of ever discovering any connexion or relation between the immediate objects of our consciousness and the beings to which we refer them we use the descriptive terms red green warm cold sweet bitter and many others without the least ambiguity or impropriety to express the qualities of bodies it is obvious however that they express only sensations which without mind could have no existence in the universe the existence or nonexistence of a substratum connecting the supposed qualities of bodies cannot therefore affect the propriety of the language employed in natural history or the accuracy of its descriptions which provided they correspond with all the ideas produced by the objects described will be equally true whether the objects be in their essence spiritual or material the definite descriptions which natural history requires are applicable only to a small portion of the visible universe the vast distances of the celestial bodies preclude all scientific examination of the materials of which they are composed and the naturalist merely determines the influence they exert on animate and inanimate beings their relations to each other and the grand and interesting phenomena they exhibit their magnitudes and distances and the laws which regulate their stupendous movements belong to the sublime science of astronomy the atmosphere surrounding this earth the waters which cover so large a portion of its surface the solid materials of which the globe is composed and the innumerable organic productions which clothe its surface are the objects which the natural historian examines and describes a knowledge of the composition properties and phenomena of the atmosphere throws much light on the history and functions of animals as this fluid is the great medium through which oxygen heat light electricity and all imponderable agents the great springs of vital phenomena are conveyed to organized beings it unfolds to us the theory of respiration in all terrestrial and aquatic animals and shows the cause of the variety of temperature in the warm and coldblooded classes it explains to us the migrations of animals the theory of their geographical distribution and many of their instincts and habits it illustrates the periodical changes in the plumage of birds and the furs of quadrupeds and the distribution of colours over the animal world the atmosphere is the medium by which sounds and odours are transmitted to sensitive beings and it is intimately connected with irritability the most general and the most inexplicable property of animal matter this fluid is indeed the most essential of all the elements to the continuance of animal life and is abundantly supplied to every individual from the summits of the highest mountains to the greatest depths of the sea the waters of the earth cover threefourths of its surface and support a thousand times more animated beings than people the atmosphere or the dry land the ocean covers vast plains deep valleys and caverns stupendous mountains and precipices rapid gulfs and whirlpools a rich and dense vegetation a world of animals and all the other natural scenery presented by the exposed continents it is the great oxydizing principle of the metallic nucleus of the globe the pabulum of volcanic fires the source of earthquakes and the most powerful agent in the changes continually going on in the interior and on the surface of the earth it gives off the materials of clouds rain snow and hail which give origin to springs rivers lakes glaciers icebergs and many grand and interesting appearances of nature water is the nourishment of the vegetable kingdom and is necessary to the support of most animals a knowledge of that branch of natural history which treats of the waters of the globe is important to the zoologist as explaining the physical and geographical distribution and the habits of aquatic animals it accounts for the showers of animals that frequently fall from the atmosphere as of fishes frogs shells worms c the ova of zoophytes are not like those of fishes fixed by the parent in a situation favourable for their development but are committed like the seeds of marine plants to the mercy of the waves so that their distribution is regulated chiefly by the currents and motions of the sea which hydrography points out the immense body of heated waters borne by the gulf stream through the atlantic from the equator towards the arctic seas conveys with it into high latitudes the temperature of tropical seasa circumstance which enables us to account for the occurrence of animals along its course in latitudes far beyond their natural climate the study of the animal kingdom is inseparably connected with the science of geology no useful information respecting fossil animals can be learned or communicated without some acquaintance with the strata in which they occur and with the general structure of the crust of the earth and the successful study of extraneous fossils requires a very extensive acquaintance with the structure and character of the existing races the nature and history of extinct animals being determined chiefly by a comparison with allied existing species it is by finding accumulations of organic remains spread over successive strata deep in the earth and which must have once lived upon its surface that the geologist has discovered that the crust of this globe must have undergone very great changes in the course of ages and that it must have exhibited many a rich and varied surface crowded with animated inhabitants long anterior to the existence of the busy scene we now contemplate and enjoy anterior to the formation of the transition rocks there appear to have been no animals upon this earth and during the formation of all the transition and secondary strata the animals that existed were almost all marine which shows that these strata were mostly of marine origin and that animal life originated and was developed in the bosom of the deep besides pointing out the order of succession in the formation of the strata and their mode of formation by quiet deposition from a fluid which alone could have preserved the delicate structure of the enclosed relics these remains of animals show what must have been the nature of the situation where we now find them at the period of their deposition whether it formed the bottom of a freshwater lake or the submerged surface of a peopled continent or the bed of a primeval sea and many strata of the earth are characterized by the particular species of fossil animals they contain by thus pointing out the extensive and terrible catastrophes to which the animal kingdom has often been subjected we are enabled to perceive a cause of the many apparent interruptions in the chain of existing species as the knowledge of mountain rocks is founded on an accurate acquaintance with the characters and properties of simple minerals the study of mineralogy is intimately connected with that of organic remains and a previous acquaintance with the practical details of this branch of natural history will greatly facilitate the most intricate and obscure paths of the zoologist he is often unable to obtain any information as to the locality or the geological situation of the fossil animals presented to his inspection and must judge from the nature of the enveloping mass or c of the petrifying substances both concerning the mineral strata in which they were imbedded and the nature of the countries in which they were found the flinty echini most generally indicate the chalk formationa formation which we observe to form low and flat districts on the east coast of england encrinites mineralized with calcareous spar we most frequently find in the limestones of the coal formation which form low and fertile countries varied only by gentle elevations of the strata or interrupted by abrupt projections of trap rocks as in many of the secondary limestone districts of scotland the external aspect of the skeletons of fishes from the paris gypsum formation is very different from that of the freshwater fishes of the bituminous marlslate independent of their zoological characters the branches of natural history we have hitherto mentioned as connected with or illustrative of zoology relate only to bodies of a simple composition and whose phenomena depending on the ordinary affinities of matter exerted at insensible or at perceptible distances admit of rigorous explanation on chemical principles or are regulated by the laws of mechanical philosophy the composition of organized bodies is more complex they assume more regular and determinate forms the affinities of their component elements are more nicely balanced and they exhibit a series of phenomena for a definite period too complicated to be explained in the present state of science either on the principles of chemistry or mechanics from numerous experiments naturalists have been led to believe that the simplest organized bodies as monads and globulina originate spontaneously from matter in a fluid state and that these simple bodies of spontaneous origin are the same with the gelatinous globules which compose the soft parts of animals and plants many of the phenomena of plants as the absorption of moisture by their roots the respiration of the leaves their turning in the direction of the sun and the passage of fluids through their inert tubes are dependant on the common laws of inorganic matter the pulpy matter of ripe fruits has its particles arranged in strict conformity with the laws of crystallization and often possesses a power of double refraction as in the gooseberry and the orange and inthe animal kingdom the same laws operate in the formation of the silicious crystals which compose the skeleton of many zoophytes as the cliona halina leucalia and tethya and the calcareous crystals of many radiated animals as the asterias and echinus this however does not affect the great characters which distinguish organized from inorganic bodies and the vegetable from the animal kingdom organic bodies have an arrangement of internal parts adapted for the transmission of fluids through every part of their structure which enables them to grow by a process of internal developement they subsist on fluids which in vegetables are sucked up by external filaments or roots from the soil in which they are fixed or by their whole external surface as in hydrophytes and in animals the fluid aliment is absorbed from an internal reservoir or stomach by ramified vessels like internal roots or it transudes through the surface of their body as in those animalcules which have no internal cavity the chemical composition and the whole organization of vegetable bodies are more simple than those of animals and their phenomena are more obviously dependant on physical laws their analogies therefore with the complicated mechanism and functions of the human body are very remote and the science of botany which forms an important branch of the healing art owes its high importance and attractions to circumstances totally different from those close analogies which connect the study of animals with the practice and pursuits of medical science the elegant forms and delicate structure of plants the beauty and harmony of their colours and the fragrant odours they exhale the refreshing verdure the variety and the richness which they spread over the face of nature the delicious fruits they yield and the raiment and shelter they afford the interesting series of changes they undergo at different seasons of the year the support they yield to the animal world their various medicinal virtues and their numerous useful applications in domestic economy and the arts have long rendered this branch of natural history a popular and favourite object of study plants afford hemp cotton flax and many other articles employed in forming clothing wood of all natural substances is the most extensively employed in the arts it forms the framework of cities and fleets which are bulwarks of empires and convey population and the productions of commerce over the globe are built of it opium camphor squills belladonna chincona jalap foxglove ipecacuan rhubarb and many other of the most active remedies employed in medicine are derived from plants they yield also many of the most common articles of food and the most favourite dainties of the table spirits wines and the various products of fermentation are derived from vegetable substances there are few plants which do not afford sustenance to some kind of animals and as they grow by absorbing inorganic matter they are a kind of laboratory in which matter is organized to suit it for the digestive organs of animals many plants which are poisonous to one kind of animals are the proper food of another kind numerous species of insects reside and subsist only on particular species of the vegetable kingdom and most of the feathered inhabitants of the air select the seeds and fruits of particular plants the forests of marine plants at the bottom of the sea are covered with animated inhabitants which depend on them for subsistence or cling to them as points of support the animal and vegetable kingdoms are sointimately blended at their origins that naturalists are at present divided in opinion as to the kingdom to which many wellknown substances belongas the codium tomentosum alcyonium bursa the corallina officinalis rubra and opuntia dichotomarite tremella globulina c several organized bodies as oscillatoria conferva and monades which have neither roots nor capillary vessels nor a digestive stomach nor other distinct organs of plants or animals connect the vegetable and animal kingdoms by imperceptible gradations many plants as the cistus helianthemum hedysarum gyrans mimosa pudica and herberts vulgaris exhibit motions similar to those which we ascribe to irritability in animals the study of the almost mechanical functions of plants enables us better to comprehend the mechanism of the complicated functions of animals an acquaintance with the species and history of plants is indispensable to the entomologist and is necessary to the successful study of ornithology it explains to us many of the most remarkable habits of insects and the reasons of the periodical flight of migratory birds over vast tracts of the ocean when we consider indeed the importance of a knowledge of plants in the do mestication of useful animals in the rearing of foreign and domestic species and in illustrating the history and economy of most animals we find that an acquaintance with the vegetable kingdom is calculated to facilitate the path of the zoologist in every department of his investigations in the infancy of botany it was pursued only by medical men and with a view to the medicinal virtues of plants the numerous useful applications and the extended relations of the science however in modern times have raised this interesting study to a high rank in the scale of human knowledge and by the zeal and industry of its cultivators in all parts of the earth nearly seventy thousand species of plants have been discovered and characterised the study of the vegetable kingdom is an inexhaustible source of innocent and rational recreation has given rise to many of the most brilliant and useful productions of human genius and has long been an independent branch of academical instruction in most of the universities of europe although the study of the animal kingdom has not hitherto met with the same fostering care in the established universities of britain it embraces the consideration of a series of beings whose relations to the wants and comforts of man are not less numerous and important than those of plants and it has long been cultivated with advantage and success in the universities of france italy and germany whether indeed we consider animals as affording to man materials for the maintenance and growth of the body or medicines to prevent alleviate or remove its diseases or clothing to protect his frame against the vicissitudes of temperature and the inclemencies of the seasons or physical power to aid him in the operations of art or protection against the attacks and depredations of foes or ornaments to please and cultivate his taste or luxuries to gratify the sense or knowledge extensively applicable to his necessities and enjoyments or an endless source of intellectual amusement and gratification their study forms a department of knowledge which yields to no other in its immediate importance to the existence and happiness of man the form and disposition of the human teeth the structure of the digestive organs the natural instincts and appetites and the results of constant and universal experience show that man was designed to subsist partly on aniihal flesh and almost every class of animals supplies him with abundant and wholesome food the whole class of quadrupeds and almost every part of their body the muscles the brain and spinal cord the lungs the heart the stomach and intestines the liver and pancreas the kidneys the uterus the placenta and udder the skin the fat the marrow and gelatinous substance of the bones the blood and the milk are used as alimentary substances all the species of birds and their eggs afford a wholesome nutriment to man and even their nests are sometimes used as articles of food the flesh and the eggs of many species of reptiles form also esteemed and highly nutritious articles of food several kinds of turtles as the testudoferox lin which abounds in the rivers of south america the testudo graca an inhabitant of africa and sardinia the testudo squamata of java and the testudo europea which is the species most abundantly distributed over the southern countries of europe are prized as dainties of the table some species of the lizard tribe are also used as food both the flesh and eggs of the iguana are eaten some species of the viper are prepared as food and several kinds of frogs are in common use on the continent as delicate articles for the table nearly the whole class of fishes are employed as articles of food and in many parts of the globe they form almost the entire support of extensive populations on the coasts of lapland siberia and the western parts of africa many rude tribes make bread of dried or pounded fishes most of the marine and freshwater molluscous and conchiferous animals afford a wholesome and palatable food and are very extensively used by those who inhabit the shores of the sea the cuttlefish the oyster the mussel the clam the cockle the whelk the limpet and the snail are among those in common use the romans were supplied with oysters from the british coasts numerous crustacea as all the larger species of crabs and lobsters the prawn the shrimp c are extensively employed as articles of diet and as a highly flavoured condiment to more substantial aliment even the classes of insects tunicata and radiata supply articles of nutriment to man the locust is extensively used as an article of food the honey of the bee some species of ascidte and actince and the ovaria of the echinus esculentus are also employed many animals which feed on substances obnoxious to us afford notwithstanding a wholesome nourishment numerous insectivorous quadrupeds subsist entirely on the most loathsome and indigestible insects and worms birds which feed on the most poisonous reptiles and insects yet afford a wholesome flesh and crabs which feed on the most putrid carcasses of fishes yet yield a highly palatable nutriment there is so close a chain of connection and dependence between all the different classes of the animal kingdom that even the lowest may be said to contribute though indirectly to the sustenance of man animalcules are the food of zoophytes which in their turn are consumed by radiated animals and worms these are devoured by crustaceous and molluscous animals which serve as the food of fishes and fishes which are born to a constant warfare feed on each other or are pursued by the amphibious and cetaceous mammalia which inhabit the deep or are seized by the clouds of birds which watch their motions from above or they are dragged from their secret recesses by the artifice of man the different classes of animals generally subsist on those beneath them in the scale of being or they derive their support from the vegetable kingdom so that matter is perpetually advancing to higher states of organization an acquaintance with the composition and the degree of digestibility of alimentary substances derived from the various classes of the animal kingdom would prove an important acquisition to medical science it would greatly extend the powers of the practitioner by enabling him to derive from animal substances nutriment adapted to the various states of the digestive organs in health convalescence debility or disease thus in the class of quadrupeds the muscular parts which consist chiefly of fibrine with a little gelatine and osmazome are the most nutritious the brain and the glandular parts which are composed chiefly of coagulated albumen are less nutritious and the tendons ligaments and membranous parts which consist principally of a condensed gelatine afford the weakest nourishment the animal kingdom not only presents an inexhaustible supply and an endless variety of wholesome food adapted to every state of the constitution to every taste and idiosyncrasy to every age sex and climate but likewise affords many of the most useful and powerful remedies employed in the treatment of disease castor a powerful antispasmodic medicine employed in hysteric affections is a secretion of two glandular sacs which terminate at the prepuce of the beaver the wellknown powerful aromatic substance musk which is extensively used in epilepsy hysteria and other spasmodic diseases is obtained from two glandular sacs placed before the prepuce of the moschus moschiferus an animal like a small goat which inhabits the most dreary rocky summits of the high mountains of india china thibet and other countries in the east of asia spermaceti which is used internally in catarrh and gonorrhoea and externally in ointments to wounds and excoriations of the skin is procured from an unctuous matter filling numerous cartilaginous cavities on the upper part of the head of the cachalot a cetaceous animal as large as a whale which abounds in various parts of the south sea the highly esteemed odoriferous ambergris is an induration of feculent matter found in the large intestine of this animal in a state of disease the crustaceous coverings of crabs which consists of the carbonate and phosphate of lime and certain concretions of a similar composition found in their stomach have long been employed as medicines to remove acidity of the digestive organs and various other calcareous substances derived from the animal kingdom as the burnt shells of the common oyster the eggshells of the domestic fowl and the corallina officinalis have been extensively employed in medicine as antacids these earthly products of organization when levigated and washed with water afford a calcareous powder more free from silicious particles or other impurities than any other form of the carbonate of lime in the article sold by the apothecaries of france under the name of the corallina officinalis lamouroux detected more than a hundred distinct species of calcareous zoophytes which shows how extensively this class of animals is capable of contributing to the articles of the materia medica other zoophytes containing iodine have been employed with great success in the cure of bronchocele and in the removal of chronic glandular tumors particularly in savoy switzerland and other mountainous districts of the continent and are recommended in all the british pharmacopoeias flustroj are used in iceland for the removal of scorbutic affections the horns of the deer when filed down and boiled in water afford a transparent colourless and inodorous jelly which is advantageously employed internally as a demulcent in dysentery and diarrhoea and as a light nutritive article of diet for convalescents the burnt horns of this animal from the quantity of phosphate of lime they contain have been used with much success in rickets and mollifies ossium the phosphate of soda used in medicine as a cathartic is procured by a complicated process from the burnt bones of quadrupeds and phosphoric acid which enters extensively into chemical compounds and from which that remarkably inflammable substance phosphorus is obtained is procured by a chemical process from animal substances empyreumatic animal oil an antispasmodic is obtained by distillation from the bones and horns of animals the basis of sal ammoniac or muriate of ammonia which is used internally as a diuretic and diaphoretic and externally as a discutient to indolent tumors is procured by distillation from the urine and bones of animals from the quantity of ammonia disengaged during the combustion of animal substances the ammoniacal odour is frequently adopted as a test of the animal nature of doubtful organized bodies isinglass which consists of the dried coats of the swimming bag of the sturgeon and several other cartilaginous fishes the adipose substance of the common hog and the wax and honey of the bee are extensively used for medical and pharmaceutic purposes and prussic acid the most powerful of all narcotic substances hitherto discovered is obtained from animal matter in a state of purification scarcely any article employed in medicine or surgery is more extensively beneficial than the spanish fly cantharis vesicatoria both from its external and internal action on the living body these beautiful shining greencoloured insects swarm in the forests on the southern shores of europe feeding on the leaves of the ash and the elder tree and spread a strong and unpleasant odour around them although some insectivorous quadrupeds as the hedgehog can eat large quantities of them with impunity their corrosive action on the human system is so great that they frequently inflame and excoriate the hands of those who are incautious in collecting them and on this corrosive property their chief medicinal virtue dependsin cases of violent visceral inflammation the external use of cantharides as rubifacients or vesicatories cannot be supplied by any other medicine they create a powerful determination to the surface and cause a copious effusion of the serous part of the blood by which the internal action is relieved they have so remarkable a determination to the urinary organs that strangury is sometimes occasioned by their external use and when administered internally they sometimes act so violently on the kidneys and bladder as to induce inflammation of these organs and a discharge of blood from this tendency to excite the urinary organs they are employed in various diseases connected with debility of the urinary and genital systems and likewise as a diuretic in dropsy the leech has been employed in bloodletting for more than two thousand years its medical application is described by themison who wrote before celsus and galen in the time of augustus its use is likewise described by pliny and is celebrated in the lines of horace this small simple vermiform annelide has a dark colour and forbidding aspect and inhabits the foul stagnant marshes and pools of fresh water throughout europe it perforates the skin of animals by its three sharp teeth and by a constant sucking from the wound it fills its body with their blood from the smallness and superficial nature of their wound the mildness and safety of their operation the facility of regulating the quantity of blood they extract and the local nature of the depletion they are in most inflammatory affections more convenient and efficacious than the lancet much safer in their operation and in many cases nothing could supply their place i shall not here make any allusion to the innumerable applications of animals and animal substances to the cure of disease recorded in the writings of the ancients founded for the most part on superstitious notions or on virtues altogether imaginary and which the more scientific principles of modern medicine have entirely discarded from practice they will be found recorded in the natural history of pliny or scattered through the writings of hippocrates galen dioscorides avicenna and other greek and arabian physicians man though the most naked helpless and delicate of animals is the most extensively distributed over the globe and enjoys health and vigour in the torrid temperate and frigid zones from the th degree of north latitude to the th degree south of the equator without fur feathers scales shells or other natural covering he is enabled to endure the most opposite extremes of climate by the remarkably accommodating power of his constitution and by his superior sagacity in devising artificial means to defend his frame against all the vicissitudes of the seasons and the varieties of climate he covers the nakedness of his body with spoils from almost every class of animals the wool the furs and the skins of quadrupeds are manufactured into garments or are worn in their natural state the plumage of birds the scaly coverings of reptiles the skins of crocodiles and even of some fishes and the shells of the inferior tribes are employed to cover his body and in many countries canoes and houses are also covered with the skins of animals in polar regions where the scanty vegetation can supply him neither with clothing nor food the periodical migrations of quadrupeds and birds and the great abundance of the lowest tribes of animals more than supply all his wants the reindeer the polarbear the muskbull the wolf and several other quadrupeds were found by our enterprizing countrymen in the sterile and frozen solitudes of melville island the naturalist who accompanied kotzebue describes the waters of the polar seas as swarming with animal life medusae and zoophytes mollusca and crustacea innumerable species of fishes in incredibly crowded shoals the gigantic swimming mammalia whales physeters dolphins morses and seals fill the sea and its shores and countless flights of waterfowl rock themselves on the bosom of the ocean and in the twilight resemble floating islands the productions of nature are subjected to numerous changes tp suit them for administering to our wants and enjoyments hence have arisen the various arts which occupy so large a portion of the intellectual and physical powers of man the employment of the physical powers of the lower animals in conducting the operations of art enables mankind to devote a larger share of intellectual energy towards their improvement and affords a power more certain in its operation more susceptible of every modification more extensively applicable and more completely under control than any mechanical forces ever contrived by man the employment of animals in the operations of agriculture is almost coeval with the existence of the human race their use is no less ancient and important in the operations of war in travelling hunting conveying over land the productions of industry and commerce and in communicating or regulating the motion of engines and machinery used in the arts or in the common intercourse of society the horse the elephant the camel the dromedary the ox the ass the mule the reindeer the dog the lama and the buffalo have long employed their physical strength in the service of mankind horses were as common in the armies of the pharaohs and of the israelites and at the trojan war as at the present day soloman had forty thousand stalls for the horses of his household and employed dromedaries as beasts of burthen armed elephants were used in the persian armies before the invasions of alexander the great and were even marched into the centre of italy dogs were employed by the lydians to hunt the boars of mount olympus before the time of herodotus regular posts were established in persia by means of horses before the time of xerxes camels were used in travelling in the days of abraham about years before christ and they were employed as beasts of burthen by the persians in their wars against the lydians cyrus gained a signal victory over the forces of croesus by employing a troop of camels to frighten the horses of the lydian prince hannibal struck terror into the roman army by a night stratagem vith oxen asses were employed by the israelites as beasts of burthen four thousand years ago as they are employed in the same countries at the present time we employ the watchfulness of the dog the cat and some other domestic animals to protect our property we employ trie strength of the elephant and the fleetness of the horse to defend our lives from danger bats birds and insectivorous quadrupeds check the ravages of insects and protect the fruits of the field for our use birds and insects by devouring the putrid carcases of animals check the infectious emanations which otherwise would corrupt the air carnivorous quadrupeds and rapacious birds form a necessary restraint to the too rapid increase of the weaker tribes which find a neverfailing abundance of food in the vegetable covering of the earth we make use of innumerable productions of the animal kingdom to ornament our person or property the tusks of the elephant and of many other quadrupeds supply
