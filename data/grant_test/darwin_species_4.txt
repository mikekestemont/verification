of the plant bees will act like a camelhair pencil and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species for if you bring on the same brush a plants own pollen and pollen from another species the former will have such a prepotent effect that it will invariably and completely destroy as has been shown by gärtner any influence from the foreign pollen when the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil or slowly move one after the other towards it the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure selffertilisation and no doubt it is useful for this end but the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward as kölreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry and curiously in this very genus which seems to have a special contrivance for selffertilisation it is well known that if very closelyallied forms or varieties are planted near each other it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings so largely do they naturally cross in many other cases far from there being any aids for selffertilisation there are special contrivances as i could show from the writings of c c sprengel and from my own observations which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower for instance in lobelia fulgens there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollengranules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them and as this flower is never visited at least in my garden by insects it never sets a seed though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another i raised plenty of seedlings and whilst another species of lobelia growing close by which is visited by bees seeds freely in very many other cases though there be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen yet as c c sprengel has shown and as i can confirm either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready so that these plants have in fact separated sexes and must habitually be crossed how strange are these facts how strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower though placed so close together as if for the very purpose of selffertilisation should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other how simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable if several varieties of the cabbage radish onion and of some other plants be allowed to seed near each other a large majority as i have found of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels for instance i raised seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other and of these only were true to their kind and some even of these were not perfectly true yet the pistil of each cabbageflower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant how then comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized i suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over a flowers own pollen and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species when distinct species are crossed the case is directly the reverse for a plants own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter in the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense i believe this objection to be valid but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes when the sexes are separated although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree that trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants i find to be the case in this country and at my request dr hooker tabulated the trees of new zealand and dr asa gray those of the united states and the result was as i anticipated on the other hand dr hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in australia and i have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject turning for a very brief space to animals on the land there are some hermaphrodites as landmollusca and earthworms but these all pair as yet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself we can understand this remarkable fact which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live and the nature of the fertilising element for we know of no means analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals of aquatic animals there are many selffertilising hermaphrodites but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross and as in the case of flowers i have as yet failed after consultation with one of the highest authorities namely professor huxley to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view but i have been enabled by a fortunate chance elsewhere to prove that two individuals though both are selffertilising hermaphrodites do sometimes cross it must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that in the case of both animals and plants species of the same family and even of the same genus though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation yet are not rarely some of them hermaphrodites and some of them unisexual but if in fact all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species as far as function is concerned becomes very small from these several considerations and from the many special facts which i have collected but which i am not here able to give i am strongly inclined to suspect that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature i am well aware that there are on this view many cases of difficulty some of which i am trying to investigate finally then we may conclude that in many organic beings a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals but in none as i suspect can selffertilisation go on for perpetuity circumstances favourable to natural selectionthis is an extremely intricate subject a large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable but i believe mere individual differences suffice for the work a large number of individuals by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual and is i believe an extremely important element of success though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection she does not grant an indefinite period for as all organic beings are striving it may be said to seize on each place in the economy of nature if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors it will soon be exterminated in mans methodical selection a breeder selects for some definite object and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work but when many men without intending to alter the breed have a nearly common standard of perfection and all try to get and breed from the best animals much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals thus it will be in nature for within a confined area with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction though in different degrees so as better to fill up the unoccupied place but if the area be large its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each and in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each for in a continuous area the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another the intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth which wander much and which do not breed at a very quick rate hence in animals of this nature for instance in birds varieties will generally be confined to separated countries and this i believe to be the case in hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally and likewise in animals which unite for each birth but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot and might there maintain itself in a body so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety a local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts on the above principle nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened even in the case of slowbreeding animals which unite for each birth we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts showing that within the same area varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct from haunting different stations from breeding at slightly different seasons or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species or of the same variety true and uniform in character it will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth but i have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants even if these take place only at long intervals i am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from longcontinued selffertilisation that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind and thus in the long run the influence of intercrosses even at rare intervals will be great if there exist organic beings which never intercross uniformity of character can be retained amongst them as long as their conditions of life remain the same only through the principle of inheritance and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations isolation also is an important element in the process of natural selection in a confined or isolated area if not very large the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions intercrosses also with the individuals of the same species which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts will be prevented but isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms after any physical change such as of climate or elevation of the land c and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for and become adapted to through modifications in their structure and constitution lastly isolation by checking immigration and consequently competition will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species if however an isolated area be very small either from being surrounded by barriers or from having very peculiar physical conditions the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations if we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks and look at any small isolated area such as an oceanic island although the total number of the species inhabiting it will be found to be small as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution yet of these species a very large proportion are endemicthat is have been produced there and nowhere else hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species but we may thus greatly deceive ourselves for to ascertain whether a small isolated area or a large open area like a continent has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms we ought to make the comparison within equal times and this we are incapable of doing although i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species on the whole i am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance more especially in the production of species which will prove capable of enduring for a long period and of spreading widely throughout a great and open area not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species and if some of these many species become modified and improved others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated each new form also as soon as it has been much improved will be able to spread over the open and continuous area and will thus come into competition with many others hence more new places will be formed and the competition to fill them will be more severe on a large than on a small and isolated area moreover great areas though now continuous owing to oscillations of level will often have recently existed in a broken condition so that the good effects of isolation will generally to a certain extent have concurred finally i conclude that although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas and what is more important that the new forms produced on large areas which already have been victorious over many competitors will be those that will spread most widely will give rise to most new varieties and species and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world we can perhaps on these views understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution for instance that the productions of the smaller continent of australia have formerly yielded and apparently are now yielding before those of the larger europæoasiatic area thus also it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands on a small island the race for life will have been less severe and there will have been less modification and less extermination hence perhaps it comes that the flora of madeira according to oswald heer resembles the extinct tertiary flora of europe all freshwater basins taken together make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land and consequently the competition between freshwater productions will have been less severe than elsewhere new forms will have been more slowly formed and old forms more slowly exterminated and it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of ganoid fishes remnants of a once preponderant order and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world as the ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren which like fossils connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale these anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils they have endured to the present day from having inhabited a confined area and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition to sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits i conclude looking to the future that for terrestrial productions a large continental area which will probably undergo many oscillations of level and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition will be the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life likely to endure long and to spread widely for the area will first have existed as a continent and the inhabitants at this period numerous in individuals and kinds will have been subjected to very severe competition when converted by subsidence into large separate islands there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked after physical changes of any kind immigration will be prevented so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected when by renewed elevation the islands shall be reconverted into a continental area there will again be severe competition the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread there will be much extinction of the less improved forms and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants and thus produce new species that natural selection will always act with extreme slowness i fully admit its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind the existence of such places will often depend on physical changes which are generally very slow and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked but the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process the process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection i do not believe so on the other hand i do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly often only at long intervals of time and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time i further believe that this very slow intermit tent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed slow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amount of change to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of life which may be effected in the long course of time by natures power of selection extinctionthis subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on geology but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous which consequently endure but as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare rarity as geology tells us is the precursor to extinction we can also see that any form represented by few individuals will during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies run a good chance of utter extinction but we may go further than this for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably must become extinct that the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased geology shows us plainly and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely greatnot that we have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species probably no region is as yet fully stocked for at the cape of good hope where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world some foreign plants have become naturalised without causing as far as we know the extinction of any natives furthermore the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations we have evidence of this in the facts given in the second chapter showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties or incipient species hence rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species from these several considerations i think it inevitably follows that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection others will become rarer and rarer and finally extinct the forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement will naturally suffer most and we have seen in the chapter on the struggle for existence that it is the most closelyallied formsvarieties of the same species and species of the same genus or of related generawhich from having nearly the same structure constitution and habits generally come into the severest competition with each other consequently each new variety or species during the progress of its formation will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred and tend to exterminate them we see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions through the selection of improved forms by man many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle sheep and other animals and varieties of flowers take the place of older and inferior kinds in yorkshire it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the longhorns and that these were swept away by the shorthorns i quote the words of an agricultural writer as if by some murderous pestilence divergence of characterthe principle which i have designated by this term is of high importance on my theory and explains as i believe several important facts in the first place varieties even stronglymarked ones though having somewhat of the character of speciesas is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank themyet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species nevertheless according to my view varieties are species in the process of formation or are as i have called them incipient species how then does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species that this does habitually happen we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting wellmarked differences whereas varieties the supposed prototypes and parents of future wellmarked species present slight and illdefined differences mere chance as we may call it might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus as has always been my practice let us seek light on this head from our domestic productions we shall here find something analogous a fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak and on the acknowledged principle that fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard but like extremes they both go on as has actually occurred with tumblerpigeons choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks or with shorter and shorter beaks again we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses another stronger and more bulky horses the early differences would be very slight in the course of time from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders and of stronger ones by others the differences would become greater and would be noted as forming two subbreeds finally after the lapse of centuries the subbreeds would become converted into two wellestablished and distinct breeds as the differences slowly become greater the inferior animals with intermediate characters being neither very swift nor very strong will have been neglected and will have tended to disappear here then we see in mans productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence causing differences at first barely appreciable steadily to increase and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent but how it may be asked can any analogous principle apply in nature i believe it can and does apply most efficiently from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure constitution and habits by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature and so be enabled to increase in numbers we can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits take the case of a carnivorous quadruped of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average if its natural powers of increase be allowed to act it can succeed in increasing the country not undergoing any change in its conditions only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals some of them for instance being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey either dead or alive some inhabiting new stations climbing trees frequenting water and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous the more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became the more places they would be enabled to occupy what applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animalsthat is if they varyfor otherwise natural selection can do nothing so it will be with plants it has been experimentally proved that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised the same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground hence if any one species of grass were to go on varying and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass including its modified descendants would succeed in living on the same piece of ground and we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds and thus as it may be said is striving its utmost to increase its numbers consequently i cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties and varieties when rendered very distinct from each other take the rank of species the truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure is seen under many natural circumstances in an extremely small area especially if freely open to immigration and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe we always find great diversity in its inhabitants for instance i found that a piece of turf three feet by four in size which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions supported twenty species of plants and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders which shows how much these plants differed from each other so it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets and so in small ponds of fresh water farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground could live on it supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there but it is seen that where they come into the closest competition with each other the advantages of diversification of structure with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution determine that the inhabitants which thus jostle each other most closely shall as a general rule belong to what we call different genera and orders the same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through mans agency in foreign lands it might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country it might also perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes but the case is very different and alph de candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work that floras gain by naturalisation proportionally with the number of the native genera and species far more in new genera than in new species to give a single instance in the last edition of dr asa grays manual of the flora of the northern united states naturalised plants are enumerated and these belong to genera we thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature they differ moreover to a large extent from the indigenes for out of the genera no less than genera are not there indigenous and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these states by considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country and have there become naturalised we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified in order to have gained an advantage over the other natives and we may i think at least safely infer that diversification of structure amounting to new generic differences would have been profitable to them the advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is in fact the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual bodya subject so well elucidated by milne edwards no physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone or flesh alone draws most nutriment from these substances so in the general economy of any land the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves a set of animals with their organisation but little diversified could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure it may be doubted for instance whether the australian marsupials which are divided into groups differing but little from each other and feebly representing as mr waterhouse and others have remarked our carnivorous ruminant and rodent mammals could successfully compete with these wellpronounced orders in the australian mammals we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development after the foregoing discussion which ought to have been much amplified we may i think assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings now let us see how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of character combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction will tend to act the accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject let a to l represent the species of a genus large in its own country these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances i have said a large genus because we have seen in the second chapter that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties we have also seen that the species which are the commonest and the most widelydiffused vary more than rare species with restricted ranges let a be a common widelydiffused and varying species belonging to a genus large in its own country the little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from a may represent its varying offspring the variations are supposed to be extremely slight but of the most diversified nature they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously but often after long intervals of time nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected and here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations represented by the outer dotted lines being preserved and accumulated by natural selection when a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines and is there marked by a small numbered letter a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly wellmarked variety such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work the intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram may represent each a thousand generations but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations after a thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced two fairly wellmarked varieties namely a and m these two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary consequently they will tend to vary and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied moreover these two varieties being only slightly modified forms will tend to inherit those advantages which made their common parent a more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parentspecies belonged a large genus in its own country and these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties if then these two varieties be variable the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations and after this interval variety a is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a which will owing to the principle of divergence differ more from a than did variety a variety m is supposed to have produced two varieties namely m and s differing from each other and more considerably from their common parent a we may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time some of the varieties after each thousand generations producing only a single variety but in a more and more modified condition some producing two or three varieties and some failing to produce any thus the varieties or modified descendants proceeding from the common parent a will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character in the diagram the process is represented up to the tenthousandth generation and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteenthousandth generation but i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram though in itself made somewhat irregular i am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply a medium form may often long endure and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings and this will depend on infinitely complex relations but as a general rule the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered the more places they will be enabled to seize on and the more their modified progeny will be increased in our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties but these breaks are imaginary and might have been inserted anywhere after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation as all the modified descendants from a common and widelydiffused species belonging to a large genus will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from a the modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent will it is probable often take the place of and so destroy the earlier and less improved branches this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines in some cases i do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent and the number of the descendants will not be increased although the amount of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations this case would be represented in the diagram if all the lines proceeding from a were removed excepting that from a to a in the same way for instance the english racehorse and english pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks without either having given off any fresh branches or races after ten thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced three forms a f and m which from having diverged in character during the successive generations will have come to differ largely but perhaps unequally from each other and from their common parent if we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small these three forms may still be only wellmarked varieties or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of subspecies but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount to convert these three forms into welldefined species thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species by continuing the same process for a greater number of generations as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner we get eight species marked by the letters between a and m all descended from a thus as i believe species are multiplied and genera are formed in a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary in the diagram i have assumed that a second species i has produced by analogous steps after ten thousand generations either two wellmarked varieties w and z or two species according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines after fourteen thousand generations six new species marked by the letters n to z are supposed to have been produced in each genus the species which are already extremely different in character will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature hence in the diagram i have chosen the extreme species a and the nearly extreme species i as those which have largely varied and have given rise to new varieties and species the other nine species marked by capital letters of our original genus may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space but during the process of modification represented in the diagram another of our principles namely that of extinction will have played an important part as in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent for it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits constitution and structure hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states that is between the less and more improved state of a species as well as the original parentspecies itself will generally tend to become extinct so it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent if however the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country or become quickly adapted to some quite new station in which child and parent do not come into competition both may continue to exist if then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification species a and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct having been replaced by eight new species a to m and i will have been replaced by six n to z new species but we may go further than this the original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature species a being more nearly related to b c and d than to the other species and species i more to g h k l than to the others these two species a and i were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus their modified descendants fourteen in number at the fourteenthousandth generation will probably have inherited some of the same advantages they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country it seems therefore to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of and thus exterminated not only their parents a and i but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteenthousandth generation we may suppose that only one f of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent the new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species will now be fifteen in number owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection the extreme amount of difference in character between species a and z will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species the new species moreover will be allied to each other in a widely different manner of the eight descendants from a the three marked a q p will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a b and f from having diverged at an earlier period from a will be in some degree distinct from the three firstnamed species and lastly o e and m will be nearly related one to the other but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification will be widely different from the other five species and may constitute a subgenus or even a distinct genus the six descendants from i will form two subgenera or even genera but as the original species i differed largely from a standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus the six descendants from i will owing to inheritance differ considerably from the eight descendants from a the two groups moreover are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions the intermediate species also and this is a very important consideration which connected the original species a and i have all become excepting f extinct and have left no descendants hence the six new species descended from i and the eight descended from a will have to be ranked as very distinct genera or even as distinct subfamilies thus it is as i believe that two or more genera are produced by descent with modification from two or more species of the same genus and the two or more parentspecies are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus in our diagram this is indicated by the broken lines beneath the capital letters converging in subbranches downwards towards a single point this point representing a single species the supposed single parent of our several new subgenera and genera it is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species f which is supposed not to have diverged much in character but to have retained the form of f either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree in this case its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature having descended from a form which stood between the two parentspecies a and i now supposed to be extinct and unknown it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species but as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents the new species f will not be directly intermediate between them but rather between types of the two groups and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind in the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations but each may represent a million or hundred million generations and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earths crust including extinct remains we shall when we come to our chapter on geology have to refer again to this subject and i think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings which though generally belonging to the same orders or families or genera with those now living yet are often in some degree intermediate in character between existing groups and we can understand this fact for the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less i see no reason to limit the process of modification as now explained to the formation of genera alone if in our diagram we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great the forms marked a to p those marked b and f and those marked o to m will form three very distinct genera we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from i and as these latter two genera both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent will differ widely from the three genera descended from a the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families or even orders according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram and the two new families or orders will have descended from two species of the original genus and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus we have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species this indeed might have been expected for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common hence the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups which are all trying to increase in number one large group will slowly conquer another large group reduce its numbers and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement within the same large group the later and more highly perfected subgroups from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved subgroups small and broken groups and subgroups will finally tend to disappear looking to the future we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant and which are least broken up that is which as yet have suffered least extinction will for a long period continue to increase but which groups will ultimately prevail no man can predict for we well know that many groups formerly most extensively developed have now become extinct looking still more remotely to the future we may predict that owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct and leave no modified descendants and consequently that of the species living at any one period extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity i shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification but i may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants yet at the most remote geological period the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera families orders and classes as at the present day summary of chapterif during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation and i think this cannot be disputed if there be owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species at some age season or year a severe struggle for life and this certainly cannot be disputed then considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence causing an infinite diversity in structure constitution and habits to be advantageous to them i think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each beings own welfare in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man but if variations useful to any organic being do occur assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised this principle of preservation i have called for the sake of brevity natural selection natural selection on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages can modify the egg seed or young as easily as the adult amongst many animals sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone in their struggles with other males whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters but we already see how it entails extinction and how largely extinction has acted in the worlds history geology plainly declares natural selection also leads to divergence of character for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot or at naturalised productions therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers the more diversified these descendants become the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of life thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus or even of distinct genera we have seen that it is the common the widelydiffused and widelyranging species belonging to the larger genera which vary most and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries natural selection as has just been remarked leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life on these principles i believe the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained it is a truly wonderful factthe wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiaritythat all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group in the manner which we everywhere beholdnamely varieties of the same species most closely related together species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together forming sections and subgenera species of distinct genera much less closely related and genera related in different degrees forming subfamilies families orders subclasses and classes the several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file but seem rather to be clustered round points and these round other points and so on in almost endless cycles on the view that each species has been independently created i can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings but to the best of my judgment it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection entailing extinction and divergence of character as we have seen illustrated in the diagram the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree i believe this simile largely speaks the truth the green and budding twigs may represent existing species and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life the limbs divided into great branches and these into lesser and lesser branches were themselves once when the tree was small budding twigs and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush only two or three now grown into great branches yet survive and bear all the other branches so with the species which lived during longpast geological periods very few now have living and modified descendants from the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living representatives and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from
